Most often, they can let you re-roll, or some of them can add 1d6 to your roll.  The thing that always bothered me was, at the end of the night you roll 1d6 for each Bennie you have left, and you could possibly gain some experience if they roll 4-6.<br/><br/>Which seems completely upside-down.  If the adventure is totally easy, and you don't engage or try anything risky, you get more experience?  But if you get your butt handed to you and surf the edge, you get nothing?<br/><br/>So we let people roll a die (at the end of the session) for those they had <i>spent</i> instead.  Everyone was warned ahead of time, and paced themselves through their Bennies as the session went on.<br/><br/>It was really cool, and I'm wondering if anyone else has done anything like this before?<br/><br/>Even with a different system, I'd be interested to read about thematic changes to the rules.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301357/#Comment_301357" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T22:44:03+00:00" title="November 18, 2010 10:44PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D, there you get more XP the more your character does in the game.<br/><br/>I like the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301360/#Comment_301360" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T23:11:54+00:00" title="November 18, 2010 11:11PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HeroQuest makes (made?) that same design mistake, it always annoyed me there as well; you basically had to choose between real short-term effectiveness and nebulous long-term effectiveness you'd gain if you somehow managed to scrape together a zillion hero points and never spent them to get your way in the game. In that game the newbie mistake used to be to hoard those points; at least the sort of campaigns I play, you never could collect enough points for it to actually matter as a character development option, while spending those same points in the real time, conflict-by-conflict, would enable your character to play on an entirely different level from the poor guys who tried to be conservative and save up for a power-up that never comes in the real world. Obviously enough I soon adopted the same fix you have there: allow only the points that are spent in play to be used as xp, thus encouraging character activity instead of character passivity.<br/><br/>My only explanation for this phenomenon is that this sort of mechanic is chosen by a designer who is not quite comfortable with encouraging discretionary resource usage (hero points, bennies, whatever) from the players; somewhere in his cranium the little thought niggles him, demanding him to somehow enable the "good" player who conservers his resources and does not "cheat" by pushing through the hard parts by spending evil metagame currency. I guess that sort of makes sense if you think that adversity is only a GM-controlled option in an adventure, and therefore players who are using their bennies are actually having it easier than the ones who don't use them. Of course in a less railroady game the truth is that the player with more opportunities will often also do more and thus provoke more adversity for himself, which skews the mechanism by not actually making play any "easier" for the bennies-happy player, but simply more exciting and action-packed. The poor turtle player might get a few experience points as a reward for doing nothing, but you'll need to be really character-centric as a player to care about that when the other guys are actually doing things in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301362/#Comment_301362" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T23:50:58+00:00" title="November 18, 2010 11:50PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They've removed the Bennies-for-XP mechanic as of the most recent edition of Savage Worlds.<br/><br/>7th Sea used to do the same thing with its Drama Dice, and it's basically a broken mechanic, as it encourages people to hoard things the game wants them to use.

Nobody ever uses the special because the small bonus is just too much good over the long term.<br/><br/>If we're talking about games that reward you for doing stuff/getting into trouble, Burning Wheel, Mouse Guard and Apocalypse World come instantly to mind. Chaosium's system also rewards players by increasing their skills if they use them. And so on. But I guess this is not exactly what you're after?<br/><br/>I haven't gotten the chance to do this yet, but here's something I want to do with oD&amp;D: Characters get XP for <i>Gold Spent</i>, not acquired. I think this would make it even more like old sword &amp; sorcery where the characters are broke in each next adventure. It would require a non-dick DM that would give a lot of opportunities for spending gold, and to get my favourite flavour, magic items would just not be for sale (except maybe some more mundane ones).<br/><br/>So it retains the old logic that it's important to get the treasure (by bypassing and overcoming challenges), not to fight the monsters. But once you have the treasure, you have to spend it. It would be fun to watch characters blow thousands and thousands of goldpieces on courtisans, drink, lodgings with silk sheets, exotic foods, exquisite weapons (that just weren't made for fighting), see their tastes grow ever more baroque and bizzare, always wasting away huge amounts of money until they finally have enough to just buy a castle and say "fuck it". For clerics there's the opportunity to donate money or invest in their church, for wizards there's always tomes and bizzare equipments etc.<br/><br/>Oh and one emergent property I'd expect is that people would buy less equipment as char creation to spend the gold ingame later for that little advantage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301424/#Comment_301424" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T07:46:30+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  7:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even indie darling Lady Blackbird makes this design mistake.

Instead, I gave out XP tokens to everyone (say 1 token = 1 xp for World of Darkness and similar games, 1 token = considerably more xp for D&amp;D and the like) which they could award during play, so when you see one person get a token you sort of instinctively save yours for the next cool thing that happens.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's only sort of relevant, as these tokens had no in-game effects because I'd discovered that when XP and in-game bennies interact, long-term disappointment tends to result. ("I wish I hadn't blown my chance at a whole new Skill on saving our bacon from that Ork.")<br/><br/>What does work, though, is the ability to spend XP <i>during play</i>, so that a player may make a decision like this:<br/><br/>PLAYER A: "This is a good time to show off my improved Drive skill!"<br/>PLAYER B: "You bought up your Drive skill?"<br/>PLAYER A: "I'm doing it right now!" <br/><br/>This can involve some buyer's remorse, too, except that players, in my experience, enjoy knowing that they're putting points into skills that are actually seeing active use, and not just into things that they (a) hope will see use or (b) bought up because they failed the last time they needed it. This means that XP, when it's in ample supply, <i>is</i> the benny <i>and</i> that characters reflect their adventures, since they put XP into skills as they use them. <br/><br/>(A variation on this mechanism is one of the core mechanics of my in-development robotics game, <i>Databank</i>, by the way.)<br/><br/>Anyway. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301500/#Comment_301500" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-19T21:30:52+00:00" title="November 19, 2010  9:30PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One guy actually died a game I ran because he refused to soak damage as he actually seemed under the impression getting XP was worth dying.

In the WEG Star Wars system, you got Character Points, which could be extra dice or used as XP to increase skills and attributes. When we played in college in a two person game, I always hoarded my CPs in order to buy up some Force powers. As a result, my character often failed or barely made rolls. The other player (Norwood) would burn CPs like candy, and he was always awesome. It was fun to see how the two of us got through missions, fun to see different play-styles covering the bases in a two person game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301824/#Comment_301824" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T01:46:58+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  1:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2010 1:54AM by John_Harper.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird works that way because sometimes it's a one-shot (where the dice bonus is more useful) and sometimes it's a longer game (where adding traits and secrets is better). Since I had so little space, I included a mechanic that could cover both cases without a lot of explanation. Maybe not the best solution, though.<br/><br/>(The next version of LB will avoid the issue. I'm re-working it so you don't need huge piles of dice to play, and the dice pool vs. xp thing will go away as a consequence of that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
