A rolls, B counters with his own roll. If A beats B then B takes a Hit. Once he's taken a few of these, he's out. No hit points, just a small tally of Hits (though they are eminently functional, I find HP a bit dull). If B beats A then B has the advantage and A has to roll again as the situation is reversed. Here we get the ebb and flow of combat. No real need, beyond establishing who goes first (which might be represented with a simple bonus to A's initial roll), for regimented initiative/turn based systems. This even applies to gunfights: you get the ebb and flow there too, like in a John Woo movie, blam blam!<br/><br/>Problem is what if A attacks B, but B is intending not to duel A. This system is great for a straight duel, but if B is attacking C and C is attacking A, what happens? Does A automatically hit B who automatically hits C who hits A etc? Maybe?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407857/#Comment_407857" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-03T05:48:40+00:00" title="March  3, 2013  5:48AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the setting, or the tone you're looking for?

Allow characters to be in multiple simultaneous duels at one time. So, they don't have to choose. Maybe allow characters the ability to defend against any incomming attacks, but only initiate an attack once per round. Lots of design choices here.<br/><br/>From some of the films I've seen the hero either senses the attack at the last minute or maybe takes a hit and is knocked off balance before he regroups and goes into a duel with the new guy.<br/><br/>So another thought, would be that the surprise attack can't injure the target, but gives them a penalty to their next action. Allowing the guy to start dueling but at a disadvantage.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407918/#Comment_407918" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T00:29:33+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 12:29AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2013 12:34AM by Rickard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To solve your problem, let the one who rolls best be the attacker.

That's something like the Sorcerer combat system.<br/><br/>Or do you want it to be a difficult choice? "Damn, do I risk exposing myself to whatever A is going to do to me, is it worth it just to nail C?" Then create some kind of powerful (but still interesting) result for when A hits B.

Don't the fights usually end with one person on the ground, defeated, and the other standing over them, sword drawn?<br/><br/>I could be wrong, but if that's how it works, it makes the mechanics easy: don't include any chance of death in the fight, just a chance of completely dominating the loser, having them at your mercy.

I agree with Adam because its much more important what you want the wuxia game experience to be like than it is that you "have some kind of order/initiative system that encompasses all combatants and what they do." There are games that treat combats like duels and have various different ways to deal with multiple combatants. Burning Wheel is a good example, combat is essentially modeled between two participants with a positioning system that gives one the advantage each exchange. However, you can have a third person attacking one of them and the free attacker would roll an unopposed strike. Given the system, that's not the same as a guaranteed hit. In Mouse Guard, if two characters attack third, one attacker rolls and the other attacker helps. However, if one attacks and the other maneuvers, you might see two rolls.<br/><br/>You could easily model all fights as duels, but allow characters to have multiple simultaneous duels going on. That would certainly fit a Jackie chan fight sequence where he's changing opponents all willy nilly. <br/><br/>So, the question is really what does <i>your</i> wuxia look and feel like.<br/><br/>My comment about FATE was in response to your suggestion that it might not be possible to model frenetic fast paced combat in a game, and that RPG systems aren't good at this kind of thing. I'm curious what systems have you tried? I think FATE does a great over the top action sequence, but that's how my wuxia looks.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408085/#Comment_408085" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T00:34:34+00:00" title="March  5, 2013 12:34AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean to say, why do you think fate handles wuxia particularly well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408086/#Comment_408086" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T00:44:48+00:00" title="March  5, 2013 12:44AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also want to recommend Dan Bayn's Wushu system, where you have a lot of furious back-and-forth action without initiative.

Same mechanic as combat, but Hits are gains in position, like circling someone or cutting them off (if that's your intent) or losing someone or leaving them in the dust (if that's your intent).  If the person with the aggressive intent (A, in this example) scores enough Positional Hits, then combat begins, and B must fight or die.<br/><br/>If you want to allow people to escape from the middle of combat, create a Hit requirement for turning the fight into a Chase.  Example: if you land 3 consecutive hits, you can opt to turn the 3rd Hit into a Positional Hit, ending the combat and beginning a Chase.\n<blockquote>if B is attacking C and C is attacking A, what happens? Does A automatically hit B who automatically hits C who hits A etc?</blockquote>\nYes.  I don't think that will ever happen, though, except in some weird death pact scene.  <br/><br/>The A-B-C situation I'd worry about would be A and B attacking C.  In that case, I'd go with:<br/><br/>Compare C's roll vs the highest roll of A and B.

I don't realistically see any way around it, however you resolve the process. For example, if you have a combat scene in which the heroes want to defeat the villains and stop them from using the targetting computer to luanch their Death Missile, you need to know if the heroes can reach them first. <br/>To that point, if you have a system that resolves initiative from the same result as the action roll you need to have a way to incorporate diceless actions (is a roll needed to launch the missile?) into that order. This system also means that the GM has more work as he will have to make a roll for every enemy/group of mooks present to determine their initiative. That alone puts me off. Even so I don't see it being any quicker: you still have a process of roll, calculate, compare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408092/#Comment_408092" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T02:39:01+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  2:39AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like the ebb and flow mechanic!

When that happens in wuxia, it's separated by cuts between combat A and combat B at dramatically-timed intervals.  The screen is not interested in tracking more than two "sides" at a time.<br/><br/>Multiple antagonists could roll multiple dice, but still take the highest to achieve a single Hit.  There's your ebb and flow -- the mooks collectively beat down the hero, or the hero beats down the full mass of mooks.<br/><br/>Multiple player characters could do the same when allied -- both roll, highest roll applies to the enemy.<br/><br/>When player 1 fights boss 1 and player 2 fights boss 2, I'd say cut back and forth between them using Hits as dramatic cues -- for example, whenever any side reaches 2/3 or 1/3 of their Hits, cut.  I don't see any reason to use in-fiction time to measure how long it takes player 1 to kill boss 1 before he can help player 2.  Dramatic beats should work.\n<blockquote>For example, if you have a combat scene in which the heroes want to defeat the villains and stop them from using the targeting computer to launch their Death Missile, you need to know if the heroes can reach them first. </blockquote>To me, this issue sounds well outside the scope of the mechanic you've introduced here.  I'd guess you'll have to make totally separate design decisions on how to determine such things -- very high-level stuff, like what the GM's job is, what constitutes good GMing, and what sorts of in-fiction events get die rolls.  <br/><br/>If you're positing a situation in which <i>you know you want a roll for whether the heroes get there in time</i>, then in that context, I assume what you'd need is a cool "race" mechanic.  Maybe do what I suggested with the Chase, but instead of Positional Hits, they're Task Hits?  The villains need to score a certain number of Hits to complete their task of missile launch, while the heroes need to complete their task of getting to the villains.  If the villains land their required Hits first, the missile is launched, and if the heroes land their required Hits first, they reach the villains before the villains have pressed the button, and can then initiate a launch-delaying Combat or Chase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408105/#Comment_408105" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T05:39:52+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  5:39AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, how about (hopefully this text is clear):<br/><br/>Combat occurs within a limited sequence of moves, back and forth, known as exchanges. One exchange, regardless of who is participating, must resolve before another. <br/><br/>The current Chi of each participant within an exchange determines how many moves they can perform. Each move is one action attempt beginning with the attacker. If a hero has no moves left he may spend Chi points directly to act, otherwise he loses the exchange. When one party loses an exchange it is over and the consequence is resolved. Combatants without Chi are defenceless.<br/><br/>Starting with the attacker\u2019s first move, a roll is made. Now the defender must use his first move to roll using an appropriate defensive skill. To continue the exchange he must roll greater than the attacker\u2019s result, if not he loses. The attacker is now forced to do likewise; in this fashion the exchange continues until one party loses, either through failing to roll greater or through running out of moves.<br/><br/>If a combatant loses he submits to either 1 Wound or the non lethal consequence imposed by the opponent. To escape, a combatant must successfully roll greater than his opponent consecutively X times, where X is the difficulty of the manoeuvre. Escape is required for any combatant to move away and attend to something else. It is possible for a combatant to change his mind within an exchange and try and escape, but he must then use an appropriate Skill. Successful skill rolls made while attempting to escape do not inflict damage and if the opponent loses before X is reached the escape succeeds.<br/><br/>When the exchange is over the winning combatant decides who acts next. Choosing a character on the same side costs 1 point of Chi.<br/><br/>Note this doesn't address who gets to act first or deal with surprise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408121/#Comment_408121" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T08:12:52+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  8:12AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>For some reason this brings to mind an old drinking game I played years ago that might have the feel of just what you are looking for.  This would be a real odd ball resolution system like the use of Jenga in Dread but if you can get around the weirdness it might be worth trying.<br/><br/>So when I played the game it was called Zoom-Schwartz-Profigliano.  <br/><br/>The rules were very simple.  The game begins by one player saying "Has anyone heard of the game zoom, schwartz, profigliano.  He would then look directly at one person and say "zoom" which acts like a 'tag your it' move.  The player who was just zoomed then has 3 options.  He can either look directly back and say "Schwartz" which bounces the tag back to the original player, he can look at another player and say "Zoom" tagging the new player, or he can look at someone different and say "profigliano" which is a misdirect move because it bounces the tag back to the originator without having to look at them.<br/><br/>As a drinking game if at any point you screwed up you had to drink, in an rpg context you could say it was a hit.  If you look at the person who zoomed you and zoom them back that's a mistake,  if you schwartz or zoom when you've been profigliano'd you made a mistake, if you dont reply quick enough that's a mistake.  The thing that brought it back to mind is that it is really fast paced when you get going and you get the excitment and feel of exchanging blows.

Let's do this!<br/><br/>There are quite a few FATE variants out there, but I'll use FATE Core since it's the flavor of the month coming off a successful Kickstarter.<br/><br/>Anyway, in combat goes like so: You determine move order by comparing everyone's Notice skill. Combat is divided into exchanges with everyone getting one turn per exchange. On your turn you can take an action. On other characters' turns you can respond to their actions, including defending. When you take an action you can either attack, create an advantage, or overcome an obstacle.<br/><br/>So, it's Hu Fei's turn and he decides to attack the evil Feng Tiannan. He does a 40' wire-fu flying side kick, rolling the Fate dice and adding the result to his Kung Fu Fighting for a total of 7. Feng Tiannan rolls the Fate dice and adds his Athletic skill and gets a massive 10, beating him by 3 which is called "succeeding with Style." So, he describes how he jumps 50' feet straight up, right over the head of the attacking Hu Fei. Since he succeeded with Style, he gets a little boost to his next action, which he writes on an index card as "Hu Fei's lost me in the sun." Now it's the evil Feng Tiannan's turn and he decides to create an advantage by knocking Hu Fei off balance, which he does by plummeting towards the hapless Hu Fei. He rolls Kung Fu Fighting but rolls poorly only achieving a total of 4. Hu Fei's Athleticism roll of 5 would soundly defend against that, but the evil Feng Tiannan invokes his boost, "Hu Fei's lost me in the sun," since Hu Fei can't see him coming. This brings his attack to 6 and he has created an advantage. He gives Hu Fei the aspect "Knocked spinning" as Hu Fei is sent spinning through the air like a top. He writes the aspect "Hu Fei's gone for a spin" on an index card. That's when Hu Fei's friend, Hu Yidao, goes on the attack arcing across the sky with a massive punch. He rolls and gets a total of 7, the evil Feng Tiannan uses his Kung Fu Fighting to block getting a 3, but spends a Fate point to invoke his aspect "Inner Dragon Style Kung Fu" for a +2 and then takes the free invoke on "Hu Fei's gone for a spin", describing how Hu Yidao has to dodge the out of control Hu Fei. So that's another +2, giving him a 7 which ties Hu Yidao's attack. Although this is enough to block Hu Yidao's attack, it's only just barely so. Hu Yidao gets a boost of his own and writes down "Wrung like a bell" as he describes how his Dancing Tiger style has sent his Chi reverberating through Feng Tiannan. He'll invoke that later on his action or to defend, or he'll pass it to Hu Fei to use on his next action. That's the full exchange. It's Hu Fei's turn now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408225/#Comment_408225" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T00:09:06+00:00" title="March  6, 2013 12:09AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Game design is very challenging to do, and IMHO it's important not to be too attached to any one game mechanic when you're making a game.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, that.

The example didn't really have anything to do with the system at all. You could've used any kind of genre - film noir, swashbuckling, space opera - and the system would've been suitable for that. Sure, you created aspects the but the aspects were heavily influenced by the genre and the tropes within. The only thing that the system did was allowing the players to take care of their descriptions. You could as easily have used Vampire or any other non-crunchy trad game in your example, and left it to the players to describe their actions.<br/><br/>And neither FATE or Wushu has nothing to do with the only thing that the OP demanded: ebb and flow. [edit] Or did you mean that advantages in FATE symbolized ebb and flow? I got the notion that the OP was talking about a fluid initiative change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408229/#Comment_408229" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T03:08:08+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  3:08AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>I'm sure those games do include interesting ideas, why not tell me what they are.

The aspects are the unique thing and I'm not convinced I want to use fate points. I'm not at all opposed to the concept behind aspects, but I don't really want a game where they take over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408254/#Comment_408254" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T07:53:21+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  7:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As Rickard pointed out, you can get Wushu for free; some versions of FATE are available free here: <a href="http://www.faterpg.com/resources/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.faterpg.com/resources/</a>; a Creative Commons version of Mist-Robed Gate is available here: <a href="http://summerbird.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/mist-robed-gate-pdf/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://summerbird.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/mist-robed-gate-pdf/</a>. </blockquote>Thanks. <br/><br/>I don't think Mist Robed Gate is for me at all.

It's not my job to make his system work for him. I have no idea what ebb and flow means in regard to this new system The OP keeps saying RPGs are not good at X, but hasn't really had experience with a number of RPGs that focus on action. Those approaches are going to differ from his, which is a good thing. If they were the same, there'd be no need for a new game.

How do you make someone spin out of control with wire-fu and then use that to give yourself an advantage against the next attacker in Vampire? </blockquote>\nYou don't need advantage rules to create a wuxia game, but to answer your question: you just do what you do in your example, but with the Vampire system: you roll, you look at the result and you describe the action based on both the result and the genre. I couldn't tell anything wuxia <i>in the FATE system</i> from your example; it was all made up by the participants when they adjusted their descriptions (and the making of aspects) to the genre.

But it also codifies those bits of description so we know when the dude is knocked spinning, that can be used by folks at the table (either for free or by spending a fate point) for. +2 or a reroll. We know whether its a boost that will disappear immediately or an aspect that will last the scene. And we know that the description, if invoked, will have to be reincorporated into the fiction, creating more wuxia goodness in the narrative each time. Thats system and narrative interacting and supporting each other to create an experience. It's more than just describing stuff.<br/><br/>Sure, fate is adaptable. I didn't claim otherwise.

Many of the assertions are ones I disagree with. A game doesn't need an initiative system at all. Apocalypse World and its variants do fine without it. You may not be able to see a way to avoid having to roll for every mook, but a game like Fate handles mooks with limited processing time by combining them into groups and focusing attention on only the mook fights that are actually interesting and skipping over the tedium. Heck there's a big assumption that the game has to handle a horde of mooks with the same mechanic that is used in a duel. Burning Wheel has an intricate Fight! mechanic for knock down drag outs, but fighting through a horde of mooks to get to the launch computer in time could be a simple versus test.\n<blockquote>Player 1: I fight my way through the mooks and stop him before he puts in the last sequence of the launch code!<br/>GM: okay, there's what a dozen dudes between you and the control room. Roll your Kung Fu skill, the mooks are rolling Axe with +2 helping dice as they swarm all over you. On Success, you bust into the room just in the knock of time.

So if you have Ai, Bo, and Cong fighting, first Bo and Cong attack Ai, then Ai and Cong attack Bo, then Ai and Bo attack Cong. Everyone rolls off, if the attackers roll high then they do some hits, and if the defender rolls really high then the defender does some hits.

If I dive deeper into this, I would narrow that statement down to "descriptions are the most important part in roleplaying games". Without describing the environment, events, characters and creatures the whole game comes to a stop. As a game writer, you can give pointers that the participants will take into consideration when they describe things. A setting or a genre with it's tropes are nothing more than pointers. Structures for the story, the groups gaming style or a philosophical question are other examples of pointers.<br/><br/>Rules are no exceptions to this. What they do is giving pointers on how to describe; on how to play the game. So if you want the rules to make the players feel it's like wuxia, the rules should point towards that. There are probably endless possibilities to achieve that, and if you want examples I can give you that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete" title="dr_pete"><img alt="dr_pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete">dr_pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408455/#Comment_408455" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T06:03:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  6:03AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious what all the back and forth rolls are supposed to look like and what is going to make them interesting.

Forcing players to make rolls for otherwise simple actions is flawed.</blockquote>\nRole-playing games usually force players to make rolls for otherwise simple actions. One example is killing someone. Killing someone is really easy. You point the shotgun and you pull the trigger. You thrust with the spear. You push them off the roof. You hit them with your car. All of these actions require about as much skill and effort as shutting a window\u2014less, really, given that some windows are really complicated and have locks or cranks or screens that make it confusing, at least compared to the simple act of killing someone.<br/><br/>But the problem with killing someone isn't that it's an easy or hard task in and of itself. It's that someone is trying to stop you from killing that person. Sometimes it's that person. Sometimes it's someone else. Now all of a sudden what was once a really simple action becomes complicated, because someone is trying to stop you. So what was going to be a statement\u2014"I shoot the president"\u2014becomes a question\u2014"do I shoot the president, or do you stop me?"\u2014because what happens is now uncertain.<br/><br/>Sometimes the answer to the question is obvious. If we've determined in the game that I've already gotten up close to the president, and you're halfway across the room, it's not believable that you'd be able to get across the room to stop me. If the president is surrounded by a crowd of people and I'm way at the back, unable even to see him, I probably won't get a shot off. In the former case, no one rolls: the president just dies. In the latter case, no one rolls: I don't even get to shoot. Why? Because the fictional circumstances have already decided the question for us.<br/><br/>In other cases the answer to the question is less clear\u2014for example, if it's you and me and the president in a small room. Now, in spite of how simple or complicated the actions involved might be, there are chances for multiple outcomes. To decide those outcomes, we roll dice, or draw cards, or have a dance-off, or something. What dice we roll or how many cards we draw or which kind of dance we do, in role-playing games, is often determined by numbers and letters on a character sheet.<br/><br/>You have pointed out that games don't have skills for simple actions like closing windows. That's cool, we can still roll for it, at least in most traditional games. Just like how a simple action like killing someone is now complicated and uncertain because someone opposes it, the simple action of closing a window is now complicated and uncertain because someone opposes it.<br/><br/>So what do we roll to close that window? If we're playing World of Darkness we might roll opposed Strength checks, or opposed Dexterity checks, or opposed Strength + Dexterity checks, to see who can get to the window first or who can hold it open or shut. We might roll some fighting skills to see if one of us can hit the other and stun them for long enough that we can close the window unopposed. Honestly I don't even know, because I don't know what game we're playing in which we're shutting windows. I can think of ten games off the top of my head which don't even <i>have</i> skills. The version of D&amp;D 5th Edition which I played, back in the early playtests, made every non-combat action an ability score roll; you could have "skills" but they just modified your die roll. So since there is no window-closing skill, like you say, it would just have been a STR or DEX roll.<br/><br/><b>tl;dr</b> Simple actions are no longer simple when someone's trying to stop you.

Nowhere in that example does it say the person trying to get out of the window is tussling with the person trying to close it, just that he wants to leap out the window before he's shot, so he hasn't the time to fight. The point is being missed.<br/><br/>It is also not accurate to say that each time you want to kill another character you are entering into an opposed situation. Here's another example:<br/><br/>Batman is hiding on the rooftops and he see's the Joker holding the gun to the back of the head of a bound cop. The gun is pointing to the back of the guy's head and the cop is not resisting (he can't, fo the sake of argument, hence he's bound). The Joker has his back to the shadows and doesn't know Batman is there. Batman has to stop the Joker and disarm him before he can, and he will, fire.

Everytime a roll is made it means initiative is recalculated, which slows things down immeasurably instead of, for example, a single roll on the outset of combat. it also means more work for the GM at least up front and won't be any quicker than a basic initiative roll, even though conceptually it sounds better. <br/>It sounds like a great idea, but in practice the GM is going to have to process not only the players rolls, but also make rolls and decide what each NPC is doing in response all at once. Then he'll need to make a note of this order (or remember it) all before anything gets resolved. I don't see that being a more efficient system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408497/#Comment_408497" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T11:42:53+00:00" title="March  8, 2013 11:42AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2013 11:43AM by Lula.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This discussion has been warped; I used the example above and it has been twisted.

The gun is pointing to the back of the guy's head and the cop is not resisting (he can't, fo the sake of argument, hence he's bound). The Joker has his back to the shadows and doesn't know Batman is there. Batman has to stop the Joker and disarm him before he can, and he will, fire. The Joker needs only one action to shoot and Batman needs only one action to leap across and hit the Joker. Who goes first?</blockquote>\nIn your other posts you keep talking about initiative and actions and skills and stuff, which are subsystems which most of the RPGs I\u2019ve played don\u2019t even have. Are you talking about the w\u01d4xi\xe1 game you\u2019re making up? Or about a specific game? Either way, here\u2019s the answer to the Batman/Joker question in, like, every RPG I\u2019ve ever played:<br/><br/><b>3:16 Carnage Among the Stars</b> Batman and the Joker each roll Fighting Ability. Whoever rolls higher while still succeeding gets what they want.<br/><br/><b>1001 Nights</b> Roll a die\u2014any die; evens, Batman gets what he wants, odds, Joker gets what he wants.<br/><br/><b>Apocalypse World</b> Batman rolls Go Aggro. If he succeeds, he stops the Joker; if not, the Joker shoots the cop.<br/><br/><b>Dungeon World</b> Batman rolls Defend. If he succeeds, he stops the Joker; if not, the Joker shoots the cop.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts</b> Batman rolls Intervene Against an Act of Violence. If he succeeds, he stops the Joker; if not, the Joker shoots the cop.<br/><br/><b>Becoming Heroes</b> Batman and the Joker each narrate a shitton of traits to determine their dice pools, then roll off and whoever scores higher gets what they want.<br/><br/><b>Burning Wheel</b> Opposed Speed test. Joker gets +1D advantage for only having to pull a trigger instead of having to leap across a thing.<br/><br/><b>Contenders</b> The Joker doesn\u2019t get to fire because in this game we want to have boxing matches, and we\u2019ll just narrate whatever it takes to get us a boxing match. So Batman disarms the Joker and then they punch each other repeatedly for 45 minutes and it\u2019s awesome.<br/><br/><b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> Roll initiative, whoever goes first gets a chance to do their thing.<br/><br/><b>Everything is Dolphins</b> See D&amp;D above.<br/><br/><b>Exalted</b> Batman and the Joker both roll Join Battle. If Batman rolls higher he gets to try to disarm the Joker. If the Joker rolls higher he shoots the cop.<br/><br/><b>FATE</b> Batman rolls Athletics. If he gets a Superb +5 result, he gets a chance to disarm the Joker.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> Whoever is designated as resolving the situation gets to decide what happens.<br/><br/><b>Fight! The Fighting Game RPG</b> Opposed Athletics or Acrobatics or whatever.<br/><br/><b>FreeMarket</b> Draw some cards from the little fancy deck.<br/><br/>I need to hit up the library but I\u2019ll come back to explain how to do it in the other 50% of the RPGs I\u2019ve played later on. Also, what w\u01d4xi\xe1 works are you basing this system on?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408499/#Comment_408499" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T11:55:24+00:00" title="March  8, 2013 11:55AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you are thinking to much in terms of skill checks or tests against traits, that's not what we're talking about here.<br/><br/>Look at that scene with Batman and the Joker what are the possible outcomes?  Either Batman stops the Joker or he doesnt.  Have a contested roll whoever gets higher wins.  Now you can add modifiers to the rolls if you feel it's appropriate like +1 for Batman hidden in shadows or + to the Joker for his finger on the trigger whatever, whoever gets the highest roll determines how the scene turns out.<br/><br/>Essentially what we are talking about is not rolling to determine if someone succeeds or fails at a particular action but how the whole conflict is resolved in the scene.    Does the Joker kill the hostage before Batman can save him, we roll to determine that and can then narrate how it happens.  We dont need to go through a process of rolling initiative, rolling to hit, rolling damage, etc.<br/><br/>If you want to do it more trait based you could do it the Apocalypse world way and roll to seize by force.  Only a single roll for Batman,  2d6 and add a modifier based on a trait, 6 or less Batman fails and the Joker kills the hostage, 7-9 you get a choice likely something like you can succeed but the hostage gets critically wounded, 10+ Batman out right succeeds.  Again no initiative roll but the situtation gets resolved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408500/#Comment_408500" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T12:11:06+00:00" title="March  8, 2013 12:11PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Any action that matters in Sorcerer would be rolled.

But, that said:<br/><br/>* In a traditional, roll-initiative-and-then-play-out-actions system, the disadvantage is that you have at least two steps (or more) to resolve a single exchange.<br/>* In a Sorcerer-style, simultaneous rolls determine-success-and-initiative, parsing the dice is a little slower, but there's only one roll to make instead of two or three (or however many).<br/><br/>I don't think one is categorically faster than the other. They sure do feel different in play, though. Try them both and see what you like better. Then move on to other approaches and try those, too. There are many, many different ways to do this stuff out there. (And only one of those many approaches uses the D&amp;D-style initiative roll and attack/defense rolls.)<br/><br/>(If people are sounding frustrated with this conversation, it's because it's a conversation that's been run to death about 6-10 years ago for a lot of the posters here. Seriously, go do some research on this topic in older conversations: you'll find tons of really useful stuff. Or, if you don't know where to look, start a new thread and ask people to point you to some interesting resources or old conversations: I'm sure someone will be happy to oblige. People are generally very helpful with stuff like that around here.)<br/><br/>(As for saying something isn't workable, I think people don't like hearing you say something's not a good idea when it sounds like you haven't tried it yourself, and they have -- very likely -- played games that use this method with great success for many years. It sounds like you're asking them for advice and then ignoring what they tell you, which never makes anyone happy.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408537/#Comment_408537" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T18:30:55+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  6:30PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey ghostwhistler, do you already have specific preferences for what kind of stuff gets die rolls here, or are you open to rolling or not rolling for whatever seems Wuxia action-appropriate?<br/><br/>Some of the suggestions people are giving you involve redefining what sort of thing gets rolled for.

What they do is giving pointers on how to describe; on how to play the game. So if you want the rules to make the players feel it's like wuxia, the rules should point towards that. There are probably endless possibilities to achieve that, and if you want examples I can give you that.</blockquote>\nPlease do so.</blockquote>\n<h5>EXAMPLE 1</h5>Five years ago, I created alternative Fu rules for <b>Feng Shui</b>. I wanted the player, like in fire wu movies from the 80's, to tell the name of their strike when they attacked. So I created a system where the player bought different schools and then combined ranks from different schools to create techniques.<br/><br/>The <i>Flaming Tiger Strike</i> school gave for example a bonus to damage where fire was flaming up when hitting the target. Each rank gave a different bonus. Flaming gave +2, Tiger gave +4 and Strike gave +6. <i>Silent Wood</i> had only two ranks where Silent created soundless attacks and Wood controlled things in the air. When attacking, the player combined rank 1 from one school with rank 2 from another school and rank 3 from a third school. So with the two described schools, the use could create Silent Tiger (silent attack with +4 damage) or Flaming Wood (something in the air that combusted into flames with a +2 damage). My thought was that the building and telling it's name could give a nice feeling to the game.\n<h5>EXAMPLE 2</h5>There are several ways of give pointers through the rules. If there's a fictive system where you roll 1d6 against a difficulty and the difficulty of 1 says "Jumping from one skyscape to another, punch through a wall, run on water", that really sets the tone of the game.\n<h5>EXAMPLE 3</h5>From the skill set below, give one skill two dice and three other skills one dice each.<br/><br/><i>Sword:</i> you use your sword and your scabbard to solve problems.<br/><i>Sneak:</i> in the shadows lures danger. Death in the night.<br/><i>Jump:</i> you can jump as many floors as the value of your skill.<br/><i>Fire:</i> the ability to create fire whenever you want.<br/><i>Run:</i> at 1, you can run on any surface like walls or water. At 2, you outrun a cannon ball.<br/><i>Strength:</i> to be able to use ridiculous oversized weapons, to punch someone through a wall or knock someone a floor up in the air.<br/><i>Apprentice:</i> hinders are sorted out by the relationship between the master and it's apprentice. At 1, you're the apprentice. At 2, you got an apprentice.<br/><br/>To roll, you may add the dice of two skills together and take them into consideration when describing the action. The skill with two dice is always dominant in how you achieve your goal, if it's used in the action.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>All these examples are pretty straightforward. It was just in the last example that there was a little interaction between the components. You could create a whole system that, when all the parts interact, creates an emergent feeling of something [wuxia], but it will take to much time and effort to explain how to achieve that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408551/#Comment_408551" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T05:54:48+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  5:54AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Hey ghostwhistler, do you already have specific preferences for what kind of stuff gets die rolls here, or are you open to rolling or not rolling for whatever seems Wuxia action-appropriate?<br/><br/>Some of the suggestions people are giving you involve redefining what sort of thing gets rolled for.

I agree, except for me who goes first is hardly at issue. Does the Joker see Batman when he makes his move? That's where the meat is. I mean, Batman's going to disarm the Joker. But he's not faster than the Joker's trigger finger. If the Joker sees Batman jump from the shadows or throw his batamarang, the cop's going to die. <br/><br/>Unless the whole thing is part of the Joker's nefarious plot to capture the Bat.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408584/#Comment_408584" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T16:36:30+00:00" title="March  9, 2013  4:36PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noclue, <br/><br/>That depends on whether your arguing for a stealth roll instead initiative (in which case I simply suggest having a game system where the group negotiates on which type of roll to make (if they need to negotiate at all) and then votes on which one to use), or taking us right back to 'we have this fictional scenario and...how do we resolve it'?<br/><br/>Let's imagine it that A: The system lets any player call out that they think a dice roll (of some kind - initiative or stealth or whatever) aught to be involved and B: indeed in the batman example someone goes 'we need a roll!'.<br/><br/>I think in that case, apart from figuring the type of roll, it's pretty straight forward.<br/><br/>If we don't have that, then we get paralised by authority issues that Ron Edwards would no doubt like to go on about - ie, Ghostwhistler describes this scenario happening, he implies it needs to be resolved somehow but he doesn't like any of the answers - ie, were stuck in murk, because do we even need to resolve this situation? Is anyone gunna cry if someone at the table says 'and then batman sweeps in and saves the cop!'? (if someone will be upset, then have the 'if a player calls for a roll, a roll must be made' rule).

Joker's about to shoot a helpless guy, Batman wants to interfere.<br/><br/>When figuring out mechanical options, here's the first thing I'd ask: what do we care about?<br/><br/>Although it's technically accurate to say "who goes first?", we only care about that as a step or mechanism toward what we <i>really</i> care about.  And that is, "Can Batman prevent the murder?"<br/><br/>Given that we care about Batman's success or failure in preventing the murder, we can now move on and answer "What factors into determining that?"  Again, an obvious answer is "Who goes first?"  But that's not the only possibility.  Depending on the style of gameplay and the type of fiction you want, there are tons of other options.  I'll list 3 below.  If they all sound inappropriate to you, cool, that's an important stylistic choice you're making.  That said, these all do work in games with different styles.<br/><br/><b>1. Who's more determined?</b>  This is now a game that views the conflict through the lens of psychology.  <br/><br/>Is the Joker able to focus on the task at hand, or does his sweaty finger slip off the gun's safety as he hears footsteps on the roof above, knowing that a muscular dude is about to come hurtling down onto him?<br/><br/>Is Batman able to make himself a more tempting target, leaping into the light where the Joker can get a good shot at him, subverting the Joker's intention to shoot his prisoner by giving him something he wants more?<br/><br/><b>2. Who's more intimately involved?</b>  This is now a game that views the conflict through the lens of relationships.<br/><br/>Is the Joker moving extra quickly because he's fired up by the adrenaline of showing up his arch-nemesis?  Is he performing better, or worse, than he would be if he were facing down mere policemen?  <br/><br/>Is he killing this prisoner to protect his organization from an incursion by the Penguin, who he disdains with a passion, causing his hands to tremble with rage?<br/><br/>Is the prisoner Batman's new best friend, causing him to panic at the prospect of their loss, and botch the coordination for an early leap?<br/><br/><b>3. Who has more points?</b>  This is now a resource-management game.<br/><br/>Has Batman's player been spending turns gathering victory points that they can use to win conflicts?  Maybe they do this by losing earlier conflicts, emulating the arc of stories where the hero takes some losses before rallying to win.<br/><br/>Has the GM been spending his Joker budget on various crimes and capers, or have they been saving it for this showdown?<br/><br/>My point here is that we don't <i>have</i> to worry about how someone's speed or strength either helps them close a window or doesn't help them (because anyone can close a window).  Because what we <i>really</i> care about is whether the protagonist escapes.  And to determine <i>that</i> we have tons of options.  I am no Wuxia expert, but I might be more interested in a Wuxia game about determination, relationships, and strategic crafting of story arcs, as opposed to a Wuxia game about who's stronger or faster or goes first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408617/#Comment_408617" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T00:20:49+00:00" title="March 10, 2013 12:20AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2013 12:27AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Duplicate post deleted.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408621/#Comment_408621" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T00:59:45+00:00" title="March 10, 2013 12:59AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Are you interested in designing a game where any of the above answers would be "no"?

It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with that.<br/><br/>Should the dice mechanics take into consideration only the character's capabilities, the capabilities of their opponents and other factors in the environment, or can they take into account other priorities?<br/><br/>Should the dice mechanics only resolve a particular task a character attempts or can it resolve an entire conflict from start to finish?

When we play a game it's people sitting around the table, so part of the foundation is determining things like whose job it is to do what, how far can players decide things other than the actions of their characters and so on.  I do have one more question:<br/><br/>Is the game <i>about wuxia</i>, or are you going for a wuxia flavoured game?  For example if you identified something about the wuxia genre but found you would have to change one of the answers to the four questions I asked you from "yes" to "no" in order to get that to appear in actual play, would you?  Or is what you are going for here a combat system that has a Wuxia feel even if the rest of play doesn't necessarily have to (based on how the GM runs things, I guess)? <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408680/#Comment_408680" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T18:29:39+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  6:29PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2013 8:13PM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So starting again with the first post:\n<blockquote>No real need, beyond establishing who goes first (which might be represented with a simple bonus to A's initial roll), for regimented initiative/turn based systems. This even applies to gunfights: you get the ebb and flow there too, like in a John Woo movie, blam blam!</blockquote>\nI think this is how volleyball is scored.  You can only score a point when your side is serving the ball.\n<blockquote>Problem is what if A attacks B, but B is intending not to duel A.</blockquote>\nDid you find the idea of B having another stat that he rolls instead of "fight" that is about stopping fighting something that might work?  Like maybe "escaping" if he wants to run away instead or "convincing" if he wants to talk instead?  But "convincing" means the player can use dice to control the actions of another character (forcing them to stop fighting).  Does that happen in Wuxia, people start fighting and one convinces the other to stop?  If so, how do you plan on modelling that in terms of stopping the duel?  Entirely free-form roleplay and then the GM decides when an NPC is convinced and only a player can decide when his character is convinced?\n<blockquote> This system is great for a straight duel, but if B is attacking C and C is attacking A, what happens? Does A automatically hit B who automatically hits C who hits A etc? Maybe?</blockquote>\nCan you find scenes like this in Wuxia?  Go watch them and see what happens when a third character gets involved in a fight between two others.  Does a band of relatively unimportant characters fight as one?  Or would a fight between Master Xaio and 10 bandits require A through J duels?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408690/#Comment_408690" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T20:48:44+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  8:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't really think it's appropriate to comment on any brevity within my answers.

A double-whammy, as it were.<br/><br/>I'm suggesting deliberately crafting a system where it's a worthwhile tradeoff, and therefore a difficult decision. Do you act and show your hand, or do you bide your time (hoping to make a better decision), handing over initiative to your opponent?<br/><br/>The only game I can think of that did something like this was the Riddle of Steel, where (unless I'm misremembering, I've never actually played RoS) each player secretly chooses a die ("attack" or "defend") and then plops it down on the table. This means it's possible two characters just stand off, staring at each other (which you could make significant and interesting, if you design the system right); one attacks the other; or they both attack simultaneously, potentially running each other through.<br/><br/>There's some fairly unexplored territory here, I feel, which would be fun to consider.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408730/#Comment_408730" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T08:45:26+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  8:45AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem I find with the traditional approach to gaming is that what ends up happening ususally isnt all that unexpected.  Take the Joker vs. Batman example.  They both roll for initiative if Batman wins he'll get to attack and try to stop the Joker if he fails the GM gets to decide what the Joker does.  I tend to expect that the Joker will launch into a rant rather than kill the guard giving Batman another chance to act.   So Batman does act, if he's successful he stops the Joker from killing the hostage if he fails the GM gets to decide again what the Joker does, I'd expect he'd swing around and use the hostage as a shield while firing off a bullet at Batman.  The game tends to progress and turn out as the GM has planned out ahead of time (even subconiouscly) and we get less unexpected results.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408735/#Comment_408735" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T10:28:28+00:00" title="March 11, 2013 10:28AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vernon,<br/><br/>That's been my experience, as well.

politics might include overcoming challenges, leveling up/gaining XP, immersion, hanging out with friends, and a variety of other elements that might happen during a traditional RPG session regardless of the genre of the game.<br/><br/>Basically knowing whether or not the game is about wuxia or just includes wuxia elements can form a mission statement for the design so that when a given element is producing play that is not about wuxia you know whether or not to ditch it.  Or if being about wuxia gets in the way of the traditional RPG setup, and that's the priority, you know to ditch the wuxia element in favor of the traditional play.<br/><br/>A good example of this is whether or not you'd make decisions when designing mechanics based on the capabilities of the character vs the genre expectations of wuxia.  For example, I bet there's a lot of commonalities in the deaths of characters (not extras mind you) from one wuxia flim to the next.  If the game is about wuxia and the mechanics have a character die in a way that doesn't fit the genre, you'd change how character death was handled.  But if you have a HP/hit/injury and healing system that tracks damage to the character and the game was not primarily about being wuxia, you might keep that even if it produces results that are nothing like how characters die in wuxia.<br/><br/>So what does it look like when a third character enters into the fight with two other characters already fighting in wuxia?  Or, if the game is not about wuxia but just about having a degree of wuxia inspiration/feel, then you'd probably not need to refer to the films themselves to see what the genre expectations are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408860/#Comment_408860" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T16:56:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  4:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I wouldn't design an rpg system like that, it would be tedious.

Heck, I guess someone could even take a bonus instead if they're willing to risk waiting until later.<br/><br/>The penalty/bonus applies to all of their rolls in that round, so if defensive rolls are involved, they get that modifier as well.<br/><br/>Example: PC A takes a -30% penalty and PC B takes a -20% penalty. PC A attacks first and manages to hit PC B despite that. if the system has a defensive roll, say for blocking, that always comes up, they have a -20% to that roll. If they can still act after that attack is determined, whatever else they do still also has that -20% penalty. If later on PC C attacks PC B, the -20% penalty applies to that as well.<br/><br/>I don't now how you work out ties. You'll need to figure that out, and also the limits on how high the penalties and bonuses go.<br/><br/>For real ease, don't even bother to ask them to pre-declare what they want to do. Just let them act in order from worst penalty to highest bonus. The results of the rolls and damage and so on will inherently limit what later acting characters can do.<br/><br/>Would something like that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409086/#Comment_409086" name="Item_160" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T07:58:42+00:00" title="March 15, 2013  7:58AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2013 8:01AM by frozenwastes.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>1. most characters die in wuxia films from being attacked and killed.

It leaves me thinking that either you are here to troll or that you really do think characters are killed by the fictional events surrounding them in a given movie and you can't see larger structural causes or commonalities across films within the same genre.

I'm not really sure what you mean here.<br/>2. there is no one answer. It all depends on the film. </blockquote>\nI find your answer to 1. very troubling.  It leaves me thinking that either you are here to troll or that you really do think characters are killed by the fictional events surrounding them in a given movie and you can't see larger structural causes or commonalities across films within the same genre.  Your second point (2.) seems to support this.<br/><br/>Either way, I'm going to bow out of this thread.  If it was a big troll, you have my compliments on the execution.  If it's not and you honestly do want the best game play possible out of your game, I'd suggest reading up on things like genre and its expectations and conventions as well as taking the time to play the many, many games suggested in this thread.<br/></blockquote>\nThe characters in wuxia films die because they are killed by enemies/protagonists. Li Mu Bai dies because he's hit by poison darts. Sky dies because Nameless kills him. These are movies dominated by action and martial arts fights. People that die don't do so because they got hit by buses, caught cancer, or died of old age. You asked me how people get killed when the answer you were in fact looking for is that the scriptwriter killed them. That's disingenuous. There are common themes in the wuxia, simple themes of honour, martial prowess and tradition. You didn't ask me what those themes were and they are not really relevant here. Also a game system that seeks to strictly and specifically emulate these is not one that interests me. Games like that don't really work, they are forced and seem contrived. A game like Qin Warring States works because it's simple and thematic. Not because it has combat rules that say, as a blind off the cuff example, "nameless can't die until he's attacked the king".<br/><br/>There is no simple answer to how fights are handled. If there were, all these films would be carbon copies. It entirely depends on the circumstance. One person might join in and backstab the opponent, another might join in and be parried from behind by that opponent without even looking.<br/><br/>If you want to assume people are trolls because you don't agree with them, which is exactly what you are doing, then you should have followed my earlier advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409131/#Comment_409131" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-15T11:48:02+00:00" title="March 15, 2013 11:48AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ghostwhistler,<br/><br/>Most of these suggestions and examples being thrown out <i>are</i> from traditional systems.<br/><br/>Anyway, given that you've rejected most of the approaches suggested so far, I think your best next course of action is to respond to my last message (above).

Mu Bai dies because he's hit by poisoned darts while <i>shielding his friends and protege from them with his sword.</i> <br/><br/>Mu Bai avoids nasty death hundreds of times. The reason he dies when he dies is to bring the themes and questions of his character to resolution. Those aren't just random poison darts from some random assailant. They're the embodiment of the poison that started when Jade Fox was rejected, that led to Mu Bai's master's death, that dragged Mu Bai half way back into the life, that led to Jen's suicide attempt, and that would have killed the people Mu Bai cares about.<br/><br/>So the question is a good one. Is this a game where Mu Bai just dies cause he's hit by some darts?

For the player, the assumption is that they chose to have the ability to sacrifice the character for some great goal, which would mean that the player was hoping that the game would come down to this choice between the character and the thing. A game with an ability like that included in character creation is primed for this moment and if the game has done its job the choice the character makes at that time is poignant.\n<blockquote>What you could perhaps do is adapt what I'm given to believe happens in Tenra Banso 0, whereby you can take off the training wheels and become vulnerable to fatal injury as a character.

That's similar to "Bringing Down the Pain" in The Shadow of Yesterday, as well. It's a good way to differentiate between regular conflicts and those that the player wants to have heightened dramatic weight and tension, while leaving the distinction completely in the player's hands.

Essentially, it is Wuxia and space opera.\n<blockquote>-How much of the story would I have to prepare in advance? just the start or do I have to prepare at least a dozen places or possible situations and maybe three times that number of NPCs?

The GM writes an adventure/prepares a scenario in the traditional fashion. <br/>As much combat as you like bearing in mind that this is a game with action at its core as I would hope would be self evident from at least the wuxia inspiration.<br/>If players act like dicks then no ruleset can compensate. That's a GM call: either discuss it, kick the player out, or find a game that's more to the group's taste if that's what it takes. No game is liked or suitable for everyone. <br/>If you mean character's acting 'evil' then there are setting elements to endorse that. But, as with most games, if the pc's start tearing up the universe and destroying everything it won't end well no matter the rules. That's just being a dick again.<br/>Should you narrate dice results? If you like. I would like to think that people would describe their actions given that this intends to be traditional in that respect. How you do it is never something a designer should force.<br/>As few dice rolls as possible. <br/>I don't know. I don't care for processing lots of bonuses anyway, I'm not interested in math. I would rather reduce everything to as simple a process as possible: roll vs difficulty level. If bonuses are present (and they may be unavouidable or necessary in certain cases) then i'd rather just represent that with a higher difficulty level.<br/>Don't roll for mundane actions where there isn't much of a threat or where failing would be a pain in the ass (ie can you brush your teeth? let's roll!).

And don't worry about giving too much information\u2014actually all of this is crucial stuff.<br/><br/>In terms of adventure/scenario prep, I think what WarriorMonk means is (correct me if I'm wrong, my friend!): is the outcome of the adventure pre-determined? Like if there's a Big Bad Guy does he <i>have</i> to die, or might he survive if the PCs roll poorly or use bad tactics or something like that? And I don't really know what you mean by "the traditional manner" to prepare an adventure. Even sticking within the sphere of completely traditional games, there are innumerable schools of thought on how GMs should prepare to run.<br/><br/>For example, prep might be:<br/>-primarily a map, with some notes on what creatures live where on the map<br/>-primarily a list of NPCs with their stats and interrelationships<br/>-primarily a list of plot events, and the order in which they need to happen for the adventure to stay "on track"<br/><br/>By the way, there aren't really any "wrong" answers to the questions we're asking you\u2014it's your game, after all. But they are questions that *have* to be answered one way or another. Even "this is an issue which each group needs to customize to taste" is fine\u2014but that's still a design decision, and should be called out as such in your rules text.<br/><br/>For instance, <a href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">@ghostwhistler</a>, you seem to feel that way about narration rights after dice rolls\u2014maybe the GM talks, maybe the player talks, maybe it depends on whether the player succeeded or failed on the roll. But I've played with a *lot* of groups, and even just considering the more traditional end of things, there has been an enormously wide variance on what is considered normal regarding that issue. Yet, it's something that makes a truly profound difference at the table\u2014moreso than anything mathematical!<br/><br/>I think you're right on the money regarding dickish behavior, but remember that simply playing to win or trying to play well <i>within the rules framework</i> isn't being a dick. Like if we're playing Pathfinder and I'm playing a Fighter I'm going to find the best way to optimize by damage output because *that's my job*. I won't cheat, of course\u2014if I roll poorly in a particular combat then tough shit, you know? But if I start attacking fellow PCs or townsfolk for no reason, then yeah, I'm with you, that's a problem that has nothing to do with the game.<br/><br/>So I think WarriorMonk is asking, how *much* "gaming of the system" is allowed and/or how does that work?<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409501/#Comment_409501" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T15:41:47+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  3:41PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2013 3:42PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your answers, Ghostwhistler. Based on those and some of the stuff I've been reading in the thread, the idea I have for your original inquiry\n<blockquote><br/>Problem is what if A attacks B, but B is intending not to duel A. This system is great for a straight duel, but if B is attacking C and C is attacking A, what happens? Does A automatically hit B who automatically hits C who hits A etc? Maybe?</blockquote>\nwould be: Have A, B &amp; C roll at once.

A is fighting them both off!<br/><br/>Example 2<br/><br/>A: 8<br/>B: 10<br/>C: 6<br/><br/>B defends successfully against A, and will attack in the next exchange (i.e. won initiative). A defends successfully against C, and C is now on the defensive. In the next exchange, A could hurt C and B could hurt A.<br/><br/>Example 3<br/><br/>A: 6<br/>B: 10<br/>C: 8<br/><br/>B defends successfully against A, and will attack in the next exchange. C hits or kills A.  If A is still alive, s/he is in serious trouble next turn!</blockquote>\nThe only remaining design problem is "What do you do when the initiative isn't established yet?" For example, if, in the second example, B decides to attack C instead of A.<br/><br/>You want to keep it simple. How about this:<br/><br/>* They're both considered to have the initiative against each other (so both roll, and higher roll hits).<br/>* If the circumstances seem unexpected, an attacker wins initiative automatically (like if you suddenly attack an ally or you get the jump on somebody). Choosing to attack someone first qualifies: you have the initiative by default.<br/><br/>To make it just a little more interesting, I would build in a little bit more complexity. For example...\n<blockquote>When you roll higher than your opponent, see how many points you beat them by:<br/><br/>If you beat their roll by 5 or more, the opponent is defeated, at your mercy (and dead, if you choose to finish them off).<br/><br/>If you beat their roll, but not by 5, they must choose one:<br/><br/>* They suffer a wound, and lose a hit point (or a similar resource)<br/>* They must give ground to you, ceding their position (maybe falling off something, or on their back)<br/>* They are disarmed, losing a weapon they are currently using<br/></blockquote>\nAnd certain positions give you a bonus to your roll (you have the high ground!).<br/><br/>That seems like it fulfills the criteria set out so far. What do you think?<br/><br/>(If you disagree, I'll ask you once again to look at my previous posts: I asked you some very important questions in terms of resolving this.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409563/#Comment_409563" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T06:24:50+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  6:24AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>In terms of adventure/scenario prep, I think what WarriorMonk means is (correct me if I'm wrong, my friend!): is the outcome of the adventure pre-determined? <br/></blockquote>\n<i>The </i>adventure?

If you absolutely need to know who goes first at anything, then you need a way to measure character's speed of reaction. If that isn't already a stat in your game which can be used for simple comparisions to decide, you can either add such an stat or a similar one... or roll the dice to see who goes first. And again, let me clarify: ONLY if absolutely necessary to find out who goes first, not in every single scene, action or encounter.<br/><br/>Which by the way, would be another way to say that everybody here on the forum was most about right about that silly window example: the roll in that case isn't meant to define if the player closes the window succesfully (it's obvious he can!), but instead to determine who goes first. Again, not that you need to apply this to every single scene, action or encounter, but only when it really counts for something.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409600/#Comment_409600" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T13:01:24+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  1:01PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Errr, I'm not really clear on how it's not relevant.

But this game might be for advanced role-players only.</blockquote>\nTo be quite honest I don't really know why you are even asking me about those things in the first place. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409610/#Comment_409610" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T13:59:26+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  1:59PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, man.

If you absolutely need to know who goes first at anything, then you need a way to measure character's speed of reaction. If that isn't already a stat in your game which can be used for simple comparisions to decide, you can either add such an stat or a similar one... or roll the dice to see who goes first. And again, let me clarify: ONLY if absolutely necessary to find out who goes first, not in every single scene, action or encounter.<br/><br/>Which by the way, would be another way to say that everybody here on the forum was most about right about that silly window example: the roll in that case isn't meant to define if the player closes the window succesfully (it's obvious he can!), but instead to determine who goes first. Again, not that you need to apply this to every single scene, action or encounter, but only when it really counts for something.<br/></blockquote>\nSorry about quoting myself but it seems my post got lost in the ton of sarcasm raining and I just wanted to know if this was any useful to you Ghostwhistler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18064%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18064%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Trying To Model Combat - Page 5 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p5" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Trying To Model Combat - Page 5" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18064/trying-to-model-combat/p5" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Huh, first time I peeked into a design thread in ages.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, first time I peeked into a design thread in ages. Anyway:<br/><br/>=====<br/>Problem is what if A attacks B, but B is intending not to duel A. This system is great for a straight duel, but if B is attacking C and C is attacking A, what happens? Does A automatically hit B who automatically hits C who hits A etc? Maybe?<br/>=====<br/>Wuxia, eh? Everyone rolls all the time. A will *try to hit* B who will *try to hit* C who will *try to hit* A. Perhaps the attacker get a one-time bonus for an unexpected action, but I wouldn't call it automatic. Every wuxia master in all wuxia media is "on" all the time. Even a sneak attack, the master would feel the \u6bba\u6c17/killing intent (the flames from the candles from HERO, but most wuxia masters don't need candles). So just give the attacker a bonus in the situation, perhaps a small one, but not an auto.<br/><br/>Then resolve normally: A and B roll, loser gets hurt; B and C roll, loser gets hurt; C and A roll, loser gets hurt.<br/>Don't apply the results (hurt penalties) in that order.<br/>Perhaps create a simple stat called "initiative" that you don't roll, it's a number from like 1 (normal humans) to 20 (god master strike king) that you can raise over time through levelling which, much like combat-centric card games, determines which order damage is applied in group combats. <br/>A has Initiative of 3<br/>B has Initiative of 4<br/>C has Initiative of 9 (super fast kung fu, not necessarily god-level, but super fast).<br/><br/>A surprises (gets a bonus on) B, and B takes damage<br/>B surprises C, but B takes damage<br/>C surprises A, and A takes damage.<br/><br/>Damage effects that may hinder kung fu rolls are not applied yet. The wuxia will feel the damage momentarily.<br/><br/>You pile up "hit tokens" or something. Then apply them.<br/>C does damage to B<br/>C does damage to A<br/>B doesn't hit anyone.<br/>A does damage to B<br/><br/>Now, what about the same situation later in the fight, where C and A have one hit left, and B has two hits left. You roll in the exact same way.<br/><br/>C does damage to B - B takes one hit.<br/>C does damage to A - A takes one hit, and falls.<br/>B doesn't hit anyone.<br/>A does damage to B - Ahhh, but A has already fallen. B takes no damage.<br/><br/>C and B remain standing, and since they are facing each other, they resort to normal dueling without using that initiative score.<br/><br/>Or, alternately, if there is a situation (based on some rules-exclusion feat) that lets both opponents damage each other ("Once per day, do a damage when taking a hit"), resolve the hits in order of that initiative number.<br/><br/>DONE.<br/><br/>Or, as JD Says:<br/><br/>=============== THREAD ENDS HERE =================                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409673/#Comment_409673" name="Item_202" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T06:35:18+00:00" title="March 20, 2013  6:35AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If the action requires no dice roll, no dice is rolled. </blockquote>Right, but how do you determine when someone acts.

All characters should have a number to indicate this. Whenever you need to know who goes first, look up for this number. Character with the higher Speed of Reaction goes first. Players should be able to improve this stat too with xp.<br/><br/>If you don't like this, then you can make players roll a dice to decide who goes first, but ONLY when it matters, not for every action, combat round or scene.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409722/#Comment_409722" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T10:10:25+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 10:10AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>If the action requires no dice roll, no dice is rolled. </blockquote>Right, but how do you determine when someone acts.

That example was used by me because it was suggested by someone else as an example of the results-as-initiative system, which I still don't care for (as i've already explained). The whole point of using that as an example is to ask precisely what I've asked, but your answer shifts the goalposts so you might as well just say the solution to that problem is to use a different system entirely. Isn't that rather defeating the point?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409724/#Comment_409724" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-20T10:15:50+00:00" title="March 20, 2013 10:15AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2013 10:16AM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ghostwhistler, does your game uses character stats of any kind?

Maybe with some advice to the GM to help decide, but sometimes just left to fiat.<br/><br/>b) Roll when you've touched on a specific part of the fiction. Like, if you're swinging a sword in the fiction, you use the combat system. If you're opening a window and there are no window-opening rules, you do not roll. <br/><br/>c) Roll when people don't agree on the outcome. If I swing my sword at you and you and I agree that it hits you in the neck, then we don't need to roll. If I say I am opening the window and you say you want to stop me and I don't want to be stopped, then we resolve it using the mechanics.<br/><br/>There are probably other general classes of solutions that I'm missing, but that's a good start, right?<br/><br/><br/>It may or may not be helpful to study what we call, <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=206" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IIEE</a>, which stands for Intent, Initiation, Execution, and Effect, or the four stages everyone goes through when they add to the shared fiction game-space. Dice and mechanics can get involved at any of those stages, and you as a designer choose where you put dice and other contact with the mechanics.<br/><br/>Let me know if you need me to explain or unpack anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410135/#Comment_410135" name="Item_220" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T14:32:21+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  2:32PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2013 2:32PM by WarriorMonk.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, trolling aside, a few posts before you wrote:\n<blockquote><blockquote>Ghostwhistler, does your game uses character stats of any kind?

It's a pretty traditional affair; Att + Skill + dice vs Difficulty or Opposing result. <br/><br/>Why do you ask?</blockquote>\nAnd then I wrote:\n<blockquote>Why not compare Martial attributes to decide who goes first (only when it matters who goes first)?<br/><br/>If there is still a tie, you can always roll the dice to decide who goes first.</blockquote>\nMostly because the Martial attribute seems to be an appropiate way to point how much "this character is better trained and so, must be faster than his opponents". If you don't feel like it, then it can be Wisdom because as you state it could also include reaction speed, since that one is also a matter of the mind. <br/><br/>Do you have any plausible reason not to use this to handle initiative?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410137/#Comment_410137" name="Item_221" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T14:42:07+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  2:42PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or to simply say whoever rolls highest (with their fighting roll) goes first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410195/#Comment_410195" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T01:54:23+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  1:54AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>DONE.<br/><br/>Or, as JD Says:<br/><br/>=============== THREAD ENDS HERE =================</blockquote>\nHow does TBZ resolve initiative?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410338/#Comment_410338" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T18:37:01+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  6:37PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't publish the rules here, but basically, dice-rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410351/#Comment_410351" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T00:47:18+00:00" title="March 25, 2013 12:47AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not asking for the rules to be published.

In TBZ you declare and resolve actions in descending order of Agility stats (swiftest characters go first), with two wrinkles:<br/><br/>You can spend resources to interrupt the current action and declare/resolve yours first (interruptions don't stack; the first person to spend the points and interrupt can't be interrupted, but after that action resolves, the actor who was interrupted can be interrupted again), or to take extra actions, which normally take place after all normal actions but can also be used to interrupt as above;<br/><br/>And every melee-range attack is an opposed roll, so if you attack someone and roll poorly you might be the one taking damage, effectively giving your target an extra action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410367/#Comment_410367" name="Item_226" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T06:58:59+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  6:58AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Joe_McGuffin said, my bad for misinterpretating the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410372/#Comment_410372" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T07:53:29+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  7:53AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the clarification.<br/><br/>Are there any easy ways/shortcuts to a tick/battle wheel system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410376/#Comment_410376" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T08:26:16+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  8:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2013 8:35AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks for the clarification.<br/><br/>Are there any easy ways/shortcuts to a tick/battle wheel system?</blockquote>\nYou don't really need one for TBZ-style initiative; the ongoing order of initiative doesn't actually change like in Feng Shui or Exalted, just occasional "I go early" or "I go again", prompted by players spending a finite resource to do so.   When I run a fight in TBZ, I just ask for everyone's Agility and write down their names in that order.  If someone jumps the queue, we resolve their exception and then go back to resolving in the standard order.  There's not really any long-term initiative bookkeeping outside of remembering if someone's already taken an action when their turn comes up.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410380/#Comment_410380" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T10:18:50+00:00" title="March 25, 2013 10:18AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm speaking generally here.

Unfortunately I won't be visiting rpg.net because I feel the moderation that happens there is far too heavy handed. I say unfortunate becauyse it's a popular site with a lot of decent contributors.
