So we decided to play 3:16 in the Warhammer 40K setting. <br/><br/>The reskin was light-touch. No rules were changed, just different names for gear and ranks. Combat drugs became the Grace of the Emperor. Stuff like that. Also added a couple of roles people could take that added an extra order to their list:<br/><br/>\u2022\tChaplain: defend the spiritual health of the squad<br/>\u2022\tLibrarian: keep the secrets of the chapter.<br/>\u2022\tApothecary: Sanctify the dead (remove the geneseed from fallen marines so it can be used to make more)<br/><br/>The mission was the final battle of an Imperial crusade against the Eldar. The Dark Angels space marines have to seize the city\u2019s God-Tower and hold it. We had a fun time. There was a charge across a sniper-watched square, a fight up an Eldar mausoleum to find high ground and locate a missing squad, a battle against possessed marines in a park of crystal trees, and a final assault on the God-Tower in a commandeered APC. More info on the in-game events can be found <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?p=12718096#post12718096" rel="nofollow">over here</a>.<br/><br/>An interesting thing happened at the end: one player pre-empted the final encounter by invoking a Strength. That left a bit of a bitter taste in some players\u2019 mouths, I think. Everyone else was geared up for a big fight, and hadn\u2019t quite clicked onto the semi-competitive nature of the play. At least one player is very wary of PVP elements in games, but 3:16\u2019s competitive element is quite\u2026mild? A poke in the ribs, not a stab in the gut. <br/><br/>Killing or totally inconveniencing another player is hugely dangerous to you, but ensuring they\u2019re operating a peak kills-efficiency doesn\u2019t help your chances of victory either. People tend to see weapons\u2019 kill stats as damage, but they\u2019re not. The number of kills you score has no bearing on whether you win the encounter. It\u2019s not your job to ensure everyone else is at optimal range, but you want them at a range that lets them remove a threat token.<br/><br/>I'm curious how serious player-vs-player conflict has got in other people's games of 3:16.<br/><br/>I\u2019m completely in love with the combat system. As soon as the dice are rolled at the start of a round, everyone at the table has absolute information on how the round will play out. That makes for fascinating tactical choices.<br/><br/><br/><b>Lessons learned</b><br/><br/>A key trick to GMing seems to be throwing concrete fictional details out there. We had a fight on a spiral staircase, a crystal forest, captured space marines controlled like puppets by elder that rode them, an abandoned APC. Tangible elements that the players can interact with and bounce off. Don\u2019t just leave the burden of narration to the players.<br/><br/>Oh, and NFA rolls, NFA rolls, NFA rolls. To get stuff working, to find stuff out, to get from one place to another. Throw them out like confetti. <br/><br/><br/><b>Stuff I need to do better next time</b><br/><br/>Pull back a bit from seizing the narration-reins. If a player seems at a loss I tend to jump in to help out, and sometimes do so a bit quickly or in too much detail. I\u2019ve also not yet been using superior officers as adversity. Need to have more of a think about this.<br/><br/>Anyone else got tips for ongoing 3:16 play? What should I know?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289109/#Comment_289109" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T05:14:32+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  5:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just run it like you would a campaign of 40K.

It's not.  I mean sure you could play it in a very light, video-game action/violence sort of way.  But all the tools for something "deeper" are there.  The game doesn't hit you in the face right away, but the themes do kinda creep up on you over the course of a few missions.  Then it essentially becomes all about conflict between the marines.  The missions themselves are just vehicles to drive the inter-human conflicts.<br/><br/>As for PVP conflicts, I wouldn't expect too many on the first couple of missions.  But if you, as the GM, put the players into situations that challenge their sense of humanity and pit one character against the other via NPC orders, then the PVP conflicts will come.  In my experience, they start out almost passive aggressive, and eventually erupt into all out murder.  You do have to give it some time.  Don't rush.  Just enjoy the missions at first.  Push the PCs' buttons and let the players drive when they want to start disobeying orders, etc.<br/><br/>The best part about 3:16 is figuring out <i>why</i> the players are going after one another or breaking away from the military hierarchy.  That's the good stuff after you get past the initial enthusiasm of: "Holy crap, I just killed 50 bugs on one roll!" -- which is still great fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289339/#Comment_289339" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T09:18:32+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  9:18AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>3:16 is a bear and pretzels game</blockquote>\nGregor, I have a new quote for your website.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289341/#Comment_289341" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-28T09:29:57+00:00" title="August 28, 2010  9:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>Gregor, I have a new quote for your website.</blockquote>\nNATHAN!  *shakes fist dramatically*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
