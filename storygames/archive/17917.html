Reginald doesn't really want to stay the Pennsington Heir, as his girlfriend, Sophronia (PC), would really rather not be Lady Pennsington.<br/><br/>Reginald: Did I get a chance to introduce you to Gregory?<br/><br/>Sophronia: You may have made a few gestures.<br/><br/>Reginald: So, no, not really.<br/><br/>Later:<br/><br/>Reginald: Gregory, did I have the opportunity to introduce you to Miss Wilkinson?<br/><br/>Gregory: You may have made a couple of gestures.<br/><br/>Alden, who plays Reginald: I want a New Aspect: They're All In Cahoots!<br/><br/>Sophronia: Pleased to meet you, Gregory. I... feel like I know you already.<br/><br/>The three of them talked about Alice (PC) who was a Martian in a previous life. Gregory used the term "metempsychosis", which was completely misheard.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Oh, you see I heard Madam Psychosis, and people call her all sorts of things back home...<br/><br/>Alice's player, Josh, said he'd also heard it as "Madam Psychosis". I explained that I'd learned the word from James Joyce's Ulysses, where Molly mishears it as "met him pike hosis". <br/><br/>Josh: So apparently the word exists to be misunderstood, which is awesome.<br/><br/>Nunzio, who plays Victor: I like Madam Psychosis.<br/><br/>GM: I thought that was your mother.<br/><br/>(Victor's mother was the head of an Evil Conspiracy, her end goal being to erase everyone's memory of the scandal that she felt deprived her of her rightful social position.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Victor and his fiance, Angelina, explored the various nooks and crannies -- of the floating island. They were also interested in some monsters from last session, Victor wondering about whether they excreted, and if so, how.<br/><br/>GM: So, Victor and Angelina are looking for monster poop on their date.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Of course they are. You guys are really cute<br/><br/>Eventually, folks reached Egypt.<br/><br/>Sophronia: What are we doing with our floating island while we are asking questions of the locals?<br/><br/>Reginald: Parking it in the river.<br/><br/>Sophronia: But it isn't the right time for the river to flood. Can't we just leave it floating?<br/><br/>Reginald: Well... we don't have to take the flying island _all_ the way to Alexandria. We could just park it at the peak of an inaccessible mountain.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Out of curiosity, do we know how to start it again once we part it?<br/><br/>Reginald: Well, we have the whole flight to Egypt to figure out how to park it.<br/><br/>Sophronia: How did we park it before?<br/><br/>Well, they'd just left someone on board to steer it in circles. I think they eventually figured out how to park it more elegantly. They decided to leave Deosa, an African woman they'd rescued who'd decided she wanted to see the world, and a male doctor on the island. Folks thought about leaving a chaperone, as they had one with him, a woman who was up on the latest fashions, as well as on the unspoken rules of when to pretend not to see something.<br/><br/>GM: But, Egyptian fashions!<br/><br/>Alice: No, that's true. Egyptian fashions are important!<br/><br/>So, the pair are unchaperoned. The doctor's shown himself as fairly moral, so the group figures the biggest danger is the woman seduces him. I think that if she wants to get into trouble, she's more likely to leave the island and go exploring on her own, but I'm not sure either will add anything to the upcoming session.<br/><br/>And, our heroes arrove!<br/><br/>Sophronia: Arrove -- that is the best past participle of arriving that I have heard.<br/><br/>Someone: He went arrovoing and then he arrove.<br/><br/>Nunzio's roommate (coming in to overhear some of this): I thought the Congo and Egypt were on different sides of Africa.<br/><br/>Nunzio: We have a floating island.<br/><br/>Roommate: I gotta get me one of those.<br/><br/>Someone: It moves at the speed of Plot +1.<br/><br/>GM: At the speed of Plot.<br/><br/>Someone: +1.<br/><br/>(repeat those last two lines a few times)<br/><br/>The PCs decided that Alice and her finace would pose as a ditzy English couple (not a very far stretch).<br/><br/>Angelina: I could be her bookish companion.<br/><br/>Sophronia: Then who am I?<br/><br/>Alice: My other bookish companion.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405757/#Comment_405757" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-08T12:29:52+00:00" title="February  8, 2013 12:29PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            THAT's a <i>BIG </i>bite....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405782/#Comment_405782" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-09T07:30:31+00:00" title="February  9, 2013  7:30AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monsterhearts<br/><br/>After having a crush on Gabriel the Chosen, my teenage werewolf girl Dakota finally decides, right before they charge into a mammoth church to fight the big bad, to just go ahead and kiss Gabriel, to show him how she felt.

As we fill out the Series Synopsis Sheet (MZ's version of the group template), we end up crafting a post-singularity collapse (but recovering) society where specific houses have genetic gifts and the players are hired for their mecha piloting skills to explore the newly reactivated jump gate network to see what happened to the rest of the universe following the collapse.  Looking forward to political machinations of the houses, a little drama between the crew (MZ's life path system is rife with romances and enemies), and exploration of worlds left behind by the "Hard Rapture".<br/><br/>I was told (after the fact) about a book called Newton's Wake and was stunned to discover the parallel developments in our world building session.

But the person on the spot has to swear a magical oath to deliver it to a particular person, to not open the satchel, and to not read the book. They get the book back to their digs and - after checking that the librarians' guild god is a "letter of the oath" sort of god, one of the other freebooters opens the satchel, after which they plan to take the book to their client and then deliver the satchel to the intended recipient. <br/><br/>Unfortunately they didn't think to check for explosive runes on the satchel's buckle. <br/><br/>The character had three hit points, the explosive rune did... rather more than that.

But I don't want to start my own AP thread.<br/><br/><i>Last night on Monsterhearts...</i><br/><br/>We ended with a bit of a cliffhanger previous session. Gail (fae) had taken Cage's (ghoul) doll-like sister for safe keeping back to his newly discovered fae family who live in a fae abandoned hospital. The characters tracked Gail and the sister down. The problem was, Gail wasn't allowed to let us in, it was the only rule his fae family had set down. But we needed to get Cage's sister, so we went in anyway. Cue crazy scenes in fae-land.<br/><br/>The fun part about this is that we were both playing two characters. (so far, whenever one character has NPCs in a gang, we all get to play one of the NPCs. The same was true of the faeries.) So the players were able to poke at the other player characters with the NPCs. Our group does this a bunch in various games, and it's pretty fun.<br/><br/>One of the fae is a Master Duellist. She challenges Cassidy (werewolf) to a duel of course (the most intimidating physical character there) and the two of them exchange some awful blows, the duellist wielding a silver sword. The duellist nearly dead, Cassidy uses her Mercy move, but the duellist fills up all four of the werewolf's harm regardless, pushing Cassidy into her darkest self. A raging blackfurred beast stalks the halls.<br/><br/>Another fae is a beautiful Princess. A romantic, she becomes obsessed with the "hero from the sea", our (selkie) Rowan. Rowan just wants to find Cage's sister, and says she looks like a doll, and so the Princess takes her to her dollhouse, where row after row of dolls with the faces of people Rowan knows at school are lined. The Princess proceeds to distract Rowan as much as possible, taking him to a ball, saying "just one more dance" to keep him distracted.<br/><br/>The third fae, a Barrow Wight, speaks to the dead, and so of course hones in on Cage (ghoul). They exchange witty remarks about how dead they both are, but the Barrow Wight pokes at Cage. He's searching for his sister, and when he turns to go the fae presents him with ten exits. "What do you really desire, in that empty shell you inhabit" the fae asks. Cage responds "I dunno, I guess, I don't know who I am". The fae tosses him a coin and says "Choose a direction."<br/><br/>Finally, Jackson (chosen) is confronted with a giant Snake fae. This fae just wants to eat him. Jackson fails an attack role, and jumps to the worst possible conclusion, Gail tricked them all into coming into the fae realm so they could all be destroyed. The snake bit him nearly to death, but in the end made Gail appear before them all. Jackson proceeds to attack Gail, thinking he's the enemy. The head of the household, a woman with a beehive hairdo, enters the scene and rolls out a contract before Gail. "I hate to do this, but you broke your promise." And Gail disappears (he retires his character).<br/><br/>All the characters are outside, but the action isn't over yet! Cassidy is still in her darkest self, and rips into Cage (it was funny, we all rolled for who of the PCs would be attacked, and everyone was so excited to get the highest number! So emo). She has a homebrewed power called Unrepentant Rage (or something I can't remember) where she can't help but do two damage when she lashes out physically. Cage flies across the graveyard, but Cassidy doesn't stop here (she doesn't care for Cage anymore!!) and the werewolf drooling and mad turns on Rowan. Rowan points at the moon saying "It's not even full Cassidy!" but Cassidy just sees his hand and jumps on him, ravaging his arm. Jackson stabs the werewolf, but it's Cages words the help sedate the beast. He calls her on her shit, saying "Cassidy this is bullshit, how you just lash out and hurt the people you care about. Get over yourself". The werewolf sees how much she hurt Cage and Rowan, and comes out of her rage, shaking and naked, and Rowan, with savaged arm, proceeds to _comfort her_.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the condition Cage gets for calling her on her shit is "heartless". The player takes this literally, and where Cage's heart used to be before the werewolf encounter is a hole. The other PCs proceed home with Cage's sister, but Cage stays to satiate his hunger. Cassidy proceeds to look for his heart in the ravine nearby, which leads to an uncomfortable sex scene with the two characters (because Cassidy can still satiate Cage's hunger, but she doesn't remember having sex with him). He's in his darkest self, but Cassidy's turned on, and she gives herself to him feeling pretty guilty about tearing his heart out when she was a werewolf. Sex moves are exchanged (Cassidy now has Cage back on her possessive list, Cassidy remains a way Cage can satiate his hunger). All kinds of angst. And what, these two can't escape each other.<br/><br/>The next day at school there's a new character Victoria (queen). She has a bad luck amulet that's causing all sorts of havok. Cage's "girlfriend" Jade meets up with him and wants to know if he got her sexts, he relents to a date with her. Cassidy and Rowan meet up after school in the drug van, wallow in misery, cigarettes, and vodka, and have misery hook up sex. They feel marginally better afterwards and sex moves are exchanged (Cassidy has Rowan and Cage on her possessive list now, and Rowan has strings on Cage). Jackson flirts with the new girl Victoria, and has a date lined up. Hope she doesn't notice his junk is missing (still stolen from the mermaid/man, still unresolved til next time!).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407299/#Comment_407299" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T23:09:44+00:00" title="February 25, 2013 11:09PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The real secret of the Order is that it doesn't exist to shield the magicians from the world, it exists to protect the ordinary world from them.<br/><br/>And it fails.
