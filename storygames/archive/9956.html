Pick 3-4 civilizations that you think provide an interesting tension and a nice range of options. If you want to bring in other stuff, you can introduce it a little at a time. The fact that everyone's working for the Patent Office means that characters can quit or get reassigned to other teams without much trouble, so people can bring in new characters from the new civs if they like.<br/><br/>When I run this at conventions, I often either have pregens or use the quickstart character creation from the front of the book. It takes longer to explain the concept of "pick whatever stats you want; high stats will balance later" than it does for them to actually do it. (Of course, when I run SA at Genericon, I also have a small horde of rabid fans who want to play specific characters they've been dreaming of for years, but that's another story.)<br/><br/>Matthijs, do you have a good example of what you mean by "pedagogy of play?" Another game that does that well?<br/><br/>Jackson, what pages have the blue boxes impinging on the other text?

Colin correct me if I am off base, but I get the feeling that none of the Civilizations are set in stone - that they can be added to, taken away, and seasoned to taste.  Each of them covers numerous worlds and trillions of people, so great variety can exist between any two.  I get the feeling that any group of players would color the setting with their individual interpretations of each civilization in a way that would make each play group's take on them unique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221524/#Comment_221524" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T19:26:52+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  7:26PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 7:36PM by Mike Montesa.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a one shot of this and it was really cool. The setting and the mechanics were a little hard to grok at first but gradually we got into it and in the end had a lot of fun. When we finished, everyone agreed there was a lot of potential and playing more and getting a better grasp of the rules and how to use them would probably result in some pretty awesome stories.<br/><br/>I've pasted my wrap up from the thread on the FLGS forum below. We used characters from the book. You can read the whole thread here:<br/><br/><a href="http://endgameoakland.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3294" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://endgameoakland.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3294</a><br/><br/>Despite my less than firm grasp on the rules, I had a good time and I think it was a fun session. The things that happened in the game were perfectly in keeping with the whole transhuman sci-fi feel that Sufficiently Advanced encourages. <br/><br/>Some highlights for me: <br/><br/>* Breath-of-Mist putting the moves on two different people at the same time. <br/><br/>* The whole idea that Tule's unlicensed tech would cause the collapsars to destabilize and kill everyone involved in the race. Jonathan, that was brilliant! <br/><br/>* A ship-to-ship EVA at .8c. <br/><br/>* Famulus' awesome "but that's why we sent Breath to go hang out with Soma, so that he could plant a wormhole locater on him" use of his Comprehension Theme. <br/><br/>* Seeker losing his grip on the hull and going through the collapsar jump on his own. <br/><br/>* The "battle" between opposing clouds of nanophages and microbots, with Famulus allowing Tule's security nanophages to mess him up only to neutralize them with nano of his own. <br/><br/>* Astina's overall bombed out look and the way she dismantled Tule's ship with her Intuition theme. <br/><br/>So while I still need a better grasp of the system, it worked well enough for us I think. I did really like the way you guys took events in your hands and moved things the way you wanted them.

I get the feeling that any group of players would color the setting with their individual interpretations of each civilization in a way that would make each play group's take on them unique.</blockquote>\nI definitely feel like the civilizations are a flexible thing. There's a big relationship map for them in the book for folks who want to see how they all interact with each other, but that doesn't mean that all of them will be important in any given game.

So to quote myself from a nonexistent thread:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">(this was going to be more of an actual play, but nothing really happened in the session worth writing about, so it's really just a wall of text asking clarifications about the rules)<br/>\n<br/>\nToday we played Sufficiently Advanced, and it went pretty terribly. I'm pretty sure this isn't fully the fault of the system - we didn't take very long to learn the system before just trying to jump in and play - but nevertheless there's a lot of system stuff that if someone could clarify for us it would be greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackground:<br/>\nWe play fairly regularly over IRC, mostly episodic games using The Pool or a variant thereof, but we're slowly branching out with DRYH and TSoY. Yesterday I came across Sufficiently Advanced through the other thread here and basically went 'Holy shit! Finally a system with a bunch of mechanics that directly supports a bunch of stuff in the Planescape setting!'. This group has a bit of a fixation on Planescape, and have been looking for a system that actually works for it for forever. We swapped a few things around, and it kinda worked in that regard. Anyway, that's not really what I want to talk about - it didn't have much of an effect on our problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe came away from the session feeling like our brains had been smeared across the wall, basically. Conflicts are <i>complicated</i>, and the lack of examples didn't help. In 4 hours we got through two scenes - reasonably short scenes, at that - our log for the IC channel is just 126 lines long.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation went basically fine. The one question we had was regarding capabilities - there doesn't appear to be any good reason not to max them all out as far as your import allows. Both players had an import of 8, meaning a maximum capability of 5 for each one - why wouldn't they just set them all at 5? One player did this and we were all very ':-/' trying to work out why it wasn't legal and ... it was.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there's the table there, which we didn't take into account because we didn't flesh that out for our civilisations - but even given that, is there any good reason (besides some strong character concept) not to just put it as the maximum that your culture is allowed?<br/>\nI dunno - maybe it's not a problem, but I feel a bit tetchy when told 'hey, you can be as awesome as you like with no repercussions - but you can shoot yourself in the foot by giving yourself a lower score if you'd like - up to you, really'.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that didn't bog us down too much. Moving on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe details of the characters aren't very interesting - nor is the content of the session, really. I'll just jump to more mechanics questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother minor one before getting stuck into the session breaking stuff - what is the role of themes, really? The impression I got from the rules is that they're the key driving force of the game, well beyond whatever ideas that the GM might have. Everyone else was thinking of them more as get-out-of-jail-free cards, rather than ways for them to, say, actively drive the pacing of the game or what it's about. Do they primarily serve as flags for the GM and ways for the players to change a thing here or there to their benefit, or as ways for the players to grab the game and just outright narrate 'yeah - and we're doing *this* in this way now, because *this* is the theme of my character!'?<br/>\nAnd: Are theme outcomes player narrated? I figured so, but that might have been The Pool talking. I don't see any reference either way in the rules though.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, so - here's how the game broke down. The players are trying to get into a Doomguard citadel on the Quasiplane of Salt to talk to someone there. There are two guards out the front, who they fail to talk their way past. One of the players attacks, and we crunch and grind into an extended conflict.<br/>\nQ1. Should this have been an extended conflict? Going by the rules, it looks like it to me. However, it was really quite a minor problem in the scheme of things - should we be treating extended conflicts more like Bringing Down the Pain in TSoY, and have resolved the conflict in a single roll unless someone demanded otherwise?<br/>\nQ2. I asspulled the stats, figuring 'oh yeah, they're big scary monstrous guards - 5 'stringtech' makes sense'. As a result, this very minor conflict had to go through at least three rounds while the melee fighter PC ground through his reserve. It was rather tedious - so the question is - should stats for NPCs be determined by how important they are to the game, or figured realistically judging by how powerful they seem to be (or - will doing this way slow down the game excessively if we're not floundering around trying to work out the rules as we go?).<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, having a close look at the rules now, and I can see a lot of where we went wrong. While in game I mostly clung onto the flowchart, but now I'm starting to think that the flowchart gave the completely wrong impression of how it works.<br/>\nThe main problem we had is that we basically ignored any order of action - the main thing that guided our 'who goes next' was the box on the flowchart that says 'switch attacker and defender', which we took to mean that immediately following a loss, the loser would get to counterattack the person attacking them. That idea doesn't mesh at all with this line in the text: 'If it\u2019s important to know what order people go in after the first guy, use Offense scores (see below) to figure it out \u2014 the highest combined score goes first.'<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this revised reading, it seems that at the beginning of the timeslice everyone would declare what they're doing and roll offense. In order of highest of the two added offence scores to lowest, they'd act and the person they're attacking would roll defence then. Rinse and repeat until everyone on one side is taken out?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're going to play this again, at any rate - but most of our games are pretty fast and loose - lots of pretty wide-arcing conflict resolution and such. This back-and-forth wasn't as satisfying as we were expecting, even beyond that it took us a few hours to get through it. Hopefully it's just a really steep learning curve or general incompetence by us, because I really like the core beliefs/themes thing and it's nice to not have to go running to The Pool for this sort of game.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n(also, double posting because editing the above makes it 35 characters too long...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222021/#Comment_222021" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T06:52:23+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  6:52AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Aik. Thanks for the questions. Here are some answers.<br><br>On Capabilities: You are correct. Max them out as far as your Import allows. This is intentional. Having one capability at 7 is not much less powerful than having all five capabilities at 7. There are some <a href="http://suffadv.wikidot.com/forum/t-46880/theme-generation-revision" rel="nofollow">alternate rules</a> on the wiki forums if you prefer. Here's my philosophy, quoted from that discussion:\n<blockquote><i>If you're worried about people abusing the rules, my approach with SA was to make abusing the rules the norm, and encourage everyone to do it. If the game is still balanced at that point, then everything's fine. Of course, things break down if not everyone goes to the same lengths of "fold, spindle, and mutilate," which is why I tried to make it pretty easy.</i></blockquote>\nWhen my players use Themes, I typically get the "big idea" of it from them, and then describe as GM. Sometimes there's a little negotiation as to exactly what happens. Sometimes they want to describe it, which I also like. I go with the flow here, which is why there's no specific rule about who gets to narrate.<br><br>Plot Immunity is a "save my bacon" ability, but the other Themes are intended to make the game bend and flex in short-term ways. They work well as flags, but they're intended as a form of story control. Most of my players save them for when the shit hits the fan, but using them early and often works well too. I love when someone says "Hey, Colin, give me three level 2 Complications. I'm taking some Twists to save for later."<br><br>Bringing Down the Pain is a great way to treat extended conflicts, and I wish I had known it better when I wrote SA. You can do similar stuff using the "fold" rule (page 102 at the bottom), but it's not as explicit.<br><br>I <i>always</i> go with realistic stats. If you want a short fight, put in weak guards, but if your Doomguard citadel posts incompetent guards your players should be asking why (and you should have an answer ready, because your players might pull out Comprehension). Because of this, I almost never see my players try to fight their way past guards. They size the guards up with Nanotech, realize they might be outgunned, and send the high-Meta guy in to talk the guards out of their lunch money (and/or pants). If your players would rather blow some Stringtech reserve, that's their call. Most guards (at least in my games) don't have a "stab everyone on sight" order and won't take the conflict into the physical realm unless provoked.<br><br>Your second-to-last paragraph is basically correct. Each timeslice, each player picks a target and rolls when their turn comes up; you only roll defense if someone's actually coming for you. You don't immediately counterattack, you just get to roll when it's your turn. I can see how the flowchart led you wrong there; I'll see if I can make a less misleading one and post it on the wiki. Page 102 may describe things better for you.<br><br>Does all that make sense?
