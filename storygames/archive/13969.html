Combat isn't it's the best way to show them off, however.<br/><br/>For instance, we ran a Jadeclaw game (Ironclaw but in mythic China, different species and careers, that kind of thing).  And the following thing happened all the time:<br/><br/>You gather a dice pool from many different sources, and so does your opposition, and then you roll them all in one big pile like oracle bones and the results tell you something.  My oration skill dice from my Career were weak this roll, but the dice from my own independent skill were much stronger.  Clearly I have captured a passion within me to argue this round.  My opponent rolled poorly to resist my argument, but the bonus die he received to his roll (because of the accusations thrown at me in a previous scene) was the highest die rolled, beating even my oration.<br/><br/>No one believes me, even though I speak passionately, because I was accused already.<br/><br/>The system works the same in combat.<br/><br/>I fire from cover at an opponent, slightly out of range for my weapon.  This gives him some bonus dice, which are different colored.  So if I lose, we can back-narrate how I lost based on the highest die rolled on his side.  (Perhaps the weapon itself malfunctioned, perhaps the range proved too great, perhaps the projectile struck the cliff-side, etc.)<br/><br/>But this pooling rolling cycle happens on each action for every round in combat.  It would be a fantastic system if used for conflict resolution, rather than round-to-round strikes.<br/><br/>However, Jadeclaw, Ironclaw, Usagi Yojimbo, and even Albedo are all heavily dependent on round-to-round actions and detailed combat mechanics.  They all have "techniques" that are really fun and interesting, like "Full Moon Strike" and "Break the Golden Chain to Unleash the Dragon."  And that's more or less the focus of the game.  Gain exp to but cool techniques to be able to kick ass and show off in combat.  True, there are other techniques, other non-combat skills, but they don't occupy much of the book.<br/><br/>Combat plays out like a really cool game of D&amp;D or Wushu, but also a really slow one.  Usagi Yojimbo even has a kind of Mana system to fuel your techniques, and scene based refreshment rolls (feeling much like a blend of TSoY and the new Powers based 4e).  <br/><br/>Them's my two cents.  It has great potential if it is also your flavor.  But it can alienate anyone who wants to get things done quickly inside of combat.<br/><br/>(Edited for grammar.  I was in a hurry the first time..)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316462/#Comment_316462" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T14:36:06+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  2:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything Harlequin said.<br/><br/>A friend really likes the *Claw games, so I joined in for four sessions to see what they were like. The experience reminded me of why I left traditional games several years ago. Everything is slow, a moderately large combat sequence lasted 4 hours of a 4 hour session.<br/><br/>If you were a trad gamer, perhaps you might like it. The setting is detailed, and you don't have to be a furry to enjoy it. And the rules are on the complex side of average, but give some value for the effort spent, like the dice-trick Harlequin mentioned.<br/><br/>But if you have gotten accustomed to the rapid narration and story progression that follows conflict resolution rather than task resolution, like I have, you will pull your hair in frustration.<br/><br/>If you want to play furry stuff, take a look at Mouse Guard, or buy IronClaw for the setting, and use SolarSystem for rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316465/#Comment_316465" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T15:36:15+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  3:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Sanguine games were an influence on my development of Cortex Plus.

It's kind of like your Nature in Mouse Guard.  Is that a positive thing for your, or a kind of impairment?<br><br/>And Ironclaw deals with a lot of undercurrents of racism or species dominance.  Predator/prey behavior.  Is that a bonus, or is it a theme that is important to the genre?<br/><br/>Albedo allows for a massive variety of species, and can really get them custom built to suit your needs, but it assumes  that for the most part they work and live together (except for the Fascist I,L,R, Rabbits...)  Is that the tone you are looking for?<br/><br/>Have you looked into Big Eyes, Small Mouth?

It doesn't hurt that I'm an unabashed Burning Wheel fanboy as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was interested in more of a multi-species game, where you could be more than mice. And potentially, one with neat mechanics that put the fact you were playing as an animal-like humanoid at the forefront.

And it happened precisely because the baboon was no idiot. A fight's a fight and any fight is one where someone can walk away with a missing eye or worse, like a career-ending infection. Ain't no antibiotics in the wild. Sometimes it's just not worth it.<br/><br/>The new IronClaw knows this and bakes it right there into the combat system. The first two things you do when you hit someone in combat is make them take a moment to think things over and make them go away. The first two things! And I've got to tell you, someone pulls a sword on me, those are precisely the first two things I'm doing.<br/><br/>Specifically the first "point of damage," if you will, in IronClaw sends you Reeling, which means on your next round you've got to spend a moment getting over the fact that someone just swung a hunk of sharpened steel at your head. The second "point of damage"--not precisely what it's called but you get the idea--makes you Afraid, which means you can't attack anyone until you've ended the turn out of sight from all attackers. You can counterattack to your heart's content, but you can't press the attack and assault targets of your own choosing until you've done this bit of hiding.<br/><br/>What's more, several prey species, like rabbits, can take advantage of this. They dodge better and move faster when this Afraid condition is on them, because shit just got real. And those who are experienced with combat (that is to say, those with the Veteran gift) can keep their cool a bit longer in a fight, which gives them a distinct and interesting advantage.<br/><br/>It's a deadly combat system in which life ain't cheap.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316769/#Comment_316769" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T00:38:38+00:00" title="March 16, 2011 12:38AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eppy: When I buy Ironclaw, do I send the 10% commission straight to you, or does Sanguine take care of that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316771/#Comment_316771" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T00:48:01+00:00" title="March 16, 2011 12:48AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should point out that as of this post, I'm just a rules admirer, not an experienced rules user when it comes to IronClaw.

The art in the second edition is a bit of a mixed bag, but the color illustrations of all the playable races are done by the same artist (who did the rat above, click on the image to see his Flickr feed and peruse some of the others).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316912/#Comment_316912" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-17T00:29:31+00:00" title="March 17, 2011 12:29AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Captain Thark</cite>I'm just looking for games that have an interesting take on the whole anthro thing. Ironclaw and it's ilk try to sell themselves on that, and I was trying to get a feel for if it sounded like something I'd be interested in playing. Mouseguard is by far the best of the one's I've read, because it actually does make the fact you'e a mouse matter a lot. It doesn't hurt that I'm an unabashed Burning Wheel fanboy as well.<br/><br/>But I was interested in more of a multi-species game, where you could be more than mice. And potentially, one with neat mechanics that put the fact you were playing as an animal-like humanoid at the forefront. Exactly how wasn't really anything I was thinking about, as long as it had some interesting mechanics that elevated it above just using one of the many generics I have floating around (IE:Just Hack Dresden Files).<br/><br/>And sadly, it does not sound like Ironclaw is the game I'm looking for.</blockquote>\nI don't know a whole lot about it because I haven't had enough of a reason to buy it, but a game you might be interested in is "Shard".

It's all animals and the background looks like it's India-influenced, instead of the typical Euro-influence. If I could justify it, I'd pick it up; system does seem a bit heavier than I normally prefer which makes it a harder purchase for me as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317060/#Comment_317060" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T08:14:47+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  8:14AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To scratch my anthropomorphic itch, I'd be much more likely to go the wargaming route with the <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/44342/song-of-the-splintered-lands" rel="nofollow">Song of the Splintered Lands</a> setting and miniatures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317062/#Comment_317062" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T09:05:19+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  9:05AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how on earth I could ever want to play this game.
