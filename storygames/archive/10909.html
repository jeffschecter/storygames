I suggest trying to make a map of some sort work. Do you have a lack of space because the table is small or because everybody sits in different parts of the room and there is no common table at all? If the former, consider drawing the map on paper and just marking positions with the pen, drafting over things and recopying as necessary. It'll be messy, but you can throw out the paper as it becomes unintelligible, and you don't need to be as exact as a battlemap set-up would be: just mark down approximate positions, draw arrows to indicate movement and so on. You might even consider using pins instead of figures to save space; get some paper with very small squares and use that with different colored pin-heads; a typical battle should fit easily in space smaller than a character sheet. You could even pass the situation around for players to look at if you pin the map on a suitably pincushiony writing board.<br/><br/>If you don't have a table at all, then do the pin-table thing I suggested there and have the map make the rounds, or get a portable video projector and project the entire battle set-up on a wall/ceiling/floor. The DM (or a dedicated cartographer) can keep the map up to date easily enough on a laptop, while the players call out their actions to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242036/#Comment_242036" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T10:24:00+00:00" title="November 15, 2009 10:24AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We sit scattered through the room.

If the players engage primarily with the rules as a tool of overcoming challenges, then fudging the map just took away 80% of the meaning in their play. On the other hand, if the players primarily concern themselves with fictional strategy and tactics, then I could see DM-imposed fudging, just like Dev describes. Then again, playing 4th edition with a fiction first attitude is pretty much missing the point of the game, it seems to me.<br/><br/>An easel is a nice idea, although it'd need to be large enough for the players to see it comfortably at whatever distance they'd sit. A video projector (they're getting to be pretty cheap nowadays, you know, and they're useful for this sort of gaming) has the advantage of copious graphics that help distinguish things from each other on the map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242339/#Comment_242339" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T03:48:45+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  3:48AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another easel-ish option:  get a dry-erase whiteboard, paint grid lines on it (or draw them with a permanent marker).  You can even find magnetic dry-erase boards, which let you use little magnets for characters and slide them around easily.<br/><br/>I do agree that from what I've seen of 4e, a lot of the fun of several classes and many, many powers is heavily dependent on position.  You can half-ass it and make positioning more abstract, but the result will be to make those classes and powers less appealing (and probably less useful).  This may not be a deadly flaw for some groups, but it's something to consider before doing it.

Things like opportunity attacks, flanks and one-square shifts, etc.  What parts where too much, did you think?  In play I didn't find there were too much problems with it, but the idea of some the subsystems seems to chase people away sometimes.  I'm totally curious what parts were confusing/too much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, uh...hello!

I'm more interested now that I hear it was actually played/playtested, honestly. How did the players receive it?<br/><br/>If I'm intimidated by Fluid 4e, it's because there's a new parallel set of mechanics - move save / move advantage - to be rolled for and tracks, and that I'd have to teach to players. Moving becomes something uncertain (like combat) requiring rolling and mechanical handling, rather than a predictable kind of basis on which to make your less-predictable attack. On the other hand, the collapsing of movement-squares into bands of movement seems simple to me. I think I'm comparing the system you propose to my idealized sensed of how it work if players described what they wanted to accomplish vs the DM's reckoning, and those precise squares of movement are just part of the players' justifications (that they could move 30' without trouble, or that they could push a foe 10' on a hit).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
