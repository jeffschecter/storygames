I wish I had insight that wasn't splattered all over the other threads connected to or tangential to this discussion, but alas, I don't.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to decide, will games like IaWA, or the forthcoming BRS or HotB scratch that itch at all?  And these types of discussions help me assess that, to some degree (recognizing that Actual Play accounts - useful ones that include some indication of what's going on among the players at the table - are equally good data points for such evaluations).<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically, I'm looking for a game that supports play that *feels* like I'm making tactical choices that have real teeth within the system of the game, but that these systems don't interfere overly much with how we, as players, build the SIS and/or address Premise.<br/>\n<br/>\nCapes, for me, is an object example of this.  The concepts behind the game are mechanically very neat.  But in two sessions of one shot play, those same neat concepts really, really got in the way of how we wanted to build the SIS.  We were free to address premise to a satisfying extent, but the game was un-fun for us as a group.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm a believer that transitional play or hybrid play supporting games are already out there, I'm just looking for one that better fits my play style.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondarily, I'm a Game Theory hobbyist junkie and inveterate game system hacker that loves this kind of design wonkery.

There is a premise, "Power is fun, but do you deserve it?" And gameplay is very much a competition to gain story power to have more control over the direction of the story. Though there's not really a clear "victory" state that might be excepted of pure gamist design.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164165/#Comment_164165" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T13:04:14+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  1:04PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blood Red Sands (BRS) looks like it attempts something similar to what I'm working on with Agora: that is, it is a pretty straightforwardly gamist design where players will be competing with each other throughout the game, and it throws off a cool and character-driven story as a byproduct.

"step on up" is poison to this game).  It's direct progenitor is Sorcerer, after all.<br><br>I think you are confusing "game with a premise" with "games with a front-loaded premise" like MLWM. IAWA has a premise when you play it, in the same way PTA has one. It's chosen by the character during play. The best interests and  the "how much I accept to be hurt to get what I want" conflict are but two of the way the game will support that premise.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh" title="JasonLeigh"><img alt="JasonLeigh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh">JasonLeigh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164352/#Comment_164352" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T06:56:35+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  6:56AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin:<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry about the acronyms.

The restrictions the game put on the "step on up" direction aren't outside of the rules or tied to local scene or local time, but they are tied to the group consensus about the fiction, and this is implicit in the rules (and explicit in the explanations Vincent gave on his forum at the forge). In other words, all that stand between me and declaring, by the rules of the game, that I put my opponent at disadvantage by destroying his entire race and imprisoning him for 10000 years as a mummy in a tomb, is the look I would see in the other player's face (that, by the way, would make that move invalid).<br><br>A strong, solid, creative consensus about what it' acceptable during the game is necessary to play (and I see this as a weakness of the game, in the sense that I think that it's really and emphatically not for every game group, and that to be able to play it well, a group should be able to play freeform ruleless with no problem, too). Step on up priorities would be incompatible with this. We as a group could play with some (secondary) step on up many different indie games, but not IAWA.  Stopped the game cold every time until we learned to completely suppress it, because every real conflict between players go right to the social level. By the rules of the game. It's like it has written "if you really want to show the other that you are the better player, stop the game and argue".                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164367/#Comment_164367" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T08:10:41+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  8:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that you can play In a Wicked Age harder, with no trouble, than Moreno has. <br><br>I agree with his points generally.

This touches on an earlier thread where Marshall contrasted Play to Win with Disco/Heavy Metal Samurai play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the latter, you play to win...but you do so within the voluntary (but just-as-important-as-mechanical-rules) confine that maintaining (or better...enhancing) the group aesthetic is one of the accepted contraints of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play IaWA without that constraint, I think you can have a rough time of it.  But played "Heavy Metal Samurai" style you can totally play hard to win.  Because the aesthetic is part of the win condition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is pretty much what Moreno is saying, but I think an important distinction is where the emphasis is put.  I think this respect for the group aesthetic is the default standard for measuring Gamism and can be assumed to be inherent in the phrase "Step on up".  By that I mean that the definitional phrase is not "Play to win at any cost".  Step on up automatically implies social appreciation as the prize for winning.  Playing to "win" where you are fighting for your character's goals irrespective of the group aesthetic is rather a more extreme hard core variant of Gamism...not the standard.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited to add:<br/>\n<br/>\nTo tie this into earlier questions on Blood Red Sands, this is very much the design paradigm BRS is written within.  The Challenge Mechanic, I view as a strength because it provides an ingame mechanism for testing and reinforcing this aesthetic.  When gestures, sighs, and eyerolls fail one can resort to the rules rather than to charisma and social manipulation.  Because the implementation has something of a Viking boasting flair to it (with people standing up to loom over the people their Challenging...and having to utter the phrase "as you will" when they fail and have to submit) it keeps players in the spirit of the fiction even as it resolves a meta level dispute.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164379/#Comment_164379" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T08:52:39+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  8:52AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JasonLeigh</cite>Josh:<br><br>Can you point me to any forum or blog discussions of Agora, or do you have draft rules as yet?

I am in the middle of rewriting the rules from the ground up for "3.0" which I'll be sending into beta playtest in a couple months.<br><br>Agora is not Story Now, at least not by any strict definition.  Player choices are almost always based on tactical, rather than narrative, considerations.  However, the game is constituted such that players fully committed to playing their characters to advantage will create a very cool narrative and build a vibrant setting.  You can see this developing as it happens, and there are lots of moments where something happens and you wonder what will come of it in the future (for a totally geeky example, our "friar tuck" character once shifted the faith she and her followers practiced from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthodoxy" rel="nofollow">orthodoxy</a> to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthopraxy" rel="nofollow">orthopraxy</a>, and there was much oooing and ahhing).<br><br>At the end of the day, though, I'm less interested in fitting my games into a category than creating an interesting social context in which they operate.

Sound about right?</br></blockquote>\nI think that the answer would be "how much" you would amp the Step on Up. And what you mean by step on up. I noticed that what passes for "step on up" for many story-gamers is a very, very cute, educated, timid and good-natured version of the real beast...  ;-)<br><br>(I think I remember this was the subject of a good thread some months ago, but I seem to be unable to find the link now...)<br><br>In any case, I think that it could support Step on Up only as a very distant secondary priority. And I have a lot of doubts even about that. I don't think it endorse a Gamist creative Agenda (as it was written in the post I was responding to) at all.<br><br>Reading again my last post I noticed that I didn't qualify well what I was talking about.  A natural question would have been "but if you don't have a solid creative consensus, you can't play any narrativist game. What it's the difference in IAWA?".  <br><br>It's not a big difference, so it's not like I think that it's not a narrativist game or something like that. I think that it's an harder, more difficult game that it seems, though.<br><br>Let's try to explain it using an example.  Vincent will probably hate me now because I will use DitV, but really I couldn't find a better example of what I was talking about. In DitV you have both a veto system where any player can stop a disruptive raise, and a lot of bargaining between GM and players, or between players, first to set the right stakes, then to get the right (acceptable) raises and sees. The effect that I have seen playing it many times is that the system really HELP to reach that shared understanding of the fiction you need to get good results from the game. If you are willing to play by the rules, and you don't have some kind of strong personal issue with some other player, getting everybody on the same page is only a question of time. A very short time usually. So I have been able to play DitV even with not "perfect" group, or even with unknown people at conventions. Not that convention games has ever been too great, without the time needed to "attune" the group enough, but it got near enough to play good enough results.<br><br>IAWA instead take that shared understanding as a given, before playing, and during the game not only doesn't really help you a lot to reach it, but TEST it. I was really surprised, playing it, about how much it re-opened some problems that I though were solved a lot of months ago in our game group.  Not insurmountable problems. We talked about it and we solved them enough to continue playing IAWA. But it had to be done outside of the game session. And I could never play a IAWA session with people at a convention that didn't get, during the game, to a point where that shared understanding did break down.<br><br>As  I said, nothing too problematic for a lot of people here. But I think that IAWA is, from this point of view, a second-generation game. It's not anymore for people dissatisfied with their gaming, as it was the case for a lot of first-generation games at the forge (and was for DitV, that is written to a implied reader that know very well traditional rpgs and it's dissatisfied with them). It's for people who are very satisfied with the group consensus they have reached, so much that they, really, could play together without any written rules.<br><br>[edit: I really type too slow in English.

We never got to the point where the mechanics felt like they were a natural part of play.  Basically, the IIEE structure was too hard for us to manage as a group, and got in the way of the fun.  Who got to speak, who got to roll again (I don't have the book in front of me at the moment, and it's been a year-ish since we played), all of that served to break us out of the groove we were in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had all gone through the flash demo of how to play.  It seemed reasonable enough, we all seemed to understand it in the abstract, but during actual play, things got too confused.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're not immersion players, so it wasn't that the rules interfered with that.  We've had fun playing Donjon, The Shadow of Yesterday, Sorcerer and Dogs in the Vineyard.  By and large, the order of play/mechanics of those games didn't get in the way of our play style from the jump.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if that helps, or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Jason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164594/#Comment_164594" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T11:07:48+00:00" title="August 23, 2008 11:07AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Jason!<br><br>OK, I see what you mean now. based on these criteria:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JasonLeigh</cite>Specifically, I'm looking for a game that supports play that *feels* like I'm making tactical choices that have real teeth within the system of the game, but that these systems don't interfere overly much with how we, as players, build the SIS and/or address Premise.<br/></blockquote>\nYou're saying that the SIS suffered from a sort of befuddlement over the systemic framework that overlays the narration?<br><br>This is probably the greatest difficulty in playing capes. There's a tendency to get lost in the different phases of play and the fiddly things that go along with them. Stuff like "wait, wait--whose turn was it again? No, that was <i>your</i> turn and my <i>reaction</i>. No, you hafta roll <i>this</i> die when you're reacting" and so forth.

It might take a more long-term game to build more systemic confidence and facilitate a more robust and stable SIS. I'd love to try that.
