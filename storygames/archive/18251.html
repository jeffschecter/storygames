Something along the lines of Greek mythology, or Greek mythology "turned up to 11" like you see in the God of War video games?  I recognize that when you are playing a fighter you may be The Fighter, and The Wizard and so on, which is remarkable, but I always have had the feeling that DW/AW tend to push towards grittier games.  Is this just my own bias?  has anyone successfully used DW for a scale that includes legendary feats like the Labors of Hercules?  Thanks in advance for your feedback.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411599/#Comment_411599" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T15:58:36+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  3:58PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't see why not <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>It just be a matter of comparative scales.

I am not saying this because of the way the characters are run, per se, but because all of those systems have a party working together against a force.  Most Greek style myths are about single heros that did great things on their own.  You don't have many "Greek Hero Parties".  The Argonauts come to mind, but even in that group of superstars, there are some that are dramatically better than the others and are thus the focus of the story (Jason for instance).  I can't think of another one that was not just one hero and a munch of extras to carry whatever he killed back.  You would have to work out some kind of sharing mechanic for the hero and opposition so everyone playing gets a chance to be in the driver's seat for a little while... maybe Polaris?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman" title="ticktockman"><img alt="ticktockman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ticktockman">ticktockman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411619/#Comment_411619" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T19:59:18+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  7:59PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting observation, SteveDave.

If you decide you're doing a street level gritty campaign, then that's how you scale your descriptions. If you decide your characters can do Xena style wire-fu and punch gods in the face, then you scale it that way.<br/><br/>A lot of things in DW are intentionally vague. For example, the basic way you increase your mechanical effect in a fight is to narrate yourself into being able to target more bad guys with your attack. There's no hard limit on that - it's just whatever makes sense with how you're playing. If you're playing at epic godlike scale, you could narrate how your attack is a whole frickin avalanche that takes out an entire bandit camp with one move.<br/><br/>My suggestion would be that if you scale up effectiveness a whole lot, then you should scale up weaknesses as well. It's the whole thing where Superman is kind of a hard character to write for. You have to play up his fragile love interests (which gets into repetitive damsel in distress territory quickly) and his desire to separate his hero life from his "normal everyday guy" life and his overwhelming desire to do the right thing and have no collateral damage before he actually gets interesting - otherwise you have to use kryptonite all the freakin time, which also gets repetitive.<br/><br/>Look at the Xena show as an example. Xena used to be a badass, feared warlord. What makes her work as a character is her struggle to put that behind her and help people. What's awesome is all the ways she tries to look for another way to do things rather than constantly fighting. Sure, she gets into scuffles all the time. But she doesn't just take the frontal assault approach. She tries other things, like disguise, persuasion, manipulation, and lots of other indirect approaches. She almost never takes the warlord approach - raise an army and raid. For a solo campaign, in particular, encouraging the player to take different approaches to solving problems helps keep things fresh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
