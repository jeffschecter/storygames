Something along the lines of "Doing anything in a firefight can get you killed, including doing nothing." or something like that. I laughed to myself I thought "Hey like Dread?" to which I had my epiphany. I had been searching for a rules lite abstract war RPG that used tactics predominately as flavor yet still had backing in the mechanics for forever now. I then decided to try my hand at writing hacks. So Dread everybody is the cadaver I'm dissecting. Has anyone else tried this, if so how did it go? What would you change? What would questioners look like? Is there a better alternative? <br/><br/>I also was thinking about using Carry but it seemed to steeped in what it was originally designed to do. I know I'm being vague but even I am unable to describe quite what I'm interested in. I'd love to have the talent to convey that and make my own game but alas. I would love to hear any comments or advice on anything relating to my topic.                   </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424333/#Comment_424333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-17T18:41:40+00:00" title="November 17, 2013  6:41PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you die, you come back as a green recruit.

I have also peaked at Unsung and plan on picking it up after school to see how it handles the material.\n<blockquote>When you die, you come back as a green recruit.  Play until only one origional player is left.</blockquote>\nI actually like that as the way of determining when the game ends. Especially as a bit of a metaphor of a war on terror game inwhich it's a never ending conflict, a cycle that repeats with each batch of troops. I would end on a note of the last survivor of the original unit getting ready to go on another patrol with the new guys. So in a way it becomes a game about the evolution of the hardened vetern archetype in play. I love it. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424370/#Comment_424370" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-18T10:12:52+00:00" title="November 18, 2013 10:12AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a Dread game called "The Wild Hunt".
