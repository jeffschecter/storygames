Why yes; yes it is. And that means that this is the last month of eligibility for the 2011 ENnie Awards!<br/><br/>For a product to be eligible, it must have a publishing date of no later than April 30, 2011. And then, if it's an e-submission, it must be submitted no later than May 8. If it's shipped, the postmark must be no later than May 8.<br/><br/>So if you're a publisher and you haven't submitted your product yet, I don't mean to pressure you, but you only have 37 days to get it done! And if you're a fan who wants your favorite publisher to submit, check out the<a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">Submissions</a> page. If you don't see what you want, tell your favorite publisher to submit their product. If it's not submitted, we can't judge it!<br/><br/>Tony Law<br/>ENnie Awards Business Manager                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
