We have two paragons and a third on the cusp.<br/><br/>Following their most recent triumph\u2014this time restoring the Empire's weather and preventing a horrendous famine\u2014the Crimson Blades have begun the long odyssey back to their home city of Greyhawk.  WIth them: a motley army of hobbits, ski archers, minotaurs, kenku, and mageblades, all eager for adventure and treasure.<br/><br/>At the dwarven gate-fortress of Hamarkand,  the Blades demand unhindered passage through the Ossen Mutark thoroughfare that pierces the barrier peaks.  But they will offer nothing in tribute or service to the paranoid Fang Thane, and the dwarven commander orders them driven off.<br/><br/>Bolts fly from the dwarven garrison!  Casualties are high on both sides.<br/><br/>It becomes a real tabletop freakout when a trio of enormous aboleths burst from the stony ground, seeking not to attack the combatants but instead to steal the fallen as "beautiful fuel for the dreaming pits."  The Blades do not hesitate to  descend into the slimy aboleth tunnels and fight viciously to recover their dead.<br/><br/>(Hard Boiled Armies is a seriously cool product.  Ever since I read Knights of the Dinner Table, I have wanted to do epic KODT-style wars as part of my tabletop games, and HBA does exactly that.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347891/#Comment_347891" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T15:28:20+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  3:28PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More While the World Ends.

I was hoping it would be a more complete one-shot, but everyone had fun and the n00b enjoyed herself very much - it's a very n00b-friendly game. She used Lady Blackbird's stormblood powers in some very interesting ways (in particular, to help Snargle pilot the ship in a tricky spot by giving him favourable winds). At one point it became apparent that she had been playing the game competitively "against" the other players, which was really interesting, as I hadn't thought to point out that RPGs are generally cooperative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348793/#Comment_348793" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-12T21:18:46+00:00" title="November 12, 2011  9:18PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco, during the Aftermath:<br/><br/>Me: "So this die is you digging up my grave to make my bones into a necklace."<br/>Aleister Crowley's player: "Yes it is."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348812/#Comment_348812" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-13T07:11:18+00:00" title="November 13, 2011  7:11AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2011 7:12AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Facilitated three Fiasco sessions at MACE in High Point, NC.

Since then, there have been increased disappearances in the crops and foodstuffs of the town that are being blamed on the local Wild Mice. The patrol investigates and learns that members of the Blue Feather have been disappearing, seemingly murdered. The tribe's best trackers know that the culprit is somewhere in Wolfpointe and have been taking their retribution in the form of crops and food, as is their way. <br/><br/>Evidence gathered with the Blue Feather points to Chesterton and through a two-pronged approach of breaking-and-entering and guile, the patrol discovers Chesterton's grizzly secret trophy room, which features several Wild Mouse skins. Everyone is outraged, including the Wolfpointe village leader, who would deal frontier justice immediately. The judicious patrol leader Kynes knows that executing the politically powerful Chesterton would have vast consequences. He considers delivering the magnate to the Wild Mice but thinks this will be a death blow for the tribes if they decide to execute him. <br/><br/>In the end, the patrol leader sends the rest of the patrol to the Wild Mice with peace offerings pilfered from Chesterton's vast stores. With the patrol away (and thus, absolved) Kynes hands Chesterton over to the Wolfpointe leader. Chesterton's head on the block and the whole village out to witness his execution, Kynes asks if he has any last words. <br/><br/>"None that are worthy for you lot." Chesterton sneers and then spits on the dusty earth, his head hitting the ground shortly afterwards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349198/#Comment_349198" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-18T18:19:31+00:00" title="November 18, 2011  6:19PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing a lot of Microscope-on-demand at Story Games Seattle recently (oh no, woe is me!).

I have to get away. Start over. The loneliness.\u201d<br/><br/>Outside, a girl in a white dress watches the house. She shivers in the cold. She sees the mechanical boy look out of the one lit window. She sees the old man leave, and he is going around the house \u2026 with wires \u2026 and dynamite. He has a detonator. He means to blow up the house? Get a fresh start that way?<br/>She steps out. He notices her. Fate! He\u2019s decided to end his loneliness and here, before him, a beautiful woman.<br/>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks.<br/>\u201cI\u2019m burning my bridges,\u201d he says.<br/>\u201cHow can I get you to stop?

When he gets to the special machine that winds him up, he discovers it has been smashed and broken. He feels himself winding down...<br/><br/>The girl is allowing the clockmaker to have his way with her. As he comes, she feels for a rock, lifts it, smashes him in the head. And she is up, running, running to the house.<br/>Walking out of the house, the boy. Holding a stick of dynamite in his clockwork hand.<br/>She runs to him, throws herself around him, kisses him. She is crying.<br/>The wetness of the kiss, her tears, shocks him. Electricity arcs. \u201cI told you to be careful \u2026 kissing \u2026 me,\u201d he says, as he shuts down.<br/>She winds him back up, as the clockmaker approaches, holding the detonator.<br/>They stare at him.<br/>He tenses over the plunger.<br/>But no, he cannot do it.<br/>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks the girl.<br/>\u201cSkyla,\u201d she says. \u201cI work at the shop. That\u2019s where we met.\u201d She looks at the clockwork boy.<br/>He nods. \u201cI was looking for a lover. But maybe.

The game is a post war sci-fi setting where super powered humans and normal humans clashed (actually there were supers on both sides.)  The war ended when the human resorted to orbital bombardment and broke the supers will to fight.  In the post war era, most supers gravitate towards the frontier where the shortage in manpower makes them more effective.  Our heroes (supers on the losing side of the war) work aboard an eccentric ex-war transport with a goofy AI doing odd jobs for The Company which is the dirty jobs division of The Corporation.<br/><br/>All three of the players were new to PTA, but since we all played The Trouble with Rose several times, it didn't take us long to get up to speed on the differences between the two games.  The fan mail system took a while to warm up to since we didn't have a baseline of what was awesome or not.  The net result was that 4 and half hours passed by in a flash.  Good times, looking forward to the other sessions in the series (the Producer has played one-shots before but want to see how a weekly series handled.)<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ivan%20Dervisevic" title="Ivan Dervisevic"><img alt="Ivan Dervisevic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ivan%20Dervisevic">Ivan Dervisevic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349640/#Comment_349640" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-24T20:34:38+00:00" title="November 24, 2011  8:34PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My role-playing has always really sporadic these past few years and after weeks and weeks of trying to get a real campaign off the ground, I gave up and instituted "alternative one-shot rpg afternoons." This last Sunday, we got together for our first session of our first game and played In a Wicked Age.<br/>\n<br/>\nA soul of a dead wizard kept battling against a malevolent genie (whom he woke up, along with his very, very evil brothers) for control of a pretty evil child. The child, corrupted by the horrible energies around it deceived everyone around himself and tried constantly to sacrifice his guardian. In the end, our scholar/adopted mother of the child, fell to the corruption of one of the genies, the child used his evil powers to goad townsfolk into hunting his guardian, the soul of the wizard defeated his soulless body, escaped the genie brothers and finally possessed the child's body at the exact moment that his guardian put an arrow through the kid's throat. Our next story is set during the rehearsal of a funeral of an old mayor, somewhere nearby.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I really need to gm more. I was SO bad at setting scenes, pushing forward and actually tying things together.
