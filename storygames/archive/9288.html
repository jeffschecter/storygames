It has to be defined and written down in free play, but then called up at the moment conflict starts based on what makes sense in the fiction.  <br/><br/>I'm just wondering how to go from "thing we talk about" to "write this down and give it a d8" in free play.

Especially since I often have trouble deciding which second form is appropriate to a situation.  Usually the first form is very obvious, while the second form can be one of two or three.<br/><br/>With the collective pool, would those dice reset after each conflict?  I'm also wondering if said pool would only have one of each die type.  Or, more to the point, what's the point of defining a "pool" if there's no restriction as to the available die sizes?  If the pool has more than enough dice, then you might as well just use "player decides, but GM calls bullshit."  And if there is a limit to the pool, you might be forced to take a die that you feel doesn't quite represent your situation (i.e. "I've got tiny knife that I barely know how to use, but all that's left in the pool is a d12").  <br/><br/>You could have a player or GM-controlled vote to see which participant gets which die, based on situation, but methinks that the advantage die system already takes this into account.  Note that IAWA focuses on determining situational advantage after the first roll, instead before the rolls (as is the case in, say, D&amp;D).<br/><br/>Another question that arises is how to handle taking dice damage.  We play with "use it, risk it" rule, so the two forms you use are the two forms that are damaged if you lose the conflict.  However, what gets damaged here if you lose?  Obviously the first form, but do you arbitrarily pick a second form? Does your opponent choose it?  Do you negotiate?  Etc.<br/><br/>Anywho, these are just some ramblings that might help you think about how to go about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205717/#Comment_205717" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T13:06:45+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  1:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So...

I don't think you can get fast and fair at the same time, without a metric. Developing a metric requires that all players have equal access to scene (normally somewhat uncontrollable) and a strong understanding of the stats behind dice as used in IAWA. It's not enough just to think Bigger Is Better, because of the We Owe list and how it can provide a major bonus (+d6 to another die).<br/><br/>And what of this "fairness" of which you speak? Could there be a bit of competition for narrative control amongst your players? I'm reminded of all the DITV threads with folks saying, "Damn, I can't beat the Dogs--they invoke every Trait every conflict!" and all of the replies of "So?" What breaks if you just let players pick up to a d10, by their own decision, based on the "oomph" of the situation invoked?<br/><br/>Hmmm... Idea: Maybe you could just make it player fiat, BUT when they do it, their chosen form is the one that MUST be exhausted/injured/shamed; they lose choice if they lose The Stick? So if I just choose two of my forms, I am free to choose what forms get exhausted/injured/shamed; but if I go yanking a situational die, my chosen form MUST be the one reduced by a die rank, if I lose.<br/><br/>OO! Or to REALLY make it a touch call, and reduce die munchkinism, the chosen form will go down by the absolute value of the difference in die ranks between it and the situational die (minimum of one die rank). For example:<br/>* I choose a d6 form and pull a d10 die - that's a difference of two die ranks, so I could lose the form entirely if I lose the conflict (-2 ranks = d6 -&gt; d4 -&gt; d0)<br/>* I choose a d8 form and pull a d4 - again, a difference of two ranks, so I could go down to a d4 in it (-2 ranks = d8 -&gt; d6 -&gt; d4)<br/>* I choose a d6 form and pull a d6, d4, or d8 - a difference of zero or one rank, but the minimum is one rank lost, so I could go down to a d4<br/><br/>Workable? It's at least a bit self-correcting, and makes for a strategic choice by the player rather than a game balance ("fair") choice for the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205722/#Comment_205722" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T13:14:50+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  1:14PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if:<br/>You can grab whatever size die you want from the die pit, but higher dice run a bigger risk.<br/><br/>Like, if your situational die is a...<br/>...d4, then they can only force damage on the other die you are rolling<br/>...d6-8, then they can force damage on the die you are rolling and the "other half" of its damage category (exhausted, injured, shamed)<br/>...d10, then they can force damage on the die you are rolling, and any one other die<br/>...d12, then they can force damage on any two of your dice<br/><br/>Then there's a mechanical check, but it's (in my mind) not a hard or especially harsh one.

I like these things, that invest something other than PC sheet info about PC with game relevance in a recurring way similar to PC info.<br/><br/>So if you mean something like, player describing the hot humid jungle air that hangs like a cloying blanket over everyone and everything, then can put a dice on that element, then can bring that element in - "I sneak up on the guards as they drowse under the influence of this smothering blanket of humidity and run them through." for a dice to add to their Form?<br/><br/>To keep balanced in current IAWA rules, you can't bring in a component this way with a bigger die value than a 2nd form you would use in standard rules.<br/><br/>Such elements are now a permanent feature, with that dice, and thereafter others can call on it too.  Elements like these are written down on a list (like the Owe List is kept), dice values put beside them - perhaps physical dice (or they're on index cards, whatever).  When dice are taken off them they don't refresh until (xxx, next conflict or next chapter), to stop boring use of same thing over and over.  So A creates element, B reincorporates it in scene, but then it can't be used again until the refresh.<br/><br/>When an element used, if the user wins contest the element is deemed more significant and gains a dice size when it refreshes (though if increasing over d12 it has "graduated" and isn't used again).  If the user loses contest, the element is deemed not significant and loses a dice size (being erased completely if sinking under d4).  That keeps new elements coming in rather than just same stable in longer term.<br/><br/>I'm thinking there needs to be some GM or table-authority over "you ask for too much" there unless it's the coolest players in world sitting around table.<br/><br/>(PS Ryan, completely understand the 95% IAWA, I like a tactical itch scratched sometimes but IAWA is the most fun per effort put in I've seen)<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205740/#Comment_205740" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T13:59:27+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  1:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2009 2:05PM by MikeRiverso.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite><br/>How much better is it?</blockquote>\nWell, that's what the various ideas mentioned above are for, I guess.  Personally, I would consider not asking the question "how much better is it?", but instead asking the question "who has it better?".  To illustrate with an example from D&amp;D 4E, there are a LOT of situations that grant a PC "combat advantage", a static +2 bonus to an attack roll, but even if you have multiple sources of combat advantage (let's say you're flanking a prone target who's also blind), you only get the +2 bonus once.  Either you have combat advantage or you don't.<br/><br/>To translate this into IAWA, you could just say that one person gets a d6, the other gets a d8*, based on which one has the advantage.  No need to know exactly how much of an advantage is involved, but only that there IS an advantage.  In multiple-person conflicts, you could have one of each die size, and null for the rest (if there are that many participants).  As a bonus, is much easier for the group to decide who has the advantage, rather than nitpicking of the exact degree of advantage.<br/><br/>*or d8 and d10, or d6 and d10, or whatever.  Playtesting would be required.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205741/#Comment_205741" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T13:59:42+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  1:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2009 2:00PM by Ry.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Then why do you need a pool of available dice?</blockquote>They've got to sit somewhere, and a pool in the middle of us obvious who's taking what if it gets hairy.  I kind of imagine them sitting on the map, bright red so it's easy to tell who picked what.  <br/><br/>I'm not saying the pool should be limited (that's my objection to a personal stock of dice per player - my second post) just that it needs to be obvious that it's not coming from your character sheet, and everybody needs to be able to see what you're doing (and kind of get why).  <br/><br/>Also, everybody needs to be on the same page; if two guys are both trying to take a d8 higher ground, and they're facing each other, you need to do that "wait, I'll draw a picture".  If they both grab the d8 out of the center we can tell that they both think they've got some kind of advantage.

As I've read this thread, Ryan seems to want to tweak the use of forms rules to accommodate advantages gained during the situations leading up to the confli-- ...Oh, wait, I think I got it. I think I see what's gone horribly wrong....<br/><br/>Ryan, you might be trying to do Fortune at the End (FatE), but IAWA is Fortune at the Beginning, from round to round. You don't "leap down from the roof" and, thus, get a d10 rather than one of your forms. Rather, you roll forms to determine IF you've gained advantage in the overall conflict, which you could well narrate as leaping down from roofs, if you win narration rights.<br/><br/>Not saying you can't do it as part of a preamble--pre-round-one. But after the FIRST roll (initiative), the dice tell you who's winning or losing advantage; not YOU (i.e. any player, GM included) presuming advantage from the fluid situation and getting a bigger or smaller die.
