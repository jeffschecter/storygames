                    So the guy known as RPGpundit has started his own <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=33" rel="nofollow">Theory and Game Design forum</a> on theRPGsite.  I, for one, was really excited to see what stuff Pundit and the other people there would come up with and what kind of environment it would be.  Pundit clearly considers himself to be against all of the theory stuff that has come out of the Forge, especially GNS, and supports a view of roleplaying that is so ultra-conservative that you might call it reactionary (something like "roleplaying is totally awesome as it is and doesn't need much changing").<br/><br/>He recently posted his <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1480" rel="nofollow">Landmarks of Gaming Theory</a>, which I will quote extensively below.  I'm gonna gloss over his absolutism, tendency to define things negatively (i.e. "not A" instead of "B"), and the anti-Forge rhetoric, because I think that weakens his argument somewhat, but there's actually quite a bit of interesting stuff here:<br/><br/><i>A Landmark is a go/no-go test based on simple statements about the reality of RPGs as they apply to the mainstream of people playing them today!<br/><br/>...Here are my "Landmarks of Gaming Theory":<br/><br/>1. The vast majority of gamers are having fun gaming.<br/><br/>2. The vast majority of gamers are satisfied with the majority of their game as it is played.<br/><br/>3. D&amp;D is the model of what most people define as an RPG, and therefore also the model for a successfully-designed RPG. It can be improved upon or changed... You don't have to say it is the "best" RPG, but you are obviously not in touch with reality if your theory claims that D&amp;D is a "bad" game...<br/><br/>4. Given number 3 above, it is self-evident that games that have a broad spectrum of playstyles (as D&amp;D does) are by definition successful games. ...Note that this doesn't mean that you must say narrow-focus games are "bad", or that narrow-focused games can't be considered appropriate...<br/><br/>5. Conflicts do arise in gaming groups; these conflicts are usually the product of social interaction between the players and not a problem with the rules themselves. The solution to these problems is not to "Narrow the rules", but to broaden the playstyle of a group to accomodate what the complaining players are missing...<br/><br/>6. ...The vast majority of players enjoy a game where the GM has power over the world and the players over their characters; and while a theory can suggest ways that GMs and Players can experiment with interactively creating the setting, it cannot suggest that the Players should have the power to tell the GM what to do (except for the "power" to walk away from a game).<br/><br/>7. Any gaming theory that tries to divide gamers into specific criteria of "types" must make it clear that this is only one kind of categorization, and not an absolutist and literal interpretation that is a universal truth; it is only one form of categorizing gamers.<br/><br/>8. Any theory that suggests, therefore, that its "types" are mutually exclusionary in gaming groups is in violation of the Landmarks. Individual people can end up being mutually exclusive to each other, unable to play in the same group, etc; but that is because of individual personal issues, not because of an issue of playstyle.<br/><br/>9. &amp; 10.</i> [cut]                </div>

                            (cont.)<br/><br/>Okay, so 1-3 basically seem like an attempt to push for positivity and especially pro-D&amp;D positivity in theory.  Which is cool.  Yay, positivity!  Yay, D&amp;D!<br/><br/>4 is a move away from what has recently become the forte of indie games: being really focused on doing a few things well.  I just hope that pushing in the other direction isn't going to result in more "generic" or "universal" systems that lack real direction in their mechanics.  More things like Fate and The Pool and Active Exploits and Shadows would be cool.  More things like Basic Role-Playing?  I think I'll pass.<br/><br/>5 is sorta a push to look for social and not system-based solutions to play problems.  I wish he was a bit more specific about this idea of "broadening the playstyle" because that seems a little problematic.  If the game can only include the stuff that everyone really wants, it can be successful?  I'm not sure I quite see that, as yet.<br/><br/>6 is an awkward one for me.  It seems like a justification for the GM being able to overrule the players, unless that's somehow considered "being a bad GM" and therefore not considered part of the issue at all.  I guess I don't see what's threatening about a little player empowerment, but obviously Pundit feels differently, and that's cool.  Yay for being retro (though it seems like everyone's using some sort of resource-based narrative editing nowadays).<br/><br/>7-8 are, I guess, his attempt to try to differentiate himself from Ron. In my experience, I don't think Ron's ever claimed that GNS was more than one classification scheme based on specific things he observed in play.  So I guess I just see these two as an important basis of any theorizing, being the hippie relativist that I am.<br/><br/>So I guess I look at this and go: "Huh, this isn't really gonna be much different from (ironically) The Forge or Story Games after all, except maybe for the different people being involved."  Hopefully doing the same type of thing with a different crowd will give them interesting results.  I'm hopeful that some really cool stuff might develop.<br/><br/>Oh, and people are (of course) already arguing over the Landmarks in <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1504" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, which I'm in the middle of reading.                        </div>

                            Here's my take on his theories...<br/>
<br/>
1. Players enjoy the challenge, process, and/or potential for reward in the games they are playing, or they would stop playing them.<br/>
<br/>
2. Yes, otherwise they would stop playing it.<br/>
<br/>
3. The most popular games can not be defined as bad games, otherwise people would stop playing them.<br/>
<br/>
4. Players enjoy the challenge, process, and/or potential for reward in the games they are playing.  Players might enjoy a narrowly focused game, like Chess.  The might enjoy a game with a less than enjoyable process if the potential reward is great enough (eg. spending $ on the lottery). They may also enjoy games that are enjoyed on multiple levels, with different types of challenges and rewards.<br/>
<br/>
5. All players should understand the rules and goals of a game, and be happy with the game they are playing.  Differing rules, goals, narrowness and broadness have varying appeals to different individuals and groups.<br/>
<br/>
6. The level of narrative control given to players and the GM, whether there is a GM at all, or even to what degree roleplaying is part of the game has no bearing on whether a game is "good" or not.<br/>
<br/>
At this point we're starting to talk less about an overall game theory, and more about how to make a particular style of game.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that limiting players to the control of their characters, and leaving narrative control to the GM is a superior method to give players a sense of immersion in their character and the game world, than sharing greater narrative control between all the players.  If immersion is not an important goal of the game (perhaps it's wargaming strategy or collaborative storytelling) then the balance of narrative control could likely be different.<br/>
<br/>
7. Categorizing gamers into types is somewhat short-sighted as people can enjoy multiple types of games and styles of play, often during the same gaming session.<br/>
<br/>
8. Yes.  People who understand the rules and goals of a game should be able to play it despite it not being their favourite type of game.  A player may prefer storytelling games to strategy games, but you would not expect that they would make bad moves in a game of chess because "the Knight is in love with the Queen and wants to be nearer to her..." <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  People are capable of playing a wide variety of games, but must be agreeable to doing so.<br/>
<br/>
9. Absolutely.  Suggesting people don't understand when they are enjoying playing a game is somewhat absurd.  The only potential for confusion is if the players of a multi-faceted game have different ideas about what the goal of the game is, and are in fact playing different games at the same table.<br/>
<br/>
10. Genre Emulation and specifically Immersion (meaning character-immersion) can be the most important elements in an RPG.  Other games can offer superior challenges in other areas, but this is where a roleplaying game is unlike most other types of game.                        </div>

                            So, formally? Let's go ahead and deconstruct and all. And as always, promote no inter-board hate and the like. Heck, we can even frame it with, "What do the Landmarks bring to the table for Story Games/Story Gaming?" <br><br>So, first off, I'm fucking ecstatic that someone is creating a new theory/design powerhouse. Folks whine and bitch about how the tenets of Forge design are seeped in Ron Edwards' essays (even if the designers haven't read them and don't believe them!  ...but yeah, that's another story) about gamers being "mostly unhappy" and all that. So instead of continuing the whiny bitch train, folks have set up a camp, saying "Here we believe in something else. We have fundamentally differing opinions of how this stuff should work, and vow to make games seeped in our beliefs".  It's almost as refreshing a design goal as Chad Underkoffler's move to create Dead Inside ("Instead of killing people and taking their stuff, I designed a game where you heal people and give them stuff"). So, for that idea alone, I give them mad props.<br><br>The thing is, and I won't dwell on it (I'm not one of those "I swing absolutism to win arguments" types)... if the structure of the umbrella you work under is seeped in "The majority of gamers are having fun; the majority of gamers are satisfied with the majority of their game"; and the bit about D&amp;D being the Model Game... Then... er... what is there to design? More feats for D&amp;D? House rules? Games that look exactly like D&amp;D but aren't in some way? (ie the "Imagine RPG") Again, I'm not following this path to absolutism (like, "Therefore this can only result in..." etc), but 1, 2 and 3 generally seem to lead to, "Well shit guys, we're happy with what we've got. So let's just make up better houserules for what we have" instead of making something new.<br><br>Still, though, I'm really excited that there'd be another forum for gaming that acts as another powerhouse for game design. Sure, it might create "camps" or "schools" or "sides" in more shocking contrast/conflict with each other, much like academia does, but I'd love to see what the works of another camp with another fundamental viewpoint and membership can come up with, rather than "this one dude over here; that one dude over there".<br><br>So having said that, I'll give a once-through on the Landmarks in a sec.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            OK, similar to what others have said, with some minor differences:<br><br>1: Cool. This is a nice place to start. Most people who do anything find at least some kernel of pleasure in it, or with what it could be, otherwise, fuck, they'd stop, right?<br><br>2: OK, cool. Getting into more of relative-land here, but that's cool, cause the foundation of a belief system has to have a few of these beliefs. It does give the assumption that most people settle on One Game Only (Which is true; D&amp;D is King; but doesn't explain the majority of gamers on the Internet who play more than 1, more than 5, more than 10 games. Again, it's true, but it doesn't speak to a lot of us here, on RPGNet, heck or even half of EnWorld).<br><br>3: OK, again, good starting place for a tower-of-belief.  Personally, it's a Jenga tower ready to fall with a few simple metaphors:<br><b>"ARMEGEDDON is the model of what most people define as a movie, and therefore also the model for a successfully designed and produced movie. It can be improved upon or changed, but any theory that suggests that ARMAGEDDON as a whole (in any of its versions or cuts) was a "bad" movie is by definition in violation of My Theory. You don't have to say it is the "best" movie, but you are obviously not in touch with reality if your theory claims that ARMEGEDDON is a "bad" game, and then try to invent some convoluted conspiracy theory as to why millions of people watched it anyways, more than any other movie that year."</b><br><br>I liked the movie Armegeddon, personally (save for the "6 second scene syndrome"), but the above theory, rephrased with anything else (Replace RPG with "music" and D&amp;D with "MC Fergie" or "Jessica Simpson").<br><br>4: Huh, this is interesting, because I don't know any game "camp" that "speculates that games must be narrowly-focused to be "good" games" (even though he's clearly speaking of the Forge here).  Most people who write narrow-focus games, or play them, play them because they're Fun, not because they are tied to this "narrow=good" post. In much the same way in computer theory, we don't recommend the same tool for every job: Sometimes the big tool has to be reconfigured.  Most of the time, we construct or find a smaller tool that does just what we want it to.  I can't for the life of me understand how the fact that those kinds of games exist infuriates folks so.  However, as a Step in the Landmarks, I find it sort of a Red Herring. Up until this point, we had a solid framework to think about designing games, and all of a sudden we've got this shot on "Hey, don't tell us what we can and can't enjoy!".  "...oh-kayeee, we won't then." (Note to self: Find the Forge post where someone suggested that roleplayers would all be happier if they played narrowly-focused games)<br><br>5: OK, I see the start of getting back on track to a methodology/belief system here. Here, again, RPGpundit is thinking that most (or all) Forge games have narrow rules because without them the gaming table would be all chaos and rioting, and that these narrow rules prevent players from "going nuts" (ie rather than work on better table manners and interactions, these games codify this in the rules).  Every once in a while a rule hints at this kind of thing, but in most cases I see narrow rules as a way to focus a theme, not to limit players from being dicks. There's no drowning and falling rules in My Life With Master because the game isn't about drowning and falling, not to prevent someone from arguing about drowning and falling. Same reason there's no "fighting and takeover" rules in Catan. So again, I like the first sentence of number 5, and the last part of the last sentence, but the rest is a red-herring mini-tirade reacting to a misperception in small-press games that simply isn't there.<br><br/>6: Pundit states elsewhere re Number Six:
<blockquote>Number 6 is specifically a response to the Forge-mentality that GMs are the root of all evil and that players must be able to walk all over a GM or else the game won't be "fair" or "satisfying" to them.</blockquote>
Awesome. Well shit, I'm reacting to the World of Darkness-mentality that I have to eat ice cream 5 times a week! <br/><br/>...Huh?<br/><br/>Seriously, there are a few games where the GM is another player. It's because, for that game, the game itself works better if the GM is another player.  For example, Monopoly works better if there is One Banker (preferably me, because I steal money like a dog at Monopoly). Settlers of Catan works faster if Everyone is their Own Banker (ie takes their resources themselves). <br/><br/>It does add a sort of constrictive dogma to this belief system, which again can be refreshing (we all like constraints in our Game Chef contests, so why not adopt it for this theory as well): <b>All Games Developed Under This Banner Must Have A GM</b>. The rest of number six is all bollucks and red herring.<br/><br/>7: Cool. I mean, it doesn't get us any closer to writing our game, but hey, no biggie.<br/><br/>8: By this point, when I read "...is in violation of the Landmarks", I can't help but to hear that Asmovian female comfort-robot voice in my ear reciting the Laws of Robotics. But aside from that, sure, 8 builds on 7. This smells like a reaction again to a misperception, but whatever. (I am G! And you are S! Therefore we cannot play together!!). <br/><br/>9 + 10: Again, not really moving towards anything, rather these are saying "stop picking on me!". That's cool, not really productive but again it's fine.<br/><br/>So at the end of the day, only 1-3, part of 5, and 6 really work towards any basis of a belief system for creating new games. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I think all 4 is saying is that tight focus games are not necessarily better than broad focus games.  I don't think it is going on to say that broad focus games are better than tight focus ones.<br/><br/>I agree with that actually, I don't think tight focus is necessarily better and I don't think most gamers particularly want tight focus, I also don't think tight focus is worse.  I think tight focus is just tighter focus, with no value per se inherent in that for good or ill.  That said, if a tight focus game happens to focus on something you want then that rocks and that tight focus game will be a ton of fun.                        </div>

                            Oh, I don't think they add much to life.  I would broadly summarise them as saying:<br/><br/>GNS is crap and Ron Edwards ran over my dog.<br/><br/>Which may or may not be true, but I wouldn't use that as a basis for game design.  For a start, any resolution mechanic that depended on Ron running over dogs would attract animal rights group protests and would be difficult to implement for gamers outside the US.  Plus I like dogs, except maybe the little yappie ones.<br/><br/>Put bluntly, I don't think this is a model for designing games, it is simply a statement of models that cannot be used at that site for designing games.  It is a screening mechanism, not a foundation.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>I can see a RPG theory site paying homage to DnD.  It's influenced us all, directly or indirectly.  However, that is not where the theory begins.  Go back to the mid 90s to the newsgroups and to Gaming Outpost.  My guess would be both those things pre-date RPG pundit's presence on the 'net.  Anyway, his thoughts are very DnD centric and very complacent.  It's not what I would call a model for fostering discourse that challenges the status quo and innovates in new directions.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

<p>I think that the teaspoon of shit is that all games are necessarily modifications of D&amp;D and must be viewed in that light.  In that light, for instance, My Life With Master is a bad game, because it really is a terrible modification of D&amp;D.  But, so is Chess.  Or, you know, hiking in the forest.</p>

<p>You know, I have to say Pundit is right about one thing: it is a mistake to decide, in a GM-and-players situation, to decide that  players must have absolute power just because the GM can be a dick. One of the most frustrating things about reading him is, of course, that he is blind to the fact that his own position, that the GM must have ultimate power because players can be dicks, is just as big of a mistake. Neither position prevents dickery; indeed, both positions encourage it.</p>
<p>And I'm not convinced that the world has seen enough Dogs in the Vineyard play, for an alleged example, to say for sure that players don't have enough power in the game to abuse it. Maybe we never will, just because the game selects culturally for people who are bought into story already. But the principle stands.</p>
<p>Which games have we seen that acknowledge that dickery cannot be prevented by rules, and really make that a cornerstone of the design? ...but I don't think that's really the heart of the problem either. I suppose simply throwing up your hands system-wise with regard to the dickery issue is a valid approach, but I think there's another vein of system to be mined, one orthogonal to both sides of the power struggle.</p>
<p>I'm sure this isn't a new idea, but: role-playing games are dominance-and-submission games. Not metaphorically, but actually. Maybe the whole problem in problematic play is we don't know we're playing power play, and therefore don't think to have safewords. Or any of the other tried-and-true safety practices of the BDSM community, such as caring about one another to begin with.</p>

His arguments amount to bald statements that <em>"you [Swine] are totally wrong"</em>, backed up with logical fallacies (mostly <em>cum hoc</em> arguments and <em>ad hominem</em> attacks). I honestly don't know where he gets off on it, except perhaps that he's built a considerable online persona as the RPGPundit and he likes how the response to his bilious rhetoric makes him feel. It is sound and fury signifying nothing. Don't expect a logically consistent response - expect an articulate bout of bombast filled with rhetorical devices intended to get you to shut up.<br/><br/>Indulge if you will, but it is an indulgence akin to hunting down goatse.cx pictures to shock your brain with brutality (although that's no doubt the subject of some idiot's thesis, somewhere), or maybe like debating gender politics with Fred Phelps.

<p>Generally agreed. He's momentarily infected me with his power obsession. Still, I wonder if there are some good design thoughts to be mined out of this. I'd go read some more about BDSM right now but I'm logged in at a cafe and, well, certain things I'm just not gonna Google here.</p>

You basically said what I was thinking, only more eloquently. If some neat games come out of this I'll be all over them like I would any other neat games, but so far peeking at the forums reminds me of that adage about the making of sausages and laws.                        </div>

                            Something that Andy said struck me - that the Landmarks aren't any sort of platform for building things on - at least not new or innovative things.  They basically amount to an appeal to the vox populi as authority: this is the most popular, so this is where we start work.  Never mind that D&amp;D has been the starting platform since its inception.<br/><br/>There's just nothing *new* or even vaguely *different* that can come out of the Landmarks.<br/><br/>Chillingly, the AGE Model actually stands up to their acid test.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  OK, so I don't agree with Pundit 100%, but I can see where he is coming from:<br/>
1) Basically means, don't post here if you think gaming today is disfunctional and you have come to fix it. Personally, I think that there is a group of indie designers out there that beleive that some amount of players are just going through the motions trying to re-discover that thrill they felt the first time they played a good session of roleplaying. I think that that is unfortunate as it basically mandates certain design techiniques and precludes other out of hand.<br/>
2) Basically means, don't design a game because you are unhappy and you want to fix it for yourself and others. Design a game if you want to make an improvement or fill the minority gap not filled by the successful games. Personally, I think that this is pretty accurate. I think that games like ditv shows that the minority can prove to be very profitable and effective. But they are never going to de-throne the games that are already successful. I think Pundits view is a little over stated, but not much. I don't think its really aimed at Forge-ites as much as new eager designers that think they will write the next D&amp;D and then go buy their own island, but it is still a pretty valid point...<br/>
3) I think he is sayting that a lot of communication can be improved if you take a step back and recognize that you can use D&amp;D as a lingua franca to communicate with other players and designers. In some small way I agree. I think that the tendancey to try too hard to be different from D&amp;D and the efforts made to re-invent the terminology is distracting and counter-productive to communicating your own theories and designs ideas. Don't misunderstand me. When the day is done, you have to make a game that is uniqely your own. But, don't throw out the baby with the bath water...<br/>
4) I think he is saying, asking "What is your game about?" is not necesarily a step at improving someone elses game. Not every game has to have a central theme to be a good game. Basically, he wants to ascert that you can't lable a game as good or bad based on whether the game tackles issues or themes. I think that taken at face value, this is mostly true. Of course, I would say the opposite is true as well, You can't say a generic game is better than a narrowly defined game.<br/>
5) I think this boils down to just because a play session goes bad, that doesn't mean that there is something wrong with the game being played at the time. And again, I would mostly agree. System does matter, but system may not cause happiness or unhappiness. I mean, System can make you pay attention to something you don't care about. But, system cannot make you get into a fight with your friend, can it?<br/>
6) I think 6 boils down to two things: one, don't tear D&amp;D (or other successful games) down to pump up your game and two, you can't tell if a game is good or bad just by asking if it has a GM. Personaly, I think the question, "does your game really need a GM" is overplayed. I get why it is asked, but it almost has too much currency. don't get me wrong, I think GM-less games can be a great source of fun and I have written one. But, i don't think knowing that a game has a GM is an indicator one way or the other if a game is good.<br/>
7) This is obviously aimed at GNS specifically, but it is worded to apply to old school player types like Macho vs. Looney, etc. And I think the point of the rule is to prevent dogma wars. I think its a good idea, I mean how much time has been wasted trying to determine if a game is for X type of player or what X type of player likes, doesn't like can play with, what it actually means, etc.<br/>
8) This is just re-inforcing 7, don't come in here and say All players are either G, N or S and never the twain shall meet. And I tend to agree. I think GNS has a place in RPG theory, but I think that the terms Gamism, Narrativism and Simulationism were poorly chosen and poorly defined with stilted language. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't make the theory invalid, it just makes it hard to communicate and use effectively.<br/>
9) I think he is just trying to say, don't kid yourself, D&amp;D players have fun. You can make another kind of fun, but don't try and say its the first kind of RPG fun ever created.  Seems like he is just re-stating 1 &amp; 2, but at least he's consistant. Again, I think there are players that wish A was better or wish B was better, but few players who are saying to themselves, "this is total crap, but I'll keep playing and see if it gets better"<br/>
10) Is just saying that it is possible to create a consistant game world and play in character. Again, I can agree with that. I don't think this one is aimed at the forge-ites, and I don't think he means hardcore immersion like in LARPs or whatever, but I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
  I can't say I would word it like that or that I agree 100%. But, I can see, and respect, where he is coming from.<br/>

                            The most glaring point in all of that seems to be his use of "gamers", by which he seems to be talking only about a very self-selected group of long-term or intense hobbyists. Under those terms, he's probably right on most points, but since he seems to have selected out a humongorous amount of people with that definition, the rest of his points become very suspect.<br/><br/>I've also noticed that he takes a pretty a-historical approach, never taking into account factors outside of the game itself to account for anything at all.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't see his approach very likely to produce anything more than "More of the Same, only bigger, sold to the same exact people".<br/><br/>Meh. Okay, but that doesn't fit with my interests, so...                        </div>

True and all. And again, while I'm pretty dismissive of Nisarg overall, again the rest of the site (the "non-swine" parts) seem relaxed and cool.

                            Nisarg's shitty attitude is telling though. He simultaneously shows fear of and dismissal of the little indie games. Old time minis gamers had a similar reaction to D&amp;D and its early successors. Hell, that's why they're called rpgs, and not wargames.<br/><br/>To me that says that he's aware that rpgs as a hobby are trending towards a direction he doesn't like, and also that more narra styled mechanics may be a viable successor/competitor for hobbyist hearts and minds.                        </div>

                            Things I think designers can learn from D&amp;D:<br/>
<br/>
1) Having a mechanism where players are improving their in-game position over time is powerful. So powerful, that you can literally make a game where nothing else of interest is happening (Diablo). "Level Up!"<br/>
2) "Level Up" provides a default goal for players. People who have no interest in engaging deeply with the creative aspects of the game can grab hold of this goal and have fun with the others. When creativity flags, a player can fall back on this as a spur to action. And players are still free to create and pursue other goals for themselves.<br/>
3) Having a GM-created and controlled world lends a weight of verisimilitude to the proceedings that an obviously impromptu setting does not. Players can explore and feel that they are making "real" discoveries. Players improve their in-game position and feel they have created something "real."<br/>
4) GM-privleged power distribution means that one person can fudge, provide on-the-fly content, and nudge the action toward areas of high awesome-potential without lifting the veil of verisimilitude.<br/>
5) A GM-privleged responsibility distribution means that one talented person with an agenda of providing awesome potential for everyone can make a game a success for everyone. Some other models need everyone to step up or else the game falls flat.<br/>
6) Particularly in its magic system, D&amp;D provides an enormous complexity and breadth of pre-determined "handles" for the player. A player can explore this space and find something for his character to do in a given situation. He is left with the cool feeling that he invented a clever and unique solution. And because he found this solution among a pre-determined maze of possibilites, it feels more "real" than if he had been allowed to riff any solution at all.                        </div>

                            I think you guys are spending way too much time worrying about this to be honest.<br/><br/>If you screen out the random chunks of hate I think there is something to some of the landmarks as a screening tool.  There is no point in repeating the Forge, the Forge already does a great job.  If the site is ever to produce other theories there is little purpose in it trying to reinvent a wheel that is already extremely well served elsewhere.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Nisarg consciously models himself on Hunter S Thompson.  Accordingly, if you go there he will not be interested in reasoned debate on a level playing field, that's not the game at hand there.  <br/><br/>So, if you have an interest in the other stuff on the site, which I think is generally not bad at all, that's a good reason to go there.  If you feel like getting down and dirty for the sake of a good punch up, well that's your call I guess, but that too would be a good reason to go there.  If you wish as an exercise to indulge in game design without using any Forge theory, well, to be honest I would suggest the rpg.net design forum as I don't think there is anyone much on the site there with that much interest in using that forum for rpg design.<br/><br/>There are designers there, FlyingMice has been pretty successful as an indie game designer and does his thing well, S John Ross is very successful, but neither as far as I can see is using that forum to develop their ideas.<br/><br/>Nisarg hates the Forge with a bright and singular passion which, IMO, is a tribute to the success of that site in disseminating its ideas across the web.  Take that as the compliment it is, engage with the other bits of the site as they interest you, throw yourselves into the bearpit if you find that diverting, but I seriously recommend you do not go to that particular forum with the intent of calmly and sensibly explaining Forge derived theories.  It's like going to the Peta forums and trying to explain the perspective of hunting afficionados, you may or may not have good points but you are unlikely to get a sympathetic hearing.                        </div>

I think that's the point.  What Nisarg wants is to build better versions of trad rpgs, he has negative (rather than zero) interest in creating stuff that is new or different.<br/><br/>So, if you want to create a new rpg which feels a bit like the computer game Elite, that's fine.  If you want to create a new type of rpg experience, then get thee to the outer darkness.<br/><br/>Put another way, you are absolutely right but Nisarg sees that not as a bug but a feature.  Then again, if you want to create new types of rpg, why would you need something beyond the Forge and the blogoverse?  The support for that is out there.  I'm not convinced the support for trad design is there at the rpgsite, but that's Nisarg's problem if that is something he wants the site to do.<br/><br/>Which I doubt, I think that forum is about ranting about dirty hippie games more than anything else.                        </div>

                            Listen to Bruce Baugh regarding Nisarg. I think it has little to do with the Forge or its position and everything to do with Nisarg and his personality.<br/><br/>I found it amusing how he said until recently he probably wasn't mature enough, when it seems he'd been at what he is for years.                        </div>

                            Hey Jonathan, <br/><br/>I was being sarcastic, which is always hit and miss with just words.  I'm all about differing opinions and competing ideas, but I draw the line when civil discourse breaks down, which it does when anybody calls me a swine in advance.  <br/><br/>There's a preacher in Durham who is having a book burning tomorrow, and the local paper is giving him a couple of column inches, and it makes me sad for the same reason this thread does.                        </div>

If the game can only include the stuff that everyone really wants, it can be successful?  I'm not sure I quite see that, as yet.<br/></blockquote>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>Oh, I don't think they add much to life.  I would broadly summarise them as saying:<br/><br/>GNS is crap and Ron Edwards ran over my dog.<br/><br/>Which may or may not be true, but I wouldn't use that as a basis for game design.  For a start, any resolution mechanic that depended on Ron running over dogs would attract animal rights group protests and would be difficult to implement for gamers outside the US.
