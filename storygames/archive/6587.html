It bills itself as a "Role Card Game", and the website is kind of poorly translated from French.  It looks like a very high-production-value take on an idea that's been floating around for a while - a trading card role playing game.  If this was good, I'd be really excited by it, but looking over the few cards that are online, I see a lot of big numbers and crunchy-looking gameplay, which is the opposite of what I want from this kind of thing.  <br/><br/>Does anyone know any more than me?<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Simon                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160562/#Comment_160562" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T07:49:52+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  7:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a few reviews of the game on BoardGameGeek.com that mainly talk about it as a card/dice battle game. I think one of the main ideas is your deck builds your character the same as numbers and words on a character sheet. There are expansions that take you through specific challenges/areas of Corunea, kinda the same way the Raid Decks do for WoW TCG. <br/><br/>I've requested a review copy from the company in the hopes of looking at the game more from a story-games perspective. I will let you know if I hear back from them.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
