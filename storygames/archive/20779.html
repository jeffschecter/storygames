But there's really as much homage to other games I like in it as there's original creation of my own.<br/><br/>The thing with swords &amp; sorcery is, once you're really into it, there's so many different ways to do it. So I don't have so much as a single favorite - rather, there's games which do it well, but each is really its own sub-genre:<br/><br/>The best thing about <b>Swords Without Master</b> is, the way a session of play is paced you're bound to have a lot of threads left hanging in the end, which both invites more play <i>and</i> feels just that little bit "off" - fitting with the wildest, weirdest examples of the genre. The best games of it, in my opinion, are those which start from some place, then take a wildly far-fetched spin spun from some apparently minor thread and ride with it all the way into either a cosmically crazy bang of an ending or a sedate, barely satisfactory non-ending.<br/>This is the best "Fafhrd and Gray Mouser" game.<br/>A problem with it? That it's built for 3-4 rogue players (plus overplayer), but 3 rogues is already too many main characters for a S&amp;S story. I suggest trying it with two rogues, despite this setup yielding fewer options in the Perilous phase.<br/><br/>I carry a torch for <b>On Mighty Thews</b>, too. It's got, in my opinion, the best all-purpose swords-and-sorcery magic subsystem ever, with its Lore Rolls. The personality traits as map poles are another genius idea, reinforcing from the very beginning that the game's about psycho-weird-trip swords and sorcery. I recommend playing with 2 PCs + GM -- or, if you have 3-4 PCs, agree on such a starting situation that they're not all friends and sworn companions but rather rivals (friendly or otherwise) over a same goal.<br/>This is the best "Elric" game, I think.<br/>Simon's newer s&amp;s game <b>Nod</b> is also <i>very</i> interesting and I want to play it again! Like in my own EtA, it tries to capture the feeling of a s&amp;s with a single main character, while emphasizing the role of "secondary" characters as potential protagonists. It's brilliant in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>One-hero stories, by the way, are done beautifully by <b>S/lay w/Me</b>. Obviously the best "Conan" game so far. To fully appreciate it, I think it's <i>really</i> important to play multiple sessions with the same partner - exchanging roles but, especially, getting to play at least one sequel story with the same main character. This really is a game of long-term (well, medium-term) character development, and this might not be obvious in the moment. Also, this game is actually better with a modicum of sexual tension between the two players than it is without... Like, if at all possible, elect to play it with a friend you find at least a little attractive.<br/><br/>[to be continued when I manage to]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456425/#Comment_456425" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-21T11:41:39+00:00" title="September 21, 2016 11:41AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2016 11:42AM by Rafu.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>In a Wicked Age</b> is full of genius details. Compared to the other games above - but maybe it's just me - it sets me toward a more primal, visceral mood. Less space-time weirdness, more in-the-flesh. Less focus on the saga of individual rogue-wanderers, even more focus on the cultures they inhabit. Maybe I need to go read some Tanith Lee?<br/>It's impossible to really appreciate this game as a one-shot, because the world-building part mostly happens in the medium/long term.<br/><br/>I'm currently play[testing] <b>Freebooting Venus</b>, Vincent Baker's ouvre of pseudo-Vancian writing, and I'm having a riot. Don't expect this to be close in mood to IaWA just because it's from the same author! Vincent is a very versatile creator, even within the swords &amp; sorcery meta-genre. Maybe unsurprisingly, this is as close as you can get to "Jakko Orange, the role-playing game".<br/><br/>Each of the above games is a wholly different beast - and not just in terms of the techniques they use. In my humble opinion, each stands on its own as its own "genre" under the umbrella term "swords and sorcery" and is extremely well developed as such. I'm sure there are others around!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456427/#Comment_456427" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-21T12:57:11+00:00" title="September 21, 2016 12:57PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2016 1:31PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Hey, I'm pretty proud of that game, for a number of reasons!

I suppose because of the touch of intro text about the brother, I read the game description very seriously, and with a great sense of ... foreboding, might be the word. I didn't place it in a genre so much as see the uncertainty of vengeance highlighted sharply. It felt too serious for me to regard it as a game at all.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456472/#Comment_456472" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-22T07:39:06+00:00" title="September 22, 2016  7:39AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, thank you for reading through it.<br/>Yes, there is actually a story of coping with personal trauma behind the act of writing that particular game... but, very importantly, the game as is, with its SnS flavor and flavor text, <i>embodies the coping</i>, not the trauma. It's really meant to be a fun game to play, and my experience is it usually is.<br/>You can probably figure I've played and facilitated it a zillion times, including with friends and with people I'd just met, with hardcore storygamers and roleplaying grognards, with experienced but casual role-players and with absolute first timers, ranging from age 14 to age 50. I was sometimes a scary horror story, sometimes gleefully indulging in gore, sometimes light-hearted or even whimsical, and a couple times of course it was a messy and boring failure, but believe me, it was always some shade of swords and sorcery. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
