                    I'd love to hear Story Gamers' experiences with Birthright.<br/><br/>What rocked, what didn't and how the system backed it up.<br/><br/>I was in the middle of writing 1st Quest and this other TSoY-inspired thing vomitted out and it seems to be born from conversations with a buddy of mine about a Birthright game he was in and what I always thought Birthright should be.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks for sharing...                </div>

                            so, there were these two games in the box. One was a fairly standard fantasy rpg with a darkly toned world, and the other was some kind of 'settlers of a fantasy world' like management simulation.<br/><br/>While the characters had some cool tie-ins to the game world (all the nobles being infused by homeopathic amounts of divine blood), they also had tie-ins into the management simulation stats wise. <br/><br/>At first and second glance, this looked like a cool idea. Adventures could spring from what happened with one's piece of land, and the result of adventures could have fed back into the management game.<br/><br/>For some reason I cannot entirely grasp, in practice, synergy was expected but didn't emerge from the game.<br/><br/>Some cool points: It was possible to make one's "duchy" or whatever thrive on art and culture (a nod to the bards of d&amp;d) instead of masses of people and civilization (humans) or magic and nature (elves). So, one pat of the game tried to encompass non-D&amp;D core themes. <br/><br/>Besides this, I remember the halfling with their shadow-walk ability seemed a bit silly, as this wasn't explained in the life time of the setting. I liked the idea  that most big name monsters were just people who got too much of the blood divine (a very tsoy-like topic: no monsters, no gods, just people). I didn't like the idea of blood stealing (seemed like a nod to vampire that was totally unnecessary). I liked the toned-down magic users.                        </div>

                            Yeh...there was no synergy whatsoever, and I don't really remember why. Me and my players really <i>wanted</i> it, but we couldn't make it happen. We ended up playing the card-based mass combat game basically all the time, which the players always won because they had griffin riders, and the "evil army" had nothing that could stand up to them. <br/><br/>The cool: the big monsters were the product of too much god-blood, and the same could happen to the characters; the whole system for determining what happened in your kingdom each month (i think one turn was one gameworld month) had interaction with your characters stats and had a cool linked system of tables to roll on; character creation was "well, you're all descendents of the gods, lets go from there"<br/><br/>The uncool: no idea how to play the game that the text promised was in there; weird variations on the standard D&amp;D 2nd Ed. rules that were hard to remember and didn't make much intuitive sense; the bigname monsters were so powerful that it would take years of real-time play to get your characters into their league (maybe not literally, but thats how it seemed at the time).                        </div>

                            Birthright was almost a complete merge of "Master of Magic", a PC game that was out and about before Birthright, with AD&amp;D2e.  <br/><br/>I, too, was hot on how it claimed to be: Strategic card-based battles on a map unnervingly similar to a smaller gridmap ala Master of Magic. PC movers-and-shakers in the Nobility, Priest, Thief and Fighter castes, each with their own special abilities. Together, they can form a council and really shake the realm with Big Decisions.  <br/><br/>But I never really saw that happen in any of the demos I played of it.  It was always Adventuring Powerful Core Class Members with some hereditary superpowers. Kicking in doors, killing orcs, stealing pie, then meeting back at the castle to discuss the next threat to the realm.<br/><br/>It could really use some Awesome-O-Fying, but I'm afraid that it would require basically finishing the game that the Birthright creator started; a lot of work.<br/><br/>But some things to pull out of it for TSOY:<br/>* A mini-game of strategy and battlefield tactics. One would almost say "Use Command and Color Ancients, ans somehow find a way to tie stuff into TSOY"<br/><br/>* Hereditary Secrets, magical abilities, etc. Things from glowing eyes to Natural Leadership<br/><br/>* Less focus on 'kill the orc' adventuring, more focus on West Wing style politics, then leading armies into neighboring nations or using your influence to work from the shadows.... and only THEN dive into the dungeon and kill the orcs.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            The one big failing (which seemed to be the origin of the disconnects we ran into) was that the system never really had any useful model for vassalage.  Excepting a handful of lieutenants, these holdings and resources you held were so abstracted that there was no real sense of having _faces_ attached to them in the form of people, like knights or priests, who actually ran thing son the ground, but were loyal to you.  That lack really hurt when it came time to tie it all in.<br/><br/>That said, something that really worked is best illustrated by a story from a friend's game (Fred's I think).  Having done the dungeon crawl thing, thye got to the end and, voila, there's the treasure, per usual.  But because this is Birthright, that treasure _came from_ somewhere - it wasn't just found money - and it was ultimately more appeallign to the players to _give it back_ to the ruler from whom it had been stolen in order to cement a relationship with him.  That fucking ruled.<br/><br/>Notably, Birthright also did something with the humanoids that deserves note: They were cultures,  which had its own politics and motivations.  Eberron has gone on to explore htis idea a little more fully, but it was pretty solid and between that (and the fact that they rolled most of the dungeon-humanoids into one race, the Orogs) managed to do more of a job of feeling like they had a place in the setting.<br/><br/>Lastly, I totally jammed on the named monsters.  Sure, they were neatly symbolic and they gave a great setting-reason for boss fights, but they also were specatularily well motivated by their role in the setting.  Sure, the A-list baddies of the setting (Gorgon, Raven, Serpent, The White Which and the Kraken) were incredibly powerful, but they weren't just out rampaging gojira-style. They had agendas, as did all the lower tiers of critters.  As a whole,  they could be talked to, and that made a huge difference for me<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Some great comments here. I was initially impressed with the game, but found a real game of political intrigue proved too much. An amibitious leader and you've suddenly got to keep track of dozens of kingdoms and all the Regency Points or whatever they were called. It got bewildering over time, a little overwhelming trying to figure who was at stake and who was getting involved in the conflict and what they were willing to spend to intervene. It turned into a giant exercise in math.<br/><br/>My second issue was the ability to improve your Kingdom. You could take actions that would increase the wealth and power of your kingdom over time but then the focus came on min/maxing your kingdom and treating it like a character. Not that I think being able to make improvements is wrong, but rather the way it was carried out kept the focus on the rating for that province. It was one quantifiable number that people tended to fixate on.<br/><br/>Third, there was this Highlander/Vampire Bloodline thing going on which wasn't so cool. Killing people to power up.<br/><br/>Fourth, a random table of problems or events you roll on. There wasn't much of a structure to the game. You adventure around, guided by a few random rolls. I'd like to have seen some sort of thematic structure to it: a campaign or a couple of adventures make up Spring or Winter and at the end you explore the consequences or your decisions upon the people of your nation.<br/><br/>I dunno, I've always wanted to play this sort of game but I've never seen it executed correctly. I know you've toyed around with this idea before, with a Sorcerer variation, so I'm excited to see you mulling over it again!                        </div>

                            I really enjoyed the setting. But not the style of play that Birthright was intended for. In the end, we simply used it as background to the campaign.                        </div>

                            Ahhhh Birthright...  My old foe...  We drifted all over the fucking place with that game...  The macro game was broken, the micro game was broken...<br/><br/>I mean why the fuck would you go searching for artifacts or some shit when you have a fucking army?  You got men, fucking send them to get shit done.  That is why they are there.<br/><br/>When we played it we either had everyone heads of rival factions with a country or rival heads of states.  Lots of note passing and back room deals and shit (as the DM only saw what was on the notes after the night ended cause I read them after everyone left).  We built our rule set on the spot cause the system for that shit was so damn broken.  We dumped classes and characters all together outside their base stats.  I mean who gives a fuck if the king can use a sword or not?<br/><br/>We built a larger table of random world events and as the DM I rolled from a random action table for all the kingdoms near the player run places.  The upkeep was a bitch for me as DM and I wish we had thought of a better way to track all that kinda shit.<br/><br/>As the initial game went on (the one that became out template for future Birthright games) character sheets turned into a name, base stats of the ruler, regency points, lists of shit he has his fingers in, his retainers and their loyalty to him, and any other resources.  The only thing we really used from the game as it went on was the battle cards, and even those were modified to reflect changes in the game.<br/><br/>The notion of the monsters as unique was cool and all, but really had no fucking place in a political drama.  We kept the regents, but dumped any notion of the non-regent monsters existing at all.<br/><br/>The whole shadow world (which was later fleshed out in an online only supplement during the dying days of TSR) thang we fucking ignored.  We dumped halflings and dwarves from the game entirely (bringing the underground Orog and Dwarf kingdoms to the surface) cause they suck ass.  Elves and their kingdoms took on this Byzantine feel as play went on (dying remnants of an old empire that has seen better days).<br/><br/>Man I wish I still had the map we used.  We went so far as to scan and print on a plotter the map and then made changes as events happened.  If I remember correctly the world ended up split in four spheres of influence.  The Raven (who I played to the fucking hilt and used as the big bad cause the Gorgon was a pussy), who dominated the Germanic and Slavic dudes, the two Player spheres of influence who fought each other almost as much as they fought me (this was split between 6 constant players and 2 others who played once in a while as guest rulers) and the Elves who played both sides against the middle (who I would have a non-gaming friend who liked listening to the AAR dictate to me what they should be doing).<br/><br/>So Birthright inspired some of the most fun and frustration we ever experienced in gaming.  I love the fucking thing to death, but man did it suck too...                        </div>

                            I played Birthright both face to face and by email for years. Those games were consistently awesome.<br/>
<br/>
The extra layer of domain rules on top of AD&amp;D2 gave us an extra scope of play. You weren't just heroes, and you weren't just kings, you were hero kings, and we got both layers of fun to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Managing your kingdom was vaguely boardgamey. There were lots of entities that were in play, including various political figures, physical properties, army units, roads, and so on that could be interacted with, and the play of domain actions was itself enough to be an interesting game.<br/>
<br/>
But then you also got to play your character. There were various events to attend, political intrigue, etc. If you felt like strapping on some armor and going monster killing, that was available fun, too.<br/>
<br/>
When we played around the table, our characters were the focus of the fun. We also played the domain game, and that gave us jumping off points for character fun, but the majority of play time was spent being your guy.<br/>
<br/>
When we played by email, and later, by forum, the majority of the game was the domain game. This was probably something like playing Diplomacy or a similar country game by email, really. The game lent itself really well to distributed play, actually, since your characters were also distributed. Communicating with other kings by email was fine, because in the fiction, you were communicating with them by courier.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I think play benefited from the synergy of the two styles of play. When you were "playing your guy", you still had plot hooks and settings and background and so on from your kingdom. When you were in "playing your kingdom" mode, you still had a guy who was your voice, and you could roleplay him and his reactions to various kingdom-level events.<br/>
<br/>
Then only part of the game that really did nothing for me was the blood abilities. Bloodtheft almost never came up in our games, and I could take or leave the blood abilities, the two parts of the game would have been equally as fun without them.                        </div>

                            One criticism I had heard about Birthright was too much focus on aggressive expansion as a way to gain power. There didn't seem to be a good way of increasing your power without taking someone else's lands.<br/><br/>It has been a long, long time since I actually played, and I didn't play that much to begin with, so I have no idea how accurate that is. But I know I've heard more than one person give that same complaint.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>

                            I never really got into Birthright, having become interested just as it imploded and died. However, is there any way of getting hold of the rules these days, apart from the ubiquitous ebay?<br/>
