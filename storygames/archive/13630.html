A question.<br/><br/>"The Shadow of Yesterday" sounds like it could have been a fitting title (although maybe a little too romantic-sounding) for "Apocalypse World". Both are story games with a strong connection to the "traditional" gaming many of us have known and loved.<br/><br/>Imagine you and your group playing a game of Apocalypse World. Now imagine that you rewound time and started the very same game again, but this time using the rules for The Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System. Now you have to parallel universes where you have the same players playing the same characters, but using these two rather different systems.<br/><br/>How do the two games look different? How does game A feel different from game B? Who dies and who lives? What different choices are the players confronted with?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307999/#Comment_307999" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T07:35:44+00:00" title="January 13, 2011  7:35AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, jeez, for one thing, my Skinner probably wouldn't have come up with her idea for a daycare, and our Brainer probably wouldn't have brokered that divorce between the mayor and the leader of the wasteland gang. <br/>I dunno - I get the feeling that we would have been a bit more informed as to how our characters comported themselves, but less informed as to what their <i>capabilities</i> are. <br/>We've only had the one session so far - thus, it's hard to tell, hard to make a big inference.

Apocalypse World also encourages character growth and change (through new moves and especially the appeal of taking new playbooks) that's similar to TSoY's character arcs and acquisition of new Secrets.<br/><br/>In addition, from what I've heard, the whole Transcendence mechanic sounds like it's present in AW, and at about the same game point (5-6 sessions for a quickly advancing character). The characters fight against a world full of trouble, but as the game progresses they quickly develop into forces of protagonism, and eventually "outgrow" the setting. In TSoY, it means changing the world. In AW, changing the world means making people you care about safe ("allies") and then "retiring to safety". I see a lot of parallels.<br/><br/>And I have a suspicion that the prep methods for TSoY and AW are easily interchangeable--either game may work quite well with the other's GM style.<br/><br/>Jamie,<br/><br/>The sex moves and highlighting are clear departures, indeed! Good point.\\<br/><br/>Dave,<br/><br/>Hey, maybe we should?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308270/#Comment_308270" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T14:23:11+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  2:23PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... is that it?
