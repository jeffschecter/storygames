On the one hand are games like <i>Burning Wheel</i> and <i>HeroQuest</i>.  On the other are retrogaming "old school" stuff like <i>Storming the Wizards Tower</i> and OSRIC and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd looking over some modules and old maps I was reminded of how little sense, in a purely logical way, that dungeons and mega-dungeons really make.  The ecology doesn't work.  The aeons old traps don't make sense -- who fixes them?  The anachronistic humor doesn't work.<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept that it kind of does, and it's obviously fun, since so many of us spent so much time hammering away in games like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut because of the "Recommend games for some young girls" thread (wherein I suggested looking at <i>Seven Leagues</i>) in parallel with the "let's make a solo dungeon"/what system should we use?" threads, it occurs to me that in a very real sense, "old school dungeons" are a kind of Mystic Otherworld in the literary/fairy tale/Hero with a 1000 Faces kind of way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdventurers enter them, interact with the strange denizens -- who often don't make sense or are otherwise impossible -- puzzle through their strange riddles, and then meet their doom or win fame, fortune, and magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure I'm not the first person to think of this, but I think it might be an interesting approach to do something like that explicitly with a system more like <i>Seven Leagues</i> than, say, <i>Labyrinth Lord</i> or <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I making any kind of sense?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190271/#Comment_190271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T12:53:02+00:00" title="January 27, 2009 12:53PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, perfect sense. There is a way that dungeons correspond to that underworld the hero has to go through. I always think of Dante's Inferno in this regard. It could be that this is a face of dungeons that's hardly been explored yet. I'd like to see what kind of dungeon exploration you'd get from a game designed to facilitate fairy tales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190282/#Comment_190282" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T13:08:44+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  1:08PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you haven't read it:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: <a href="http://www.philotomy.com/#dungeon" rel="nofollow">Philotomy</a></cite><br>There are many interpretations of "the dungeon" in D&amp;D. OD&amp;D, in particular, lends itself to a certain type of dungeon that is often called a "megadungeon" and that I usually refer to as "the underworld." There is a school of thought on dungeons that says they should have been built with a distinct purpose, should "make sense" as far as the inhabitants and their ecology, and shouldn't necessarily be the centerpiece of the game (after all, the Mines of Moria were just a place to get through). None of that need be true for a megadungeon underworld. There might be a reason the dungeon exists, but there might not; it might simply be. It certainly can, and perhaps should, be the centerpiece of the game. As for ecology, a megadungeon should have a certain amount of verisimilitude and internal consistency, but it is an underworld: a place where the normal laws of reality may not apply, and may be bent, warped, or broken. Not merely an underground site or a lair, not sane, the underworld gnaws on the physical world like some chaotic cancer. It is inimical to men; the dungeon, itself, opposes and obstructs the adventurers brave enough to explore it. ...<br><br><a href="http://www.philotomy.com/#dungeon" rel="nofollow">Read the whole thing</a><br/></br></br></br></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190285/#Comment_190285" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T13:19:19+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  1:19PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's sort of oblique to your point, but a lot of people have the computer RPG Persona 3/Persona 4 on the mind. They weren't revolutionary, but they were cool in that you are a person living in the real world and doing real-world things... yet at night you and your friends go to the Surreal Place at the Appropriate Time: The world falls away, and you enter a bizarre dungeon-tower filled with monsters that need killin' and labyrinths that need explorin'. I ran a similar campaign using Unknown Armies a few years ago involving another plane that the players could visit (lifted straight out of Clive Barker's imagination). <br><br>I think the modern setting makes it that much more effective, since the strangeness of it makes it feel even that much more unreal. I've got a thing for "other dimensions".<br><br>You could effectively do the same thing with a fantasy world, too: The normal world is all peasants and castles, but at certain places in the world, there are gates to other dimensions, which lead to places created by madmen, gods, and mad gods. Maybe clearing them out and "defeating" them weakens their hold on the world, causing them to disappear forever when the PCs leave.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190342/#Comment_190342" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-27T19:40:41+00:00" title="January 27, 2009  7:40PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton -- I had not seen that, and it's exactly what I was thinking about.

That sounds quite similar to what Andy is talking<br>\nabout - gates to other dimensions. In the Enshrouded Lands the Fey Realm is one<br>\nvast, connected realm, but here's the rub:- buildings etc. materialise over time in the <br>\nFey Realm as copies of buildings in the Mortal Realm.

I'm not quite sure what they would eat, maybe they have to serve the<br/>\ngreater teleporting beings who can bring them food, or maybe there's a tunnel<br/>\ndown to an underground stream with a few fish or something, or maybe there<br/>\nare magical artefacts which summon creatures into the castle to become food...<br/>\n<br/>\nmaybe that's how the player characters get there - summoned there, for food???<br/>\n<br/>\nThis could be quite a funky way to use my *serious roleplay* setting for a bit<br/>\nof light-hearted if slightly scary dungeon-bashing...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190382/#Comment_190382" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T06:16:55+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  6:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In fact I think I'm going to run this adventure next month!<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
