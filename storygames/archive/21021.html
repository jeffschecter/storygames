I liked it.<br/><br/>Best is the setup part: the game is providing a lot of randomized input toward creating one's kingdom, so no blank-page issues, but all those pieces of input tend to be broadly interpretable as well. It has that "randomize a pool of characters, then pick from them" thing going on - similar in a way to IaWA - that I really like. And that "write down several syllables" thing, for fantasy naming conventions: brilliant! I've ended up stealing it for all my fantasy and SF games since then.<br/><br/>I like the dice-rolling part, because it generates complications rather than answering trivial yes/no questions. It's trickier than one would expect, though, with a bit too much "wait, how can I work this mechanical outcome into the fiction?" going on, which also means resolving scene outcomes can take much longer than expected.<br/><br/>In general, my games lasted significantly longer than the stated play time (but then, that's a problem I've had with almost all games, all my life). This means both times talked about going for the shortened, two-round variants, and we did so in medias res. Regardless of what <i>we</i> chose (I think once we played the short game and once the regular, 3-round game, but it's been a while) I advise against this variant, especially on your first game - and that's because of the scene resolution system, again. When you roll dice for outcomes, it cares whether it's your last scene or not, because on the last round of scenes most of the mechanical outcomes don't make sense anymore (they're all about advantages and disadvantages carrying over to your next scene/s) and get flattened down to white or black beanies for the ending sequence. If you play a 2-round game as your first game, on the first round you're still learning the mechanics and on the second round you're playing with pared-down mechanics - so you never get to experience the sweet spot of competently playing with the full range of possible outcomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461392/#Comment_461392" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-25T12:55:35+00:00" title="March 25, 2017 12:55PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Noirlandia with Hannah and Evan running it at Dreamation back in February. Fun game! Very much a No Myth murder mystery game, a classic story-game setup where you're all working together to craft a self-consistent narrative. The dice rules seemed appropriate and well-designed, as well as *quite* harsh. We ended up succeeding in the mystery, but it would have been quite possible not to, and for our characters to end up spinning out into an uncontrollable cycle of self-destruction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461472/#Comment_461472" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-03-26T20:30:00+00:00" title="March 26, 2017  8:30PM">March 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game of Questlandia shortly after receiving the kickstarter release. I love the rule set and I think Hannah did a great job of putting it together.  At the table, play took a whole lot longer than expected: 4 hours in we had to break in the middle.  I think most of my players were overwhelmed by the creative freedom and relative complexity of world and character design, which ate up most of our time.  Unfortunately I was not able to get buy-in for the second half, so our story remains forever incomplete.  Note: This particular group ran different games every 2 weeks, and I think the slow start led to this game being less appealing to my players than other games which ramp up faster.<br/><br/>My advice would be to prep your players by having a discussion about worldbuilding and characters *before* you sit down to play; perhaps via email or in an online setting, so you can get into the meat of it when you sit down to play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
