While you know that I embrace discussion of all matters, perhaps we could forgo derailing the Glorantha discussion here by counter-analyzing my take; a new thread could be started on the topic of whether roleplaying is "high culture" if it's really interesting. Here in this thread I offer the following merely as a personal experience, so as to answer the given question about why Glorantha excites me. If the following annoys you, chances are that you're not really annoyed about my take on the topic, but about the background thinking that informs that take. Thus, a new thread would be warranted.<br/><br/>Roleplaying as a cultural endeavour is young, and its particular historical roots have relegated it into a subcultural niche that encourages populism, anti-intellectualism and a general view that roleplaying is trash culture. This markedly American phenomenon (for nowhere else was the transition from high dominant to popular culture so harsh and quick) is shared with practically all American modern artforms starting with pulp literature, so nothing very special there, but it does mean that rpg culture is biased towards conservative and simple artistic efforts. You'll be quick to hear about it if you have pretensions at doing something different from the next guy, and most of the time rpg culture people are just happy to not reach very high. RPG culture has to take the low road when beauty and excellence is desired, which basically means that it has to look like pulp literature: provide insights and art, but do not comment upon the real world directly, and do not have any intertextual weight in your offering; even the illiterate parts of the audience need to feel like you're not talking over their heads.<br/><br/>Now, this overall way things are in rpg culture has brought us into a situation where every roleplayer everywhere (or lets say every highly cultured roleplayer) generally has to lowball their expectations of cultural sophistication when they set aside their mainstream culture endeavours and get into roleplaying. By day you might be reading world literature, by night you're going to play whatever roleplaying games you play. Chances are that the game you're playing is intended for ages 12 and up, too. The transition between these cultural modes is so automatic to us that we might not even notice it. That is, until we accidentally stumble upon something actually sophisticated in a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>I've read quite a few roleplaying game texts, and played many as well, and most of them have many excellent things about them. However, the ones that reach the benchmark of <i>being relevant</i> to the greater world of literature and the arts are few and far between. This isn't because rpgs tend to be bad, it's simply because only rarely a roleplayer presumes to attempt something that is not simply safely derivative, but actually has original thought to it. Thus we live at a time when roleplayers very rarely produce art that has further meaning outside the rpg culture; there are very few roleplaying-related works that would be included on anybody's canons of literature, and this is simply because most games just don't do anything particularly interesting from the viewpoint of literature.<br/><br/>(I cannot emphasize how very at peace I am with this situation, by the way; roleplaying is not literature, so not being relevant literature is not a great flaw for a roleplaying game.)<br/><br/>At this point it's pretty obvious what my argument about Glorantha is going to be: in addition to being one of the great fantasy worlds of rpg history, Glorantha taken as a whole is also a remarkable literary work. It's one of the greatest works of modern fantasy literature, and made all the more so by being fortunately old enough to have escaped the ongoing post-Tolkien slump of the genre. <i>King of Sartar</i> (it's an older Stafford novel/epic about Glorantha), properly footnoted, can be taken quite seriously as a literary work of fantasy. Glorantha has produced many compelling works that depict the setting in living colors and with powerful themes in a way unsurpassed in the genre of world-building literature. Works like <i>King of Dragon Pass</i>,  <i>Thunder Rebels</i> and so on (admittedly rpg setting sourcebooks are full of repeat material, so being choosy about which exact books you read is good sense) simply depict a world that is head and shoulders above the common crop in literary seriousness.<br/><br/>This argument, obviously, relies on my own expertise on the subject. If I'm actually ignorant of what good fantasy literature is like, or you don't like good fantasy literature, then there's no particular guarantee that what Glorantha has to offer would be relevant to you :-D<br/><br/>I guess I should also explain what, exactly, the literary ambitions of Glorantha are. The work is sprawling, so pinpointing just a few themes is somewhat futile, but for me personally the way the Orlanthi culture is depicted is just beautiful; similar balls-to-the-wall romantization of mythic barbaric lifestyle has never been accomplished in literature before or since, perhaps with the potential exception of <i>Elfquest</i> (not coincidentally from the same society and era, by the way). Also, the intricate theological system of the setting is deeply realized and utilized unflinchingly in how the mythology and culture of the world unfolds. In general the setting rarely takes the childish or the humdrum or the lowbrow titillating track in anything that it establishes, so experiencing it is a delightful dialogue with a passionate observer of humanity and religion.<br/><br/>In summation: I don't think that Glorantha is an awesome rpg setting per se (it is not particularly interactive or easy to use or something like that), but I do think that it's great literature. Using it as a rpg setting makes sense because it's great literature, and it just might be the only such work that is explicitly created with a big, honking dramatic lacuna: as a rpg setting Glorantha does not have a central plot, which makes it entirely different from some other formative fantasy classics of the 20th century. In this it's a natural choice to use roleplaying as the media to enjoy the setting, much more so than with e.g. Middle-Earth; the latter is certainly a world-building endeavour of a similar scope, but its most powerful presentation is in the form of a novel, so roleplaying there is in a sense settling on the second-best option. Not so with Glorantha.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398079/#Comment_398079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T10:10:34+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 10:10AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It got ducks as playable characters!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398081/#Comment_398081" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T10:21:09+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 10:21AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 19, 2012 11:37AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My takeaway from Glorantha (as someone who came to it via Hero Wars in '99) is a "western fantasy" setting that is more indebted to anthropology and mythology than the usual version of such that's filtered through Tolkien.  Glorantha contains everything you'd need for your reliable late-'70s fantasy adventure experience, but that stuff all exists in a cultural context (sometimes several different cultures), and the books also contain examinations and deconstructions of the setting material from different perpectives, in an internally consistent way (as opposed to the usual "Clan X thinks they know all the secrets, but we of Clan Y have been feeding them lies but are in turn discredited by Clan Z's splatbook" method of creating ambiguity), and in a way that rings true to lovers of mythology-- neighboring cultures agree on the broad strokes of history, but disagree on the details, or interpretations of such (there are plenty of examples of one culture's chief god being regarded as the Satan figure of another, and vice versa).  And the part that moves this from interesting to maybe groundbreaking is that the game's cosmology and "high-level" play directly reflects this in the concept of heroquesting, where heroes go into the otherworld to prove or disprove the spiritual veracity of their cults' beliefs.  And this feeds back into the setting, because the recorded history and relationships between cultures has been directly impacted by the fact of this form of applied metaphysics.<br/><br/>TLDR, the setting is more anthropologically rich than any other fantasy setting that came before it, but isn't so abstruse that you can't go round up your buddies and go waste some <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">orcs</span>broo.  It just has all that extra depth already built in if you want to go looking for it, and the default character is more integrated into the setting than the classic wandering murderhobo.  Plus the setting draws influences from further afield than your usual pseudomedievalism-- the closest thing to a "default campaign setting" in Glorantha is Cattle Raiding Viking Celts vs Cultural Assimilationist Aztec Romans.<br/><br/>Of all the Glorantha stuff I've read (which isn't exhaustive, but I have been moved to go back to the Runequest roots), I definitely think the Hero Wars main book and accompanying Guide to Glorantha are the most easily digestible intro to the setting and why it's cool.  The RQ stuff I've seen is cool but lacks a wide-ranging overview, and the HeroQuest books are somehow less gripping than the HW version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398144/#Comment_398144" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T21:25:28+00:00" title="November 19, 2012  9:25PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, fellows.

I've only played on my iPhone, which I enjoyed, but the interface seemed a little cramped and sometimes important things were buried several menus deep.  It was a pretty cool experience I often only felt barely in control of, but would recommend nonetheless.<br/><br/>As far as an intro to Glorantha... it's a good example of several of the cool things the setting brings to the table (it is VERY good about showing its emphasis on myth, legend, magic, and community; the game starts with a questionnaire about your tribe's personal mythology and deeds of legend), but I'm not entirely sure how good an intro to the setting it is per se.  I enjoyed seeing setting elements I recognized pop up, but I think it stands alone decently well if you're willing to just work some things out from context or take the occasional oddball thing at face value.  And I'd forgotten there is a pretty good in-game codex with a bunch of cultural background and stories about the local pantheons, so the basics are well covered if you want to do some reading, even if, say, you might not know who the Grazers are beyond "those guys who keep raiding and kicking the shit out of me".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398173/#Comment_398173" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T04:34:38+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  4:34AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            King of Dragon Pass is the best available introduction to the setting.

It is the rich mythology that draws many people to Glorantha, the various cultures stories of their gods and heroes and thier struggle to save the world from destruction. Heroquesting, the ability of the PCs to re-enact those myths to magical effect remains a key differentiator of the setting. Many of the primary conflicts have their origin in the religious clashes between different cultures.<br/> <br/>Where many fantasy worlds are pseudo-medieval Glorantha is a late bronze-age/early iron age setting.  Glorantha has far more to do with Halstatt, La Tene, Scythia, Babylon, Sumer, Persia, the Hittites, the Sea Peoples, Phonecia, Mycene, the Minoans than western medieval Europe. It's stories are The Iliad and the Odyssey, Beowulf, Volsung Saga, and The Tain not the Mort D'Artur. The one outlier here was the West, which had morphed over the years into something like Arthurian myth; this book strips its back to Greg's old stories and makes it much more consistent with the rest of the setting. (IMO resembling Iron Age Indo-Greek culture such as in Bactria more than anything else). Now those sources can sound a little inaccessible, but the beauty of the new book is that they are beneath the surface and emerge in the culture and art descriptions: <a href="http://moondesignpublications.com/page/look-glorantha" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://moondesignpublications.com/page/look-glorantha</a><br/><br/>Glorantha is usually described as sword &amp; sorcery instead of heroic fantasy, and it's stories those of Conan and Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser than Frodo and Sam that are appropriate here.<br/><br/>"For those who came in late, Glorantha is a myth-heavy Bronze Age with a strong Howardian feel, but much more than that.
