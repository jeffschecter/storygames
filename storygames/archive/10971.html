When I see negative immersion discussions, they're usually here in Finland - we have such hardline immersionists here that people disagree with them now and then.<br/><br/>As for what's wrong with it (and I know that I'm now one of those aforementioned bad people here), I guess it's mainly that I'm not interested in it. I do accept that what I find interesting in roleplaying games <i>might</i> originate in immersion, but when I'm offered that thing directly, it's all I can do to not fall asleep at the thought. For some reason I just get bored at the idea of immersing myself into a character for some fragile and fleeting kicks of psychological nature; that's just too ephemeral as a method of play for me, and I doubt that I'd be that interested in roleplaying games if my enjoyment depended on getting into the right frame of mind or some shit like that.<br/><br/>Again, it is conceivably possible that the value I derive from roleplaying is in fact immersive in nature; however, this does not mean that I can or want to use the concept of immersion as a direct tool in playing the game. Thus I might say that while there's nothing wrong with immersion, as far as I'm concerned discussing it as anything but a post facto play report seems futile. Whenever people start shooting directly at immersion as a design goal or a matter of play technique, all the interesting bits of roleplaying games seem to fly straight out of the nearest window, to be replaced by some sort of psychodrama that lacks the game-like framework that interests me in roleplaying.<br/><br/>Considering the above personal experience, I pretty much have to toe the good ol' Forgista party line on this matter: immersion is best understood as a word that tries to capture the experience of vigorous and functional play. It is a fine thing to celebrate (even if I do that under different names), but a foolish thing to strive for directly. That's like if we removed the ball and goals from football and told the players to imagine really hard how fun the game is. Conseivably some people could derive enjoyment from direct self-suggestion like that, but most of us wouldn't consider that a very good game of football.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Hmm... the above will benefit from a bit wider viewpoint, I think. Consider the things that rules and game-like elements give to roleplaying: by having goals and reward cycles and all those things you the player can focus your activity in the game better than normally in the world, thanks to the simplified and priorized sandbox the game environment offers. Meanwhile the game-like qualities of the game provide interactivity, allowing you to engage the system and produce content without actually having to do the work normally associated with content-production. In other words, you get to create all sorts of fun and surprising things without having to get bored and tired by the work of invention.<br/><br/>Now, when I think of immersion, I first and foremost think of games and play styles that have been labeled as particularly immersive. I usually find these boring and tiresome exactly because they don't fare too well by the above metric: apparently hardline immersionists consider games without game-like structures to be the most immersive, which means that they've pretty much replaced all the stuff I find interesting in roleplaying games with a focused psychodramatic exercise. I have nothing against that, except for the fact that I don't want to do it.<br/><br/>I guess I could say that there's nothing wrong with immersion, but the techniques used for producing it are boring as roleplaying games. I'm sure that I'd gauge the whole matter differently if you framed the immersion exercise in a non-gaming context. In fact, I often suggest to immersionist game designers that they might benefit from connecting with magicians, theatre people, larpers and other such subcultures that make wide use of immersionistic psychodrama. Not everybody is like this, but some designers I've met are so system-hostile that I genuinely don't understand why they're writing games (scenarios, really) instead of plays or other non-gaming entertainment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243357/#Comment_243357" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T03:48:27+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  3:48AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2009 3:48AM by Matthijs.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Read my article "Stop saying immersion!" <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.liveforum.dk/kp07book/lifelike_holter.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, if you haven't already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243366/#Comment_243366" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T04:54:59+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  4:54AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good article, Matthijs!

Immersion is defined in the dictionary as "absorbing involvement" which seems to fit every discussion of the term I've ever seen. The only issue is what interested you enough to absorb and involve you, which is obviously subjective.<br/><br/>There are things that can pretty much universally damage immersion, like someone bursting into the game room and asking unrelated questions on a regular basis, or any other distraction coming from outside the game.<br/><br/>Apparently I agree with the "Forge party line" on this one. The reason discussing "immersion" is usually unhelpful (or even meaningless) is that it just means "really enjoying and focusing on the game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243437/#Comment_243437" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T10:13:24+00:00" title="November 24, 2009 10:13AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hardcore "immersionists" seem, from where I'm sitting, to feel that "real immersion" (wow lots of scare quotes going on here) is both substantially different and definitionally superior to the dictionary-slash-common-sense definition. The sense I get is that their understanding of, and pursuit of, their kind of immersion has a ... I don't know, transcendent quality to it. And because it's transcendent, it is better. Therefore, if you're not gaming toward that transcendent experience, you're doing it wrong.<br/><br/>It bears a very strong resemblance to the hardcore narrativists' position. At least that's how it looks to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243450/#Comment_243450" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T11:07:13+00:00" title="November 24, 2009 11:07AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm just suggesting that both groups are being elitist jerks and are using their selective redefinition of the term to justify their behavior.<br/><br/>The problem (as I see it) is that "immersionist" is used to refer to "character immersionists" or occasionally "setting immersionists". Just because you think what you're doing is the best kind of immersion doesn't give you the right to co-opt the entire word, just like I can't tell you that your peanut butter and jam on bread is NOT a sandwich because my club sandwich is better.<br/><br/>I think maybe the reason people keep getting confused when someone tries to throw a definition around is because people (correctly) believe that immersion is a good thing in a play experience (obviously true, since immersion is pretty much just a specific kind of enjoyment) so they're trying to equate what they're doing with immersion.<br/><br/>You could do the same thing by calling immersion in a character "fun", but you'd be more obviously insane if you tried to argue that it was the ONLY kind of fun.<br/><br/>Maybe I should just give it a rest because my problem is a semantic one, but I really think that the "problem" with immersion becomes pretty clearly an issue of taste when the language is treated properly. That is to say (again) that the only problem with immersion is that people use it to play silly word games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243451/#Comment_243451" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T11:15:27+00:00" title="November 24, 2009 11:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Character-immersionists kinda bug me.

To me, player responsibility is a big issue. If you're going to immerse heavily when I GM, that's great. (I prefer it, personally, to players who love fiddling with the system, for example). However, of course I expect players to be more-or-less functional human adults. I expect them to give each other space and spotlight, to support each others' play, to be able to talk about the game if the group needs it. <br/><br/>I've personally struggled with the problem of how to handle four or five players, each doing their own thing. The solutions I've come up with have mostly been to make them engage with each others' stories even if their characters aren't there. By playing each others' subconscious desires; playing NPCs; creating destinies for each others; being oracles for each other; being positive and negative influences on each others' lives. This is also great for getting people invested in each others' stories. (Archipelago is pretty much built on this philosophy).<br/><br/>Edited to add: I guess what I'm saying is that in my group, immersionists don't get free blowjobs.

The group of immersionists that I was calling elitist were hardcore "immersionists" who seem, from where I'm sitting, to feel that "real immersion" is both substantially different and definitionally superior to the dictionary-slash-common-sense definition. That's NOT "all immersionists".

I am pleased as all hell to find out that the word "immersion" is essentially meaningless; not only does it appeal to my sense of the absurd, it means I don't have to try to fit what I enjoy in gaming into some particular one-word description.  (And since I can't do that, I actually have to think about what I like and what I don't like, and explain that to the people I'm gaming with, which is about a billion times more useful than just throwing out a one-word description.)<br/><br/><br/>For whatever it's worth (and to further muddy the waters, perhaps), when I'm playing I strongly prefer to engage with the game on the level of my character; I want to set agendas within the game through my character, I want to pursue those agendas through my character's skills and circumstances, I want to make decisions based on what my character knows and what he can do about it.  Mechanics that drag me away from that -- narration passing and other things typically assigned to a GM -- bug me, because they're getting in the way of my fun.  It is at that point that the dreaded I-word might come up, because I've gone from being "immersed" in my character to playing a more authorial role in the game, and that's in DO NOT WANT territory.<br/><br/>Still, when I <i>want</i> to have a more authorial role, I typically just go GM a game, and have a lot of fun doing it.  So it's not me just hating that style of play entirely.  I think it's more that I don't like <i>mixing</i> those styles together.  If I'm there to play a character, I want to play the character and not step outside of that; and if I'm there to direct the narrative on a higher level, I don't want to "immerse" in playing a character, I just want to drop in and out of various NPCs and keep all my agenda-setting and how-do-they-react-to-this thoughts on a more GM-ish plane.<br/><br/>(And I rarely if ever spend a whole game so wrapped up in my character that I can't see beyond it; our group is fond of breaking character to make jokes, and I love that.  So "immersion" for me was never about "being the character" or "feeling what the character feels," at least not on a long-term basis.  I'm happiest when I <i>do</i> connect strongly to what the character is going through, and I can empathize with his emotional state and his situation, but I don't lose myself in the experience, any more than I lose myself at a good movie or when reading a good novel.  I mean, I'm obviously a guy sitting at a table with friends enjoying a game, I can see the dice and everything.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243506/#Comment_243506" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T14:03:06+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  2:03PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never seen anyone talk about immersion without making some reference to losing their sense of self.

They just know their OD&amp;D, and they have played in the same world for 20+ years. They rarely play, but when they do, they are absolutely living their characters and imagining that they are in the world. We all are. It's exciting, we care what happens, and they simply aren't aware that their are other systems and are mainly not interested in how and why the game plays as it does. In this game, I am a black box GM. Of course it's an illusion, like a film or especially a play is an illusion. So, by immersion, in this specific game mean you can almost see and taste the shared world, you care about your characters and cooperate to have fun in a non-meta-game way. It's visceral It's pop-corn-munching roller coaster ride rather than a private viewing of abstract photography.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not claiming that any particular system brings you that experience, it's probably just historical circumstance, and a ridiculously long campaign stretching from those formative years when we had the time and drive to get so deeply involved.

I've never felt particularly overburdened when I ran a game -- I'm doing more than I did as a player, sure, but not <i>that much more</i>, because I actually do a <i>lot</i> when I play a character.  Really what I'm doing is "different stuff, and slightly more of it."  And being in the spotlight more, too, which is a different kind of pressure (not really a "duty"); I will say that while that can be exhilarating for a while, it's also really draining and one of the reasons why I only GM when I really, really want that experience.<br/><br/>I can see how it would be tricky, though, if you particularly felt (and disliked) either the differences or the increased duties.  I mean, the three traditional ways for a GM to reduce workload are to pass it along to the players, to find a more efficient way of doing some task (including NOT doing it at all), or to make it more fun so it doesn't feel like work at all.  And if you're looking at players who don't want to step outside playing their characters, the first one of those is just impossible: in my experience, what I do running a game is too different from what I do playing a character.<br/><br/>Still, I have had success on both sides when the sharing of "GM duties" was done <i>outside the game session</i>.  I enjoy a good out-of-character chat about the state of the game as much as the next guy (if not more), and I certainly don't mind contributing ideas or statting something up or doing other prep work to help out the GM when I'm the player.  I'll gladly participate in a brainstorming session and even talk out-of-character about my own PC or other characters (PC or NPC) and where I'd like to see them go.  Well, as long as we're not actually playing at the time, as I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>So while that's obviously not going to help if the tasks you want to offload are things you <i>must</i> do during a game, it might work out if the duties you want less of are things you can prepare in advance.  (An interesting note: we've tried assigning players to run particular NPCs in scenes, and while the players tend to enjoy it -- it's a nice palate cleanser for me, for example -- many times the GM has discovered that he <i>doesn't</i>, because he likes playing NPCs and consquently doesn't get to do it as often as he wants.  That's one case where we don't share out part of the GM's workload because it actually makes things less fun for the GM; it takes away a reward instead of taking away a duty.)<br/><br/>As for the second typical way to reduce workload, making things more efficient tops out eventually: once you pared down, perfected, or thrown out everything you possibly can without making the game stop working, you're done there.  If that's not enough to make GMing the game seem equitable to you, there's not much more you can do.<br/><br/>And the third, making it feel more fun, well, that seems beyond the powers of advice; you most likely just have to find a way to do it that works for you...I doubt anyone else can really tell you what's going to be fun for you, unless they know you exceptionally well.<br/><br/>(It's the "making it feel more fun" part where I think I get most of my value out of GMing and why I don't see it as being too much work.  I don't do it regularly, just when I really want to wallow in how fun it is to do all of those things, so I'm usually really excited to be in the GM's chair for a game and actually looking forward to the "extra duties" involved.  For example, I'm a freak who actually enjoys prep work, so I don't feel like I'm carrying an extra burden there -- I'm just getting to play a fun game by myself before we play the "real" game later on.  And honestly, I do prep work as a player, too, except I usually call it "daydreaming.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243577/#Comment_243577" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T22:53:32+00:00" title="November 24, 2009 10:53PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good practical stuff there, Taste.<br/><br/>Can you tell me anythingyou do as part of the OOG discussions?

We've tried things like bluebooking or e-mail questionnaires, but there's definitely a "chore" aspect to that stuff which rears its ugly head.  Basically, we're a group that says "gaming is a fun thing to do, but not the only fun thing to do," and a lot of us have jobs which can be really time-consuming...so if you ask everyone in the group to do something for the game during the week, you have to realize that it's taking away personal time and may not even be possible if things have heated up at work.<br/><br/>Making it an <i>interaction</i> rather than an assignment seems to grease the wheels a lot; you can send out an e-mail asking for brief responses to two questions and get incomplete and/or grudging replies, but if you catch somebody on instant messenger and ask those same two questions, you'll get good answers right away, plus they'll probably volunteer even more ideas.  We're not wired for homework, but we're definitely wired for socialization.  The closer you get to face-to-face conversation, the more we seem to connect to it.<br/><br/>So maybe that's an approach to formalizing out-of-game input: setting up easy ways to converse with each other during the week between sessions and having topics already in mind.  Maybe send an e-mail to the group saying "Hey, please think about this topic, I'd like to talk with you about it this week" to prime the pump, and then make the rounds (IM or e-mail or telephone or over lunch or whatever) to talk about it with them.  Sort of mini-"state of the game" meetings scheduled during flex-time.<br/><br/>edit to add: I should also note that as far as I know, basically all of the player-to-player OOG idea sharing is done via interaction during the week, and none of it by "assignment."  It's always someone e-mailing or IMing or talking to someone else and saying "I was thinking about this, any thoughts?  You want in on it?  What can we do to make this even cooler?" and then going around and showing off the cool new thing to everyone else.  There has to be a lesson buried in that, I think.\n<blockquote>Also, do you folks engage in any non-game but game related stuff, like drawing characters, makig minor props or doing very sort fiction and sharing it?</blockquote>\nDefinitely, but we moved away from giving any kind of reward for it when we realized that: A.) the people who enjoyed doing those things would do it without any reward (because the act of creating it and sharing it <i>is</i> the reward), and B.) the people who don't enjoy/don't have time for that either end up feeling pressured to do the same, or slighted because they can't do the same.<br/><br/>So these days, we get a fairly constant stream of character depictions and short stories and in-game artifacts (documents, news stories, etc.) over the course of the campaign, but we don't <i>expect</i> to get it.  If the spirit moves you, awesome; if it doesn't, no worries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
