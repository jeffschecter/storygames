One complaint from the latter group, however, was that the fight rules favored high Technique and the Bob&amp;weave tactical option (unless you took the risk and went Street Style). There didn't seem to be much room for a more power-centered fighter, since you'd never land a blow unless you won the Domination check.<br/><br/>I talked to the players and thought about it, and came up with the following tentative hack:<br/><br/><br/>1. After making the tactical choice, the fighters check Domination as in the original with (Domination Score + Technique). The winner of this check gains VPs according to the chart on page 32 without waiting for the Damage check.<br/><br/>2. Regardless of the outcome of the Domination check, the fighters each check Damage with (Damage Score + Power) vs. (Cover). However, the dominant fighter can add their measure of Dominance (the difference by which they won the Domination check) to either their Damage or Cover. The winner of the Damage check gains DPs (Damage Points) according to the chart on page 32.<br/><br/>3. If a boxer's dirty trick is discovered, the opponent may gain VP according to the rule on pages 33-4, but not DP.<br/><br/>4. DP can be spent to give an opponent Trait penalties. VP cannot. If all of a contender's boxing scores fall to zero, he collapses from fatigue or injury, or the ref stops the fight. If both sides are standing at he end of the match, the one with the higher VP wins.<br/><br/><br/>So that's my hack to lessen the clear, er, dominance of Technique and Bob&amp;weave and to make high Power scorers more viable. I'd like to playtest this a few times, but my group is playing either Beast Hunters or Polaris next week so I don't know when I'll get a chance. In the meantime, feedback is much appreciated, including on whether such a hack is necessary in the first place.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132411/#Comment_132411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T14:42:04+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  2:42PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            now that you mention it, Bob&amp;Weave does get used rather much<br/><br/>but wouldn't it be simpler to just recalibrate it to Domination=4 / Damage=1?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132431/#Comment_132431" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-04T16:04:34+00:00" title="March  4, 2008  4:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2008 4:05PM by Eldir.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>now that you mention it, Bob&amp;Weave does get used rather much<br/><br/>but wouldn't it be simpler to just recalibrate it to Domination=4 / Damage=1?</blockquote>\nWould it really solve the problem (if indeed it is a problem) of technique being way more important than power, though? One would still need to dominate the round in order to land a punch, and the high technique/bob&amp;weave combination would still be dominant to the exclusion of more choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132522/#Comment_132522" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T03:06:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  3:06AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            just for the sake of argument <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>is Technique really so much more important than the other stats?<br/><br/>it's true you do have to dominate the round in order to be able to do something useful<br/><br/>but if you spend all your points on Technique, you won't actually hurt the other guy once you hit him<br/><br/>and if you've got plenty of Technique but no Cover, you'll bite the dust at the first unlucky draw<br/><br/>no Conditionning? the other guy will just Bob&amp;Weave until you're down to nothing, then knock you out<br/><br/>so maxing out on Technique doesn't seem like such a good idea to me                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132525/#Comment_132525" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T03:29:54+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  3:29AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure of the need for a fix really, as I've never seen a problem with the way the game currently works. Actually, in a recent game, I had a guy with a pretty high technique and sure, I was cruising for the first couple of rounds. Then in the third, I lost the domination check and his weak cover meant it was a KO and a quick trip to concussion land for him. Match well and truly over. <br/><br/>I've also never really seen a dominance of one style over another. I mean, yes, you can play it tactically and once you are up by some VPs, you can try to go defensive and keep your lead that way, but it's a risky strategy. I always seem to see a fair combination of all styles, including street style (dirty, no good sons of bitches!)<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132626/#Comment_132626" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T09:43:18+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  9:43AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2008 9:43AM by Eldir.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True, no one upped their Technique while completely ignoring all the other traits, but high Technique and bob&amp;weave still remain the most viable strategy and technique the best way to spend training dollars. I only lost one match in two games (I'd had a connection threatened that once) and my own strategy was high Technique, mostly Bob&amp;weave, occasionally Street Style if I was feeling lucky, then burning Hope once Conditioning falls to zero. I actually used Puncher's Choice repeatedly to lose a match on purpose. <br/><br/>Not that there's anything wrong with having a working strategy, of course, but I'd like there to be other viable strategies as well. The test is in the playtest--I'll write an AP once I've given this a whirl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
