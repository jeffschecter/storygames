One of the last pages is a coupon with a registration code and a URL.  You go to the site, fill out a middlingly-specific form asking you about your AP and addressing specific playtesting questions, and you get Y dollars off of the finished product game when it comes out.<br/><br/>To my mind, this has the following advantages:<br/>a) You have a much greater chance of getting useful, actionable, specific feedback.<br/>b) You increase your sales of the finished product.<br/>c) You can track (via registration code) how many ashcans produced feedback.<br/>d) You collate the feedback you do get into one place.<br/>e) You can easily produce a list of playtesters for the credits page.<br/>f) You can easily turn this into a registrations-at-website drive and get participants in forums and the like.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/>What should $X and $Y be, and what relationship should they have?  $10 cost, $5 coupon seems "about right" to me, but what are the parameters?<br/>How much server-side tech would this really require?

My 'saddle-stitched' comment was just to highlight the difference in production values between the ashcan and the finished product.  Even in electronic form, I'm assuming the finished product has better and more polished design, copy, art, layout, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65019/#Comment_65019" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T11:45:16+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 11:45AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What should $X and $Y be, and what relationship should they have? $10 cost, $5 coupon seems "about right" to me, but what are the parameters?<br/></blockquote>\nCall me a greedy consumer (because I am) but I think that the only way the whole process would seem attractive is to actually offer a coupon equal to the full price of the ashcan. So, $X and $Y are equal ($10 cost, $10 coupon). This is especially true given the requirement for playtesting prior to recieving the coupon.<br/><br/>Now, I have not been involved in the nitty-gritty of publishing (especially in this format) so I am not sure whether it is cost-prohibitive, but I think that the math probably works out (sure, you lose money on the final product because of the discount, but that is the price that you pay for a larger amount of initial-up front capital) plus you get the benifit of playtesting and a stronger initial fanbase.\n<blockquote><br/>How much server-side tech would this really require? At the low-tech end, could this be "start a forum thread and answer these three questions"?<br/></blockquote>\nCertainly not my area of expertise but, depending on your website host, it is generally pretty easy to set up a survey connected to a database (in terms of information analysis, this is far superior to the forum method). On the other hand, building it into the forum might work to develop a stronger sense of initial community and foster discussion *shrug*\n<blockquote><br/>Would you do this? Would you feel a part of the process if the ashcan was "interactive" like this? If so, what part tickles your fancy? If not, why not?</blockquote>\nAs a designer I appreciate the 'required feedback' angle and I think that it would foster a better response. As a consumer, I would feel like I am paying for what is essentially a 'playtesting' copy (I realize that this is NOT what the ashcan format is but on first glance that is how I percieved it), and this is a pretty big hurdle to overcome. Having a physical book, no matter how incomplete the actual rules are, alleviates some of this concern. On the other hand... the publishing costs make PDF ashcans more attractive *shrug*. <br/><br/>I think that it is worth a try, if nothing else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65026/#Comment_65026" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T12:08:05+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 12:08PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm still iffy about the ashcan process, both as consumer and as publisher.

That said, and with the base assumption that the game in all three situations in interesting and grabby, I think I'd be most likely to provide feedback, and provide elaborate feedback, under option (a).<br/><br/>To me, the explicit understanding that buying the ashcan is buying into a larger process, that I will get a discount off the finished product, and that I will have the finished product in my hands at some point, really drives it home for me.  The coupon makes me a stakeholder in the finished game, whereas simply buying the ashcan -- no matter what the cost is -- means I bought the <em>opportunity</em> to participate in the process.  Buying the ashcan under (b) and (c) can be a fire-and-forget sort of deal, where I will not feel like I lost anything if I go home and don't actually playtest; buying the ashcan with the coupon, on the other hand, would make me feel like I'm part of the process, on the team, and I have some assured interaction with the creator/publisher in the future.<br/><br/>As to the second question, (a) increases the chances that at the end of the process I'll have a finished product in my hand, whereas (b) and (c) have far less encouragement to do so.  It's a lot easier feeling satisfied with my participation in a creative effort when I have what came out of it in my hand.  Which is sort of a dodgy answer, but the bulk of any satisfaction would be the quality and reception of the game when it was published -- which of these three options the ashcan worked under would be, I think, rather minor comparatively.<br/><br/>Now I turn the tables!

So I'm very much less likely to buy a) than either b) or c). Particularly if a) came with a deadline. I'd know going into it that ashcan a) would gnaw and nag at me. I'd be worried about not earning out the $15. (I remain frustrated at myself to this day for forgetting to send in for a $50 rebate on my ViewSonic monitor, and that was five years ago.) And y'know, I have enough anxiety in my life; I don't need it in my hobby.<br/><br/>If I did buy a), probably I'd try to bang out the feedback requirement as quickly as possible (likely doing the minimum), thus dissolving the anxiety. And then I'd vaguely hope to follow up with actual playtesting and more substantial feedback. But having dealt with the programming probably I wouldn't actually make time for it. And if the $15 was less than the price of the published game, there's also a good chance I wouldn't cash in on it, out of guilt at having given just the minimum feedback to satisfy the deal. Blech.<br/><br/>I think I'm most likely to put meaningful effort into helping the designer behind ashcan c). The lack of payout incentives on the deal treats me like an adult, not like a programmable drone, and so I'm going to feel good about reading the ashcan and writing up my thoughts, like the designer considers me a respected collaborator. The $10 price will keep me from buying more ashcans than I can commit to, and also lets me really expect the designer to listen and communicate about my feedback. By charging me $10 the designer is giving me far greater license to hold his designing and publishing to a high standard than the designer who charges me $3; and as a playtester and giver of feedback I always feel better interacting with designers who're that fucking serious.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65315/#Comment_65315" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T11:34:56+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 11:34AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Call me crazy, but I don't see why you can't combine A and C and eliminate the 'obligation' element entirely.<br/><br/>So, either way you are paying "$10" for an ashcan which you, hopefully, understand is an incomplete game and in need of playtesting.

But that's just me.<br/><br/>Paul, I find your response interesting.  You'd feel more comfortable with the $10 ashcan that doesn't have any incentive for participation than buying the $10 ashcan that does have an incentive for participation?  Same cost to you if you don't playtest and furnish feedback, but you'd still feel obligated if it had that coupon in the back.  What if the coupon wasn't part of the pitch, but something you discovered at the back of the book when you got home?<br/><br/>I'm curious: to what extent do you feel the purchase of any ashcan implies an obligation, or at least the signalling of interest, to provide playtest feedback?<br/><br/>To me, the whole point of an ashcan is soliciting feedback, and it seems to me you would not want to be selling them to folks who just want to look over the game.  As Matt says, the idea is to get the ratio of feedback to sales to be as close to 1 as possible.  If the assumption is that they are going into hands that will playtest them, what's the harm in giving them material thanks when they do?  How is giving them nothing but a byline more "adult" than recompensing them for their time and effort?<br/><br/>In talking through this, I'm getting close to concluding, for me, that X should equal Y.  Ashcan for $10, coupon for $10 off.  That way, participation in the playtest reimburses you for the ashcan.  Playtesters get a copy for free, curious folks who want to look over your ashcan pay you for the privilege.<br/><br/>Curious: What happens if we make the numbers smaller: $5 ash can, $5 coupon?  Can the incentive be low enough that it doesn't feel like an obligation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65324/#Comment_65324" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T12:13:01+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 12:13PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's a certain amount of self-selection involved here.

My understanding of it is that these are "complete" games in the sense that the writing is finished, they have been printed, and (I hope) have been playtested at least a little.

An ashcan is an opportunity for creative problem solving, and helping a game realize its full potential. Working with a committed designer on a game in active development is creatively exciting, and always you test and advance your own design skills, regardless of whether you're a better or worse designer than the game's designer. It's not for everyone, but it's clear that for lots of folks this is a powerfully engaging part of the hobby.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67386/#Comment_67386" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T13:34:34+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  1:34PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't dispute that getting involved with game designing of someone else's project is cool. But I think that ashcans aimed at fellow designers are different from ashcans aimed at prospective players.<br/><br/>I mean, I look at trying to sell my own <b>Bone White, Blood Red</b> from Game Chef. I suspect that some of the people who participated in Game Chef this year would be among the first to buy the game, when I get it done. But I also realize that these people are not very representative of the gaming marking, and in fact, a lot of their feedback from the standpoint of "a fellow game designer" isn't helpful for figuring out what "a potential customer would want."<br/><br/>If buying an ashcan edition is the buy-in for "getting in on the ground level" with a hot new game, then sure, probably some game designers would do it. If it's the requirement for helping people to fix their games and become a better designer, I can see game designers doing that too, if they have extra cash.<br/><br/>Jason's comment way up at the start of this thread, the second post, touches on this designer/consumer divide.<br/><br/>If you can convince other game designers to help you with your game, that's great. If you can convince them to help you while <em>paying you money</em> for the privilege, more power to you! I just find it a little hard to view this as a sustainable revenue model with a legitimate market out there, which is, I believe, what Joshua was asking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Sorry if it seems like I'm stepping on the toes of your pet project.

Ashcans are not at all about how priceless the "right game" is in "your" hands.<br/><br/>Ashcans are a way to benefit the game developer, and the only reason that you would want to buy one is because your $10 would allow you to tell the game developer what to fix in his game.<br/><br/>This definition is very different from the definition of "ashcans" that I'm used to, but it apparently is the only thing we're supposed to be using the word for nowaways.<br/><br/>Again: What matters is not "the right game," it's "the right hands." It's about getting your unfinished game into "the right hands," i.e. people who are willing to pay money to develop your game for you.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter how you sell it, necessarily, since this isn't selling games.

And partly because I think the answer is different for each game. Scott Knipe's <i>WYRD</i> ashcan back in 2001 did it with cover artwork and layout:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/wyrd-cover.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.halfmeme.com/images/wyrd-open.jpg"/></div><br/><br/>And that's the traditional solution. But the opportunity of an ashcan format is the ability to experiment. My own plan is for the <i>Acts of Evil</i> ashcan to look like a garage edition of the <i>Satanic Bible</i>:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e8/Satanicbible.gif"/></div><br/><br/>So, stark black cover and centered text, except tape bound, and with my own choice of occult iconography done with splatter paint and paint stamping. <br/><br/>I haven't seen Eric's <i>Infected</i> ashcan, but were it to be at Gen Con, as you suggest, it's worth considering how the presentation of the book might capture people's interest by hinting about the nature of the game. I'm thinking maybe packaging them in crisp, sterile looking, clear mylar bags, each prominently affixed with a "bloodborne pathogens" or "infectious waste" biohazard sticker.<br/><br/>Actually, I'd quite enjoy a conversation about how designers think they might ashcan their games for capturing the attention of convention attendees. Even if you've published the game already, how might you have crafted the ashcan? On a new thread maybe?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67615/#Comment_67615" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T13:12:13+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  1:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New thread!
