It was in flux, but here's more or less what our group was rolling with.<br/><br/>Differences from Ghost/Echo:<br/><br/>1)  "Roll Dice When... 'you channel the Ghost Field' or 'you listen to for Echoes'" are simply replaced with whatever mystical arcana thing the players come up with; the Dangers associated with the new things remain similar.  They are basically just flavors of "You Suffer Harm" and "You Get Put In A Bad Position."<br/><br/>2)  There is no such thing as "when you\u2019re especially well-prepared for the action at hand , roll an extra die."  It's replaced with Aspects and Ephemera which can give you an extra die.  This simply differentiates the characters mechanically and codifies the kind of things they are uniquely "well-prepared" for.<br/><br/>3) Each PC has three "Aspects" to begin with and they each have a dedicated Fate point a la Fate 2.0.  When it makes sense narratively, you can expend the dedicated Fate point to get an extra die towards achieving a Goal.  Aspects could be expressed as a relationship, a cool item, a mastery, some other skill, a personal quality, great connections, a sweet hideout, etc.  <br/><br/>4) Each PC starts with one effective quantity of Ephemera.  When it makes sense narratively, you can expend it to get an extra die towards achieving a Goal.<br/><br/>5) Ephemera do not "Refresh."  PCs may occasionally find more in-game by successful endeavors.  Some Ephemera may take the form of an object you always have, but they are not "effective" unless you can successfully power it up.  Example: you have "Map of Meridian" but the map doesn't help you unless you have powered it up with research, interpretive help, rune mastery or some such.  You might also express an object as an Aspect instead of Ephemera, indicating something you always have.  But even that will not always be potent (see below).<br/><br/>6) Aspects "Refresh" when you achieve a Hope.  Refresh is equal to Aspects/2 rounded down. So, "1" for a starting character, "2" for a character with four or five Aspects.  <br/><br/>7) Each PC has two Hopes at any given time.  One is chosen by themselves and one is given by another player.  Hopes are medium-range goals that might reasonably be achieved about every other session of play.  Once you achieve them, you get a new one either chosen by yourself or given by another player depending on which kind you achieved.<br/><br/>8) Advancement!  Every other time you achieve a Hope, you get an additional Aspect, up to five total.  After that you can change Aspects but not add them.  <br/><br/>Other:<br/><br/>1) Not so much a hack as an interpretation we arrived at when playing Ghost/Echo for the first time:  first you might suffer "Harm" and then when Harmed you might risk becoming Incapacitated if you were doing something else that might reasonably Harm you.  You might be able to get rid of Harm or other conditions when you're in a reasonably safe place and have either time, aid by another, or some kind of Ephemera to "heal" your Harm.  It's basically like every PC has 2 hit points and every weapon and spell in the world has potential to do one hit point of damage and if you go to zero you're knocked out.  If you're knocked out alone in a bad place it's up to GM fiat what happens next.<br/><br/>2) Here's another interpretation of some reasonable Dangers you might decide on, given the above hacks:<br/><br/>a) "There's a Danger I lose some Ephemera."<br/>b) "There's a Danger I lose an Aspect"<br/>c) "There's a Danger that I am killed." This is how you raise the "death flag." The GM won't otherwise kill a PC.  They may do things that feel considerably worse than death if a PC is Incapacitated and falls into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>That's about it, I think.  We had a lot of fun with the world we'd created and wanted to hang some additional rules on it for ongoing play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334257/#Comment_334257" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T12:37:50+00:00" title="July 13, 2011 12:37PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good summary, there.
