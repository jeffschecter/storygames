If you want to argue whether or not Egri was correct in any of his particular assertions, hey, that's great, but please spawn off another thread for that sort of thing.<br/><br/>The introduction is available at:<br/><a href="http://roger.carbol.com/rpg/egri/egri.html" rel="nofollow">http://roger.carbol.com/rpg/egri/egri.html</a><br/><br/>Here's a few brief snippets to whet the appetite:<br/><br/>* Every living creature is capable of doing anything, if the conditions around him are strong enough.<br/><br/>* A pivotal character must not merely desire something. He must want it so badly that he will destroy or be destroyed in the effort to attain his goal.<br/><br/>* You cannot expect a rising conflict from a man who wants nothing or does not know what he wants.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks to everyone for their time,<br/>Roger                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83601/#Comment_83601" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T06:14:41+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  6:14AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Roger,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat seems like a fine summary.

And of those people, how many consider themselves experts? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm saying is that I hope you get some good feedback on your question... but you do realize that you may now be the "expert" on this subject here?<br/>\n<br/>\n:-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83839/#Comment_83839" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T19:38:39+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  7:38PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger,<br/><br/>I recommend using the full title of the book:<br/><br/>"The Art Of Dramatic Writing: <i>Its Basis in the Creative Interpretation of Human Motives</i>".<br/><br/><br/>And perhaps you should be more-specific in describing the influence of the book on Ron Edwards,<br/>namely by noting that Egri's term "premise" is the source and equivalent of Edwards' term "theme".<br/><br/>The quotes you've chosen represent the book's ideas accurately, but-- isolated as a series of jargon and epigrams/<br/>the quotes read as if they are excerpts from a some dense, academic tome (written in 1715 by Gottfried Leibniz and<br/>dryly translated from the original German. By Ron.)  ((ok, not thaat bad. But still...))<br/><br/>In actuality, The Art of Dramatic Writing is a "for Dummies" -type book; written in a conversational tone for layman readers.<br/><br/>My point is that you've distilled the book to its potent essence.  But you haven't de-mystified it. <br/>So perhaps you've succeeded at something other than the thing you set out to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83887/#Comment_83887" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-29T14:19:57+00:00" title="July 29, 2007  2:19PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am also by no means an Egri expert, but I have read the book.<br/><br/>The main bit that clashes with my recollection, is the part where you lay out premise, pivotal character, conflict, etc. as though it were a recipe to be followed.<br/><br/>Memory is an unreliable beast, and I have misplaced my copy of the book.

It's out of print, but I recommend it highly to anyone interested in Dramatic writing.<br/><br/>I have no idea if either strategy works best. I do know different people succeed using different methods.<br/><br/>Egri has a point -- you're usually going to find a change in behavior across a bit of dramatic writing.  Kerr's point was: follow the human engaging moments first, and then go back and fix up all that stuff.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83987/#Comment_83987" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:19:28+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:19AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a correction, and comment related to what Curly wrote. <br/>\n<br/>\nCurly said that Egri's "premise" leads to Ron's "theme." Which isn't quite accurate. In Ron's theory about Narrativism, he says that you develop a premise as well, but that, since RPGs are about the evolotion of the plot, the premise is not a statement to be proven, but a question to be asked. "Theme," then, is what is created when a participant in a RPG answers such a question. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one definition of the difference between sim and nar, in sim, the GM creates the themes by answering the questions, and in nar, he asks, but the players create the themes by their answers. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Note that this is always a problematic answer, because it seems to define sim by making it a negation of nar, which is not the intent of the description of the dividing line here. IOW, I don't want to argue the point.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84043/#Comment_84043" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T09:17:18+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  9:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for everyone's feedback so far.  This is in chronological order:<br/><br/><b>Mike:</b>  Excellent point... fortunately, this thread seems to have picked up a bit.  Still, in the long run, it may be a lot more useful to more people to discuss specific bits of advice from Egri and to what degree they are applicable to story games.<br/><br/><b>Curly:</b>  The title -- yeah, I was tempted to use the full title... it seemed to make the book just that much more daunting, though, so I decided against it.  Still, I'll give it some more thought.<br/><br/>As for being more explicit about the relationship between Premise and Theme... in general, I wrestled quite a bit with just how much of my own commentary and analysis to put into this.  In the end, I decided on pretty much none.  It might make sense to cram some of that into a companion piece that covers these topics, though.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure what Ithink about the 'de-mystification' issue yet.  I hadn't thought about it in that light before.  I'll have to give it some more thought.<br/><br/><b>Dave:</b>  Hmmm.  I agree that the way I laid it out certainly implies it's a recipe to be followed.  Whether or not that was ever Egri's intention... I'm not sure.  I started with what I called 'A Brief Outline', which is almost verbatim from Egri's book's Section 4, Chapter 11 -- "When You Write a Play".  I think it's plausible, at least, to suppose that Egri meant his book to be not only descriptive, but prescriptive.<br/><br/><b>lumpley:</b> Agreed.<br/><br/><b>Christopher Kubasik:</b>  Thanks for the recommendation of Kerr's book -- I'll try to track it down.<br/><br/>Also, I think I see what Dave (and others) may have been getting at -- yeah, I'm not sure Egri is really about "Here is Step 1 -- create your premise.  Once you've done this, move on to Step 2."  It's more "A good play has these characteristics" and he dissects those, but as to just how all those pieces get created and put together, yeah, he's mostly silent.  Hmmm.<br/><br/><b>Mike (again):</b> And finally, as Mike points out, the nitty-gritty process bits of playwriting might not really be all that applicable to story games as such anyway.  And, indeed, it's probably best to steer clear of Narr vs Sim tarpits for now.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks again, everyone -- this is helping me quite a bit.<br/><br/>--Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
