More rarely, I find they occasionally contain what could be a really neat idea.<br/><br/>I was just reading through one and found this:<br/><br/>"Being drunk in a game like this is not a good thing, the GM 'simulated' drunken behavior by letting each of the other players dictate what your character did for five minutes. So as my dwarf sang show tunes while dangling from a chandelier with a half-full spitoon on his head. The night at the Inn rolled on."<br/><br/>Thinking back on it, can you remember any inane/stupid rules you or your friends made up, that, in retrospect, might actually have been pretty cool ideas?<br/><br/>Having read that quote, do you now want to write "A Drinking Game: The RPG of Public Humiliation"?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134290/#Comment_134290" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T06:31:23+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  6:31AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Having read that quote, do you now want to write "A Drinking Game: The RPG of Public Humiliation"?</blockquote>\nNah.

Someone turned up to our gaming club with their 'alterations' to Space Opera (oh yes, old school) which had things like 'pubic hair density' and 'nipple width' as part of the 1001 different character variables we had to plough through.<br/>\n<br/>\nCircumstantial second - we altered the AD&amp;D; experience rules so that xp was accumulated as you adventured as soon as the monster was killed rather than at the end of the adventure. It required a tiny bit more book-keeping by the GM and some attention by the players but it meant that you could feasibly level in the middle of a combat. Many an adventurer was saved by a mid-fight 'ding' (again, long before we ever 'dinged' in a MMO!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCool last - I ran a long DC Heroes campaign which went through a number of 'seasons' (again, before we even knew we were doing them) with some of the players changing at the end of a season. However, they were still at the club and were interested in the progress of the campaign. We even posted a little club newsletter telling everyone what was going on. Oh God, I remember doing that. No computers then! Anyway, before senility sets in, we instituted a 'Guest Star' rule which meant that if someone who had been in the campaign who was 'between games' could squeeze into the game for one session as a guest star. It was very cool and kept me on my toes as a GM. The upshot of it came at the end of the campaign when the heroes had their apocalyptic confrontation withthe Shadow Lord Umbra. EVERYONE wanted to guest star, so I had to timetable them in. One of the guys was GMing another game and stopped his game as 'Sorry guys, I have to go and make the ultimate sacrifice to save the world. Back in 20 minutes!' as he pottered over to my table, sat down and had his character die protecting the others from the evil minions.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
