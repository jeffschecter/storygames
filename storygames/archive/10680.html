This made the games a lot longer, but also made it so it was possible to play with snotlings and / or goblins because you could just throw them at the opponent in waves hoping to take someone down sooner or later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236934/#Comment_236934" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T16:34:10+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  4:34PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2009 4:36PM by Simon_C.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that rule! It's there to make you prioritise your actions, to focus on less risky stuff first, and to limit turn lengths.<br><br>That said, I've spent a lot of time thinking about Blood Bowl hacks.<br><br>For example, instead of the normal turn order, give each player three to five "action" markers (I'm not sure on the right number here.  Probably five.).  Players take turns moving a single figure, and then placing an action marker on it.  You can't move a figure again once it's got a marker.  Once everyone has placed all their markers, pick them all up, and start again.  This means that you can focus on a small number of figures for a focused play, or move a larger number of figures more slowly.  You get the same prioritisation, but without the fear that blowing a single roll will ruin your whole play.  Also, turns are even shorter.  Downsides would be that once someone's knocked down, it's a big sacrifice to stand them up again (you might have to add another rule about free standups at a certain point).<br><br/>Another way might be to allow each player to only move seven figures per turn, and then give each player four or so "Blitz" tokens.  They can spend a blitz token at any point during the opponent's turn to roll a d6, adding the number of figures the opponent has moved that turn.  If they roll 7+, the opponent's turn ends early.  This mechanic gives you the same impetus to prioritise your actions, and the same uncertainty - you might drop a pass and then lose your turn.  It possibly adds too much randomness to the game.  Gambling on an early turnover could give you a big advantage.  You might have to fiddle with the roll to make it more predictable.<br/><br/>Also, Dyson, I won my local league with Goblins, using that rule.  Dodge + Stunty + Hope is a powerful combination.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236942/#Comment_236942" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T17:52:03+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  5:52PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played Blood Bowl, but I played Mordheim from Games Workshop, and there was a mechanic that my friend and I disliked so greatly, we designed our own game based off our miniatures. In Mordheim (and in some other games), you roll to see if your attack hits, you then have roll to see what damage is done and there was a third or fourth roll that I don't remember much about. Why the multiple rolls? What purpose does it serve to roll to see what die hit, then take those that hit and roll to see if they do damage. It seems to me that the purpose is to make the game seem more difficult that it really is. You increase the likelihood that nothing will happen on any given turn because you could hit, then do no damage. Or you could hit, do damage, but then on the last roll the damage is mostly unimportant (like a stun).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236943/#Comment_236943" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T17:59:48+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  5:59PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/mike">@mike</a>: I think that's largely a lack of creativity rather than a cogent design ethos.

First you compare your and your enemy's weapon skill, which gives you the difficulty of the roll (to hit), out of that roll, the dice that are successes are rolled again (this time against a difficulty based on your strength and the enemy's toughness), to see if you land any wounds. And after that the enemy can still roll his Armour save and his successes negate your wounds.<br/><br/>The whiff factor is craptastical.<br/><br/>Still in WHF it sort of works, because you're dealing with large units, which means you try to start your attack with as many dice as possible, but that possibly thins your ranks and so on, there is a lot to consider tactically. And the tons of dice rolled sort of convey the chaos of two 20+ units of spearmen clashing (or whatever). Using the same process for a skirmish game is rather less elegant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236987/#Comment_236987" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T08:53:49+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  8:53AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite><a href="/forums/profile/mike">@mike</a>: I think that's largely a lack of creativity rather than a cogent design ethos.
