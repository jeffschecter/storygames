We have some already available through BoxNinja, but I'm interested in more.<br/><br/>We are neither paying nor charging for adverts (naturally), and would be looking at probably a maximum of A6 (horizontal) adds, so we could get two on a page. We also don't expect any form of exchange agreement, though if you do want to advertise Solipsist in your future books, you are of course very welcome!<br/><br/>So if you are interested in advertising please let me know (by emailing stranger@teuton.org)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
