A couple of things, though, came up that I'm wondering how y'all who've played it might address them. Without putting in layers of complexity that needlessly complicate the simple beauty of the game, I'm curious how you might see something like<br/><br/>1) An extended duel or fight between one character and an arch-villain type, as Vance challenged Hollas to a sword-duel (the Vance character worked in a flashback/refresh scene in which he was actually an officer on the Hand, when then-Lt. Hollas demonstrated obvious cowardice in the face of fire, for which Vance was blamed). The duel ended up getting trumped by Naomi going ballistic on some Imperials, BUT I was curious as to how I should have done that: a series of rolls by the player vs. various "obstacles" I set, i.e., you slash at him, harming him slightly (diff level 2-3), and now he ripostes (roll vs. 2-3 to NOT take an injured state)?<br/><br/>2) On a related note, how would you handle PvP? In the midst of the escape from the brig, Kale and Snargle got into a ferocious argument over what to do, and whose fault it was as to why they were in the predicament, and were about to come to fisticuffs before I threw a squad of marines at them. I wanted to have the players resolve BOTH the squad attack and the fisticuffs as the same time, as sort of a comic sequence a la the crazy three-person swordfight in PotC 2, but alas, on the spot I couldn't think of a way to help them make it happen without bogging things down, so it turned into a straight fight. <br/><br/>I've got some other things I'm curious about, but that's a good start for "system" questions. I suspect that answers will go along the line of "just set obstacles for each element or action in the scene, and have the players roll accordingly," but I'm curious to see what other folks may have done differently.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233300/#Comment_233300" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T13:32:19+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  1:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Seems fine. I know that it might break some the tension but the one-roll works too. LB is pretty fast paced so Hollas can come back, even if he's left bleeding out on a burning Hand of Sorrow over taken by skysquid.<br/>\n<br/>\n2)There is no PvP. Make them act it out while you narrate the blow-for-blow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233315/#Comment_233315" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T16:08:57+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  4:08PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Nathan that things work as they are, but if you want to have some actual hacks to change the rules for these situations, I'd mostly use comparative rolls, that is, both sides roll and compare successes against each other.<br><br>1) Maybe have comparative rolls, with the winner earning the leftover successes, and an end to the battle once one of them reaches X successes?  As in, we both roll, I get 2 and you 3 successes, so now you've got 1 point on your way to 5 and I got 0. <br/><br/>2) If they need resolution, make it a simple comparative roll, I guess.  I'd still let the loser decide what that means for them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C" title="Tom C"><img alt="Tom C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C">Tom C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233402/#Comment_233402" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T07:24:27+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  7:24AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan &amp; Christian, thank you for the responses -- some helpful stuff there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
