                    I've been tangling with this for about a week, but I haven't gotten anywhere. Up until Brand posted his <a href="http://yudhishthirasdice.blogspot.com/2006/05/pullpush-moment-of-crisis.html" rel="nofollow">moments of crisis</a> clarification of push and pull, I thought I was following the whole discussion fairly well. And as I try to reinterpret what I've seen about push and pull in light of moments of crisis, I seem to be hitting a wall. It seems that push and pull are observable, while moments of crisis are not. But then how can the observable push and pull depend on the moment of crisis to be observed?<br/><br/>Now, likely I've got one of these two things wrong. Are push and pull things that can't be observed, so you don't know which you are using, if either? And if moments of crisis are meant to be observables then how do you observe them? How can you know when one happens, especially if their existence is subject to subsequent reinterpretation?<br/><br/>It's possible that my difficulties here are due to a deficiency in my cognitive technology. But its becoming clear to me that if I am going to build a moments of crisis detector I need more guidance on they ways they can be detected. As far as I can see, the alternative is to accept that push and pull is simply something I can't use.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><a href="http://darklordforhire.livejournal.com/8607.html" rel="nofollow">RPGs should not aspire to be art or fiction, they should aspire to transcend such things.</a> </div>

                            Mendel, <br/><br/>I just opened up comments on Yud's dice. Seeing as Andy's said he only wants p/p stuff on SG that's directly tied to AP, we should maybe move this dicussion over there.                        </div>
