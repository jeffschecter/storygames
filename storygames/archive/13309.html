So I've been wondering if there's some way to bring some of the same joy over.  What I'm looking for in particular is that collaborative storytelling - the feeling of some authorial control in the players hands, and the feeling that you produce a story in the end that might almost be worth sharing.<br/><br/>(You might ask - "Why put it in computers?  Why not just play the real thing?"  Same reason anybody plays videogames, I suppose - because it's hard to get a group of people together for it.)<br/><br/>My first thought is that it's just impossible:  Chris Crawford has been chasing story in videogames for ages with the Erasmatron.  And the Costikyan article mentioned in the other thread has some good points:  the more you want good story, the less game you've got - and while the latest crop of tabletop RPG's may be proving that wrong, it still seems to hold true for videogames.  Computers are good at refereeing games but they're terrible at creating stories.  The more authorial control you give the player the less storylike your stories get.  So CRPG's are all railroads, or, at best, efforts like Mass Effect where the only control you have is a mixture of choose-your-own-adventure and the ability to choose which section of the railroad you travel down next.  (Costikyan hypothesizes that the reason story games are becoming more popular now is because computers are particularly bad at them, but gamist games translate pretty well.)  <br/><br/>But, OTOH, if you'd asked me, I would have said Scribblenauts was impossible.  So maybe I just have to shut that part of myself up for now.<br/><br/>So...let's put on our mad scientist caps, do some brainstorming.  Can we make: Lady Blackbird, the computer game?  In a Wicked Age, the computer game?  Burning Wheel, the computer game?  (And here I'm *not* talking about bringing setting and color over, but mechanics!)  Or...something else entirely, that still has that same collaborative storytelling awesome?  What would it need?  Are there computer games that are making steps in this direction already?  Go!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299671/#Comment_299671" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-07T15:03:13+00:00" title="November  7, 2010  3:03PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked at <a href="http://sleepisdeath.net/" rel="nofollow">Sleep is Death</a>?

I think one of the keys of indie games is focusing on the traditional playgroup, 3-5 players, as the ideal number of characters to structure a story around and then empowering those 3-5 players to create their own sustainable fun within a narrative environment of varying complexity.<br/><br/>I have a hard time imagining why a single "instance" of My Life with Master (a master, a town) or Dogs in the Vineyard (a town, some problems that need resolving) couldn't be created as a video game, in which a group of players created characters and then explored the relatively open-ended "instance" in which there was no fixed solution, just a chain of causality and interaction between various parts.  The master would tell you to go kill X person and then you could decide to do it or not, leading to consequences for everyone involved.  You could even program a computer, in my mind, to create random instances: random masters, random towns, etc.  This would be important because a single master or town would probably only provide for a few hours of play.  There could be additional fun, though, in having your PC become the master in later instances of the same town, since that's one of the options in the endgame.<br/><br/>There are other ways, of course, to use some of the lessons we've learned in video games, like in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13069" rel="nofollow">the spy game I literally dreamed up in September</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299679/#Comment_299679" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-07T16:37:19+00:00" title="November  7, 2010  4:37PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a game wherein people design scenes/encounters/characters/big bads/etc and then get online where a program splices multiple players' modules together with a random plot outline and everyone plays through the combination together.  This way each player is a character and also the author of one part of the generated adventure.  At the end, people vote for which modules were the best so people are encouraged to keep making better adventure parts.

Examine how games like chess or GO create "stories" and how these mechanical systems naturally produce stories according to a narrative structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote I did not say games TELL a story, I said games CREATE a story. The issue is exceptionally confused in video games. video games that are said to have "story" usually focus on storyTELLING apart from the games mechaincs. Storytelling is entirely different from story generation. Storytelling is scripted, even if the script has branches or periods of non-liner interaction it's still the same script and there is always finite number of possible stories and limited replay, once you have read all the bits of a scrpit, found each obsure room or item, it gets old.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best current example of a video game that i would call a <i>story game</i> is left 4 dead. Each game tells the story of a group of idiots who think they are in a video game trying to survive a zombie attack. this is not an ideal story to tell, it would be better if the players stayed in character but it's a start. many people feel the best way to play left 4 dead is with a group of your friends, people that likely enjoy playing the game in the same manner as you do. This is a pretty clear sign of player involvement in the experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nas for what comes next?

What alows tabletop rpgs to be tabletop rpgs is the live, actual people at the table. I've tried to play in many chat games, but it never worked for me, because the dynamics fall apart. There is no real communication, there's no magic circle that we all enter and leave the rest of the world away.<br><br>PbP games work much better, imo, because we act in <i>Go</i>-es. I go, you go. We write up discrete bits of fiction that advance the story, then leave it up to the other guy to build on that. So, that's something to keep in mind.<br><br>So, if we take the next step, deeper into electronic territory, we leave the other people behind. It's just us and the computer. Unless you want to make a multiplayer game, but then we already have MMOs...<br><br>Where computers fail completely here, is to understand, process and judge language, translating it into fiction and vice versa. They fail even harder when it comes to emotional stuff. So while Jonathan's "Dogs videogame" above works for as long as you have an "open-ended instance/town with problems that the player can either solve or not", I don't think Dogs resolution would work at all. How does the computer know when there's a conflict? Who gets to make that judgement call? How does the computer decide whether your particular Raise was worth Seeing <i>in the fiction</i>? I guess it could be done, but I have no idea how.<br><br>Same with something like s/lay w/me. You could probably create a game that would understand and build upon a player's action/narration in a series of "goes", but the problem that we should solve (or completely discard and do something else entirely) would be: who gets to decide when I get a die or not? I don't think a computer is capable of that.<br><br>Lady Blackbird? Who decides when and which dice I can apply? It can probably be solved in a Scribblenauts-style fashion, where the computer would understand that your "burly" trait would apply to a wrestling match...then there's the question of Keys. Can you program the computer to understand that you've hit your key with a certain action? I suppose you can, but you'd have to put down a lot of restrictions.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age: who gets to say whether you're doing something with love? Can the computer interpret that?<br/><br/>Burning Wheel: who makes the distinction between intent and task? who determines whether you get artha for following your belief or being a moldbreaker?<br/><br/>Translating story games to the computer would mean solving the problem of moments of judgement about fiction. I think these mechanics above can be emulated by a computer, but it would require a lot of behind-the-curtain tricks. And it would still be just emulation.<br/><br/>Four videogames that I think are extremely relevant to this discussion: Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, Sleep is Death and Echo Bazaar. Emerging narrative, pre-set narrative. Open world, limited world.

There's even theory diagrams hashed out by me and Vincent!<br/><br/>Summary: <br/>The simplest way to create digital experiences that scratch the same itch as tabletop RPGs is to create digital games that support the same creative agendas. The tools available to digital games are vastly different from the tools available in tabletop gaming, and the nature of a scripted digital game limits the choices and options available to you in a way that the infinite improvisation of tabletop gaming just doesn't. The trick then is to approach the storytelling mechanisms in your digital games the same way you approach physics engines: both are tools that simulate reality in order to give a more immersive feeling to the game. People have been throwing a lot of money at physics engines for years, though, and progress on narrative engines isn't anywhere near that advanced.

It was actually a cool experience and produced some interesting stories, although I haven't gone back to it in a few months. <br/><br/>Trying to connect to friends was kinda maddening, and services to connect players with GMs far favored players over GMs: Register as a GM and you can find players right away. Register as a player, and you have to wait a long, loooong time.<br/><br/>I'll give it another try with friends later, when time permits (towards end of month, maybe?).<br/><br/>I liked it a lot, but I favored changing the config file to allow for 90-120 second turns to allow for more freedom. You can always end the turn early if you finish early. With 120 seconds (instead of 30) there were far less fuckups as a GM.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299723/#Comment_299723" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T06:54:51+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  6:54AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot of focus on new ways of playing games, and new definitions of "game", in the video games indie-stry. They even have their own indie circles, personas, flare-ups, innovations, figureheads (Dan Paladin is like a lovechild of Luke Crane and Clinton Nixon, laser-focused on video games), etc. <br/><br/>The best way to bring the "S-G experience" (as it were) to crpgs... is to become an independent console/computer game creator. Learn flash (or whatever lang supports the kind of platform you want to write games for). put your works together for 40+ hours a week, long weeknights and weekends. It's grueling work, even for simple-ish Flash games. But the only way to make your ideas resonate in the crpg world is not to talk at designers on their blogs and forums, but to step up and create a work yourself.<br/><br/>That's a LOT of work, tho.

It helps you create games ala the old Infocom text adventures, and it uses an interface and targeted "programming language" that uses normal English, in a shocking way. It's free, too, and works on all platforms.<br/><br/>There's also the RPG Maker VX/XP/etc series. While it looks like it allows you to make "anything... as long as it looks like early Final Fantasy drivel", the engine is actually pretty robust: You can create story-based scenarios with no combat, integrate full motion video or sound (some of ASCII's demo projects that shipped with the disk were extremely innovative and took the tool to new heights. Get a few artist friends together and a copy of the older XP or newer VX, and you could create some pretty wicked Miazaki-style games.<br/><br/>It's a lot of work.

It's not that a system would even need to understand a players speech, it could simply generate and give players a few options to pick from. picking these options should require a player to think of how that other character would react based upon previous interactions with that character. Basically dialog NEEDS to be core to the game play because stories have characters that say stuff and poke things. i have more ideas about how this works.<br/>\n<br/>\n"poke things" directed ecosystem<br/>\nPlenty of games have complicated ecosystems that can generate interesting stories. Figuring out a way to ensure something cool is happening and that when a player pokes something it really gets poked. mine craft generates terrain that is fun to explore, and i'm sure dwarf fortress is doing something cool (i have to take other peoples word for it though).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing the game would benefit from is something to keep people from playing it in a boring way, directing the structure of the story to prevent the game from becoming an endless sand box of unconnected scenes or events.<br/>\n<br/>\nlike if you had a game that functioned around a 3 act structure or something similar. like a game based around crime solving, each game is new case!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/warren" title="warren"><img alt="warren" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/GoPlayMario.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/warren">warren</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299978/#Comment_299978" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T05:57:47+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  5:57AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see Apocalypse World style moves working. Each move tends to follow a fairly fixed structure which specifies a clear trigger condition (they come under fire, they are an Angel who tries to heal a wound, they walk into the Burning Sands, etc.) and reasonably defined outcomes. Both of which could be programmed (I'm thinking a custom scripting language would be best, as that would give the developers the most flexibility and probably also allow for downloadable moves as extra content.)<br><br>The problem, as always, is defining what each NPC is thinking, and how that develops. Perhaps you could take Vincent's advice on hand and give each NPC a Front/Threat and a core (body-part) drive that's fairly hard coded (Dog is driven by his dick, so he will always look to get laid, for example).<br><br>The "GM AI" would mostly pick from the list of fronts, threats and the moves that makes available. Once it has chosen which front, threat &amp; move to apply to the player, it can look up what NPC(s) part of the chosen threat and (this is the hard bit) available to make the selected GM move. And have them do it.<br><br>I've been in the games industry since the late 90's, and I'm fully aware how difficult this would be to implement. But AW does seem to have some of the most "computer friendly" rules in an RPG that I've seen.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
