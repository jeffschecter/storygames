Couple things.<br/><br/>One, this weekend at <a href="http://strategicon.net" rel="nofollow">Gateway</a> in Los Angeles, the usual gang of SoCal Dungeon World-types who run Living Dungeon World will be doing it again. Sessions are Friday night (2), Saturday afternoon, Sunday afternoon (2), and Sunday night. It promises, as always, to be a good time.<br/><br/>Two, I finally got around to sorta-recapping the Living Dungeon World campaign we ran at Gamex, which immediately upon its conclusion was dubbed <i>Deus Ex Machina</i>. <a href="http://rollsomedice.blogspot.com/2012/08/gamex-2012-better-late-than-never.html" rel="nofollow">Check it out here.</a><br/><br/>Surprise third thing! If you were at GenCon, maybe you got a chance to pick up our preliminary-draft pamphlet on running Dungeon World the Living Dungeon World way. ...That's all. Not much of a thing, really. Just thought I'd mention it.<br/><br/>Anyway. Hope to see you at Gateway!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
