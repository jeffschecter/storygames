My next show is about Social contract. What do you think needs to be openly discussed, before playing, or when a new group is forming? Here's some things I'm thinking:<br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]Who gets to play? Whether you're allowing everyone who wants to play at the table, or if there is a vetting black ball process to adding new gamers.<br/>\n[*]The goals of play? Are you doing an old school dungeon delve, focusing on killing monsters, taking their stuff, overcoming puzzles, and no one cares your fighter is named Bob? Perhaps the name Bob is actually encouraged as ironically funny?<br/>\n[*]The power of the G.M? Are you using GM-Fiat, full on Narritivism, or something in between?<br/>\n[*]Appropriate stances? Some folks may not be cool with author stance decisions by players, or to restate in other terms meta-gaming.<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else am I missing? What does your group discuss before play? What kind of things does your group find verboten?<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: why does it always screw up my lists, I can't see my error.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Who can play.  I limit this a lot in my games because I am looking either for specific kinds of players or only for those that I know really well.  Example:  Started up a Redbox D&amp;D game a while back mainly as an introduction into gaming for my niece and nephew.  So I limited it only those that I know really well and then only those that could keep the play somewhat simple and not very graphic.  Ended up with five players (my niece, nephew, my brother who is their father, a cousin from their mothers side and an old school gamer who simply likes to have some fun in a game) and it has been going over great since.<br>\n<br>\n2 - We also discuss what kind of game it will be and how 'rules hardcore' it will be.  Most of my games I run really loose with the rules and reward imaginative and entertaining play.  Another guy runs things by the book all the time.<br>\n<br>\n3 - Lastly we discuss any kind of setting info that is relevent as some players just don't like certian things.<br>\n<br>\nMy two cents.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76280/#Comment_76280" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T17:46:02+00:00" title="June 17, 2007  5:46PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of my group's social contract is that we'll talk with the GM about what works and what doesn't.  This wasn't agreed upon as something that we hashed out beforehand, but came into being because I constantly put forth the question "What worked for you and what didn't?" -- that way if the game isn't working for someone, they don't have to do the initial push of bringing the subject up.  I'll also solicit suggestions to other GMs if they don't ask me for my thoughts as a player.  This has become part of what we do as a group.<br><br>Recently our group changed when I was teasing one player about how he's a crappy player to GM for, and then we talked about it and I flat out told him that I never wanted him in a convention game I run again.  Said player hasn't shown up to any games since, and most of us have decided that that's for the better.  We initially were trying to figure out the "who can play" problem because this player was ruining our fun, and eventually we settled on the social contract of "if we as a group have a problem with someone, Ryan will be the asshole voice of that problem."<br><br>I don't think we discuss a lot, but we've been playing for years and I've been pushing in ideas like this into our play.  My players are, for the most part, completely clueless on gaming theory, so we don't speak in those terms at all, so when I do ask questions, they're centered around the game and intended play -- "What sort of overall quest do you want to do?"  "How important are Nazis in my Spirit of the Century game?" etc.  If there's something important to me, I'll put that out on the line, like "Okay, so, we're playing Unknown Armies but I want to pull from the Cthulhu Mythos."<br/><br/>I'm also explicit about the sorts of attendance a game requires.  I'll tell folks that a game can be come-as-you-please, or that it's a situation where if someone can't so up I'll postpone the game.  The games I prefer to run are intense, character-driven dramas that require continual player involvement, so I'll outline this from the start and I'll balance this with a problem to run it for only a short number of sessions (say, 4 to 6).<br/><br/>But that's about all I do, because hammering out an explicit social contract is a bit tiresome when, if you have the right folks, it can be arrived at out of the experience.  Furthermore, spending time to hammer out a social contract is not the idea of fun for the casual gamer -- this is why I don't even use the term "social contract" with my friends when we're answering questions.  Instead, it's "campaign creation."  I just sneak social contracts in there, sometimes unknowningly.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76326/#Comment_76326" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-17T23:48:56+00:00" title="June 17, 2007 11:48PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Clyde<br/><br/>Besides what you're interested in talking about, I would like to hear your opinion on:<br/><br/>1) When do you need to create a 'formal' social contract?; and also, why do you need to create a social contract?<br/>2) Besides who gets to play, who gets to GM and why?

Is this a game where the PCs are more-or-less assured to be victorious?  Or is this a game where the PCs (and players) are going to have to work for their success?  Cause there's nothing that sucks more than walking into a game intending to play a badass and finding out that he's going to get his ass handed to him repeatedly.  Nothing sucks more except walking into a game intending to get your ass handed to you repeatedly and then just blowing away the 'opposition'.<br/><br/>Tone is also a biggie.  Is this a 'serious' game?  Is this a ha-ha funny game?  I'm perfectly fine with all points along the spectrum, but I'm not fine with mixing emotional drama with fart jokes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce" title="MtFierce"><img alt="MtFierce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/5582955/1136400"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce">MtFierce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76459/#Comment_76459" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T12:03:20+00:00" title="June 18, 2007 12:03PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I'm having to do a lot with on a social level with my usual gaming suspects is, "At what point can we change the character?"
