I'm considering running AW again, but I want to make sure it's still fresh and interesting. New players and playbooks will certainly go a long towards that. But I also have a desire to change up the setting significantly. This could mean everything from a "green" apocalypse (The Last of Us, Summerland) to a snowbound one (Snowpiercer). The idea I'm most interested in right now is taking a more sci-fi route, with the game being set on an alien planet or a decaying space station. <br/><br/>I'd call this less of a full hack and more of reskin, in the vein of a genre shift like Fallen Empires. Players are still the most interesting characters at work in a specific community in both FE and in what I'm discussing. Most PbtA hacks move away from the community-centric politics that I believe are at the heart of AW, but I'd hope to retain that in this reskin. I'd even keep the psychic maelstrom. That's why I don't necessarily want to utilize any of the many existing sci-fi PbtA games.<br/><br/>Running AW on an alien planet would probably work as-is, especially since Earth in AW is usually alien enough to begin with. My question, then, is what you see as the potential pitfalls and opportunities of setting a game on a post-apocalyptic space station? What would you change to support the genre?<br/><br/>The first things that spring to mind is the reduced significance of vehicles, assuming zero-g dogfights aren't a focus. This cuts the Chopper down into a rabble-rousing gang leader, rather than a mobile threat, and makes the Driver almost superfluous. But maybe selecting those playbooks would mean space travel becomes a going concern. I'm also wondering whether the lack of external arrivals might hurt the drama. After all, the new warlord can't invade a space station as easily as they might a landbound hardhold. <br/><br/>Does anyone have experience with running AW or any game in such a circumscribed environment? Maybe on a defunct cruise ship or some other non-standard setting? The only game I've seen which adapts a concept similar to this one is the Malandros-Drama System hack Gangs of Titan. Any resources or similar concepts would be much appreciated!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468927/#Comment_468927" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T07:14:04+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  7:14AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing that came to mind was <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Dead_Space" rel="nofollow">Dead Space</a> (unrelated to the video game of the same name), an old GURPS setting someone cooked up on 4chan way back in the day (there's a download link at the bottom of the article).<br/><br/>Very, very bleak. Homeless people living in huge nearly-dead space stations, scrounging whatever they can and killing each other for the water in their bodies.<br/><br/>Maybe not what you had in mind, but there could still be some ideas or inspiration worth mining. Now that I think about it though it could make for a really interesting AW hack; I always felt it was lacking as a GURPS setting, but some PbtA influence could really instill some focus and meaning to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Raticle" title="Raticle"><img alt="Raticle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Raticle">Raticle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468928/#Comment_468928" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T08:07:16+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  8:07AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I took a look at the wiki page and downloaded the book, this definitely looks like it captures the tone of people who live on a huge technological ark they no longer understand. It also does a good job paying attention to the inherent claustrophobia of such an environment. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'll adapt any of the unique setting conceits (especially because those are the sort of thing I'd leave up to the group to define), but I'm interested to see how it deals with the practicalities of such an existence. Definitely a useful resource, thanks!<br/><br/>Makes me wonder how large a hardholder's territory would be if it was entirely interior.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468931/#Comment_468931" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T19:06:38+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  7:06PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2018 7:13PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that, for the most part, it will work very well "as-is", except for the issue of scale.<br/><br/>Converting a "hardhold" into a "space station" is just colour, after all. But are you OK with the idea of a "space station" holding several hundred people and having enough space for a Chopper's gang to travel around, a Driver's vehicle, and so forth?<br/><br/>That could be interesting on its own. A "space vehicle" for a Driver, which travels between space stations, could also be very interesting. (I normally don't like Drivers, but this would make one quite interesting to me.)<br/><br/>If you imagine smaller, more confined spaces, then you just might want to get rid of some of those playbooks, on the other hand (or rewrite them accordingly).<br/><br/>Having said all that, there has been at LEAST one AW game played on a space station that I'm aware of. Let me see if I can find some info...<br/><br/>EDIT: Here we go!<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=1575.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=1575.0</a><br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6666.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=6666.0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468936/#Comment_468936" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-15T20:30:07+00:00" title="January 15, 2018  8:30PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I immediately pictured my Driver as having jetpacks.

A lot of the environment would be depend on the players' choices of playbook, as befits AW. I'm leaning towards just pitching it with the space station idea and seeing how it develops from there.<br/><br/>For example, if no one picks the Driver, maybe no one leaves the station regularly. If they do, maybe the Driver is some sort of explorer who scavenges wrecks, space objects, or even planets.<br/><br/>Those threads, particularly the first one, look like exactly what I'm thinking of! Thanks for digging them up. Having a few custom moves to represent the environment will go a long way towards making it unique. <br/><br/>On a slightly different note, I had a related idea about following the soldiers and/or staff manning a space station near some hostile border or threatening phenomena. Sounds like a good setup for a different sort of game, but the closest thing to that seems to be the defunct Souls of Steel hack which petered out a few years ago.<br/><br/>I suppose I've had space stations on the brain since I finished playing Prey and heard a number of my friends saying good things about Tacoma. And I love a good hub location.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468970/#Comment_468970" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-16T10:47:18+00:00" title="January 16, 2018 10:47AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The first things that spring to mind is the reduced significance of vehicles, assuming zero-g dogfights aren't a focus.</blockquote> <blockquote>I'm also wondering whether the lack of external arrivals might hurt the drama.
