I am most fascinated by <b>\xc1ureos</b>, a game about Capoeira fighters. I do like the Spanish <b>1800: El Ocaso de la Humanidad</b> project as well as the Swedish <b>Neotech Edge</b>. The latter might even get an English translation in the long run.<br/>As for the German games, I do gladly support the translation of <b>Dread</b> by System Matters. I am as well intruiged to play a gamebook by, traditional, mail as <b>Schwarzkalten</b> suggests.<br/><br/>Though the core and bulk of this collection, as usual, are still the English games.<br/>I am most intruiged and did back <b>Familiars of Terra</b>. On the one hand because it features quite a lot of cute pets, on the other hand I am intruiged by the system which took notes from PbtA and Blades in the Dark. In regards of Story games you might like to check out <b>The King is Dead</b>, all about the succession of a kingdom, by Vincent and Meguey Baker. Well, or take a look at <b>Wingless</b>. A Powered by the Apocalypse game about angels.<br/><b>Uprising</b> shouldn\u2019t go without a mention either. It is a game featuring the Fate system whose setting forms from social deduction games The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution. Well, and as we are already in the dark future, maybe take a look at <b>Battlecruiser Alamo RPG</b>. The newest game in the era gameline.<br/>Next to those classical tabletop rpgs I am quite fascinated by the <b>Graphic Novel Adventures</b> gamebook or lets say comicbook. I do like the concept and the realization and artstyle looks cool, I am on the verge of backing.<br/>Fans of Torg should take a look at the <b>Torg: Eternity</b> supplement, while those who are into Exalted 3rd Edition might take interest in the <b>Dragon-Blooded</b> project by Onyx Path.<br/>There are plenty more projects. The very cute <b>Wee Beasties</b> children book, the helpful <b>Backstory Cards</b>, the <b>Metaphor Dice</b> and plenty of projects more., notebooks, dice, pins etc\u2026 take a look:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Mail Gamebook<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Science Fiction / Dark Future Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>5 Supplements<br/>3 Supplements for D&amp;D<br/>1 Campaign<br/>3 Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>1 Dice Accessoire<br/>1 Coin Projects<br/>2 Notebooks<br/>4 RPG (Playing) Cards<br/>3 (Enamel) Pins<br/>3 RPG Books (Children Book, Artbook, Comic)<br/>2 Various RPG Projects<br/>4 Various Other Games<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 RPG Novel<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Dice Tower<br/><br/><b>Portugese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>8 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Translations of Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Fanzine<br/>1 Community Page<br/>1 RPG Novel<br/><br/>Link: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/04/08/crowdfunding-collection-73/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/04/08/crowdfunding-collection-73/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473011/#Comment_473011" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-29T20:32:25+00:00" title="April 29, 2018  8:32PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new<b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/04/29/crowdfunding-collection-74/" rel="nofollow"> Crowdfunding Collection no. 74, including every tabletop project started between 04.08 and 04.29.</a></b><br/><br/>Given my live and a ton of cool news from White Wolf regarding the 5th edition of Vampire: The Masquerade culminating the current <a href="https://www.modiphius.net/collections/vampire-the-masquerade" rel="nofollow">pre-oder at Modiphius</a> I took a little time with this crowdfunding collection. Which features no less than 54 projects.<br/><br/>A project that I backed in a blink of an eye was the <b>Jubil\xe4umsausgaben zu Vampire</b> from Ulisses Spiele. It does offer not only the German translation of Vampire: The Dark Ages 20th but a total of 9 supplements.<br/>Of the many other I backed the Patreon for a <b>RPG about Nahuales</b>. A Powered by the Apocalypse Role-Playing Game about the Nahuales, mythical creatures originated from the Mexican culture. I am quite fascinated by Welcome to Yarnia, as it is the first RPG to combine knitting and role-playing gaming. Next to those there are a plenty other interesting tabletop rpgs being funded like <b>Overlight, An Atlas of the Horizons, Journey Away, Nagual, Star Crossed, Faxions, Endless Realms, Shattered Tower</b> and <b>Black Void</b>. Yet the gamebook <b>GameTale </b> is interesting as well as the social deduction / party rpg games.
