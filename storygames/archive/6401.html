It was originally supposed to be a Delta Green game (and I thank Dave Younce so freaking much for suggesting the system), but as over the top as it was, it really became something of its own beast - more like Hellboy than anything else.<br/><br/>We really only got through the Zero and First acts of the game in the limited time we had. Still, we made it to an exciting brawl and everyone left the table happy.<br/><br/>The first thing I did was to define a Leader for the group. Usually a GM might have a scene in mind for all of his characters' Zero Acts (since the group would have done a setting and character creation session beforehand). I had one defined for the Leader, and made sure that this Act was played out last. I focused the players on their characters and tried to help find a defining moment to explore. I let them do some free description of their characters and quickly determined a scene frame to explore something that leapt out at me. It worked pretty well, especially with the later players as they saw how it worked.<br/><br/>Then, when I reached the Leader, we got to spotlight the whole setting. I had the Leader be part of a dive team trying to blow up R'lyeh before as part of an international dispute over an oil rig that hit what man wasn't meant to witness. He battled his way through the complex only to discover his first in command had been possessed by an artifact. That is, his BROTHER had picked up a WICKED COOL MAGIC SWORD. Long story short, they battled to the death. His brother was reanimated, and as R'lyeh rose, he pushed the Leader to freedom through a glowing portal with dimensions that made no sense. Did I mention that this was New Years, 1999? The Leader was plunged back in time to found the organization which would eventually hire the characters.<br/><br/>So, then, the Leader gets to tell everyone what they're role on the team is. Not only is this cool because it makes the Leader seem like he knows what he's talking about, he also knows from the players what they do in certain situations and their roles make sense. I also stole a mechanic from one of Andy's games called Ghost Killers wherein the players get free successes for following what the Leader told them to do (using a Strategy roll from the player as necessary).<br/><br/>The line up and further details to follow.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
