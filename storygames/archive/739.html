                    Jonathan <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/05/character-framing-restrictions-keys.html" rel="nofollow">posted something about chakra keys</a> that has some really cool implications.  Some games like TSOY have goals that, when fulfilled, allow for character development; they give XP.  However, those are single things; imagine what you could do if you had story arc elements that people can earn and chain together in different ways to then trade for character development!<br/><br/>That idea begs for examples.  Say you have a list of certain character events, such as "falls in love," "gets smacked down," "shows respect to an elder," "fulfills revenge," "sacrifices a friend," "backstabs an ally," etc.<br/><br/>Now, during play, your character earns some of these events due to what happens and the choices they make.  Not very often; maybe one or two per session.  The most significant events, in other words.<br/><br/>There are also chains of events--let's call them arcs--that are listed in the rules or made up before play by the players, such as "falls in love"+"gets rejected"+"heartbroken rage"+"gives up love"... OR... "falls in love"+"gets rejected"+"pursues love"+"gets rejected"+"pursues love"+"wins over love".<br/><br/>The player can then trade in established chains for character development!  The events and chains work INSTEAD OF experience points, so that your character development is all story-organic and shit.  And if you want to get crunchy, shorter and longer chains give different rewards, or you could even have certain things only available through particular chains (such as a "hero" reputation, a "jaded" ability, a "ruthless" advantage, etc.).  If you want the "Dark Side Powers" ability, you need to go down a chain that includes anger, suffering, betraying people, killing innocents...<br/><br/>Minor issues to be worked out include whether those events should all be active choices (e.g., "fulfills revenge") or include the fate the character hasn't chosen as well (e.g., "is rejected").  The first makes choices more meaningful, the second allows for rewards even when the character fails at something.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought this had some potential.                </div>

                            Christian, this makes me think about Burning Wheel Lifepaths.<br/><br/>Maybe you could just list of individual links, and have each link have a list of other links that you can do next?  And if completion of each link gave some minor reward, you could build them together into something grand.<br/><br/>Something like:<br/><br/><b>Rejection</b><br/>Someone you care about rejects your value in their life.<br/><i>Gain two Anger and one Desperation.</i><br/>Links to: Rededication, Revenge, Outburst<br/><br/>Hey, I can even see something along the lines of having each player select one link for each scene, and so you have like four or five different links that that scene functions as.  If you wanted to get really complicated, have a mechanic where only one or two of them actually count, and the other players have to pick something else for the next scene...                        </div>

You could have links... but then you'd be quite restricted in where you can go from there. Maybe links that don't exclude the rest, but facilitate the linked events.<br/>
<br/>
That would certainly be easier than writing out a whole load of chains...                        </div>

                            I'm really interested in having players try to make a given scene one thing, and then get denied, so the next scene they have to do something else.  So I just succeeded in completing a Rejection scene (Scene 1); in the next scene (Scene 2), I want to go all true-love Rededication and win back the girl, but I get denied.  So in Scene 3, I <em>can't</em> try and be the goody-goody, I <em>have</em> to either seek Revenge or have an Outburst -- or at least try.                        </div>

                            You know what? Now that I think on it, that's a good idea for a related reason: pacing. By linking things up, you actually drive the story forward. I guess there could be some conclusion events that maybe then free you up to pick the next one freely.                        </div>

                            Exactly -- although I think just about any link could be a 'conclusion' just as much as any other -- it's all a matter of what kind of a story you're after.  However, to facilitate players being able to coordinate the story that they're after, some sort of explicit and transparent counter (there are four scenes left) should probably be featured somewhere.  Otherwise I'll be halfway through my violent retribution arc while the rest of the players at the table are finishing up their arcs, leaving me high and dry.                        </div>

                            This was pretty much the germ-of-a-concept that led me to start poking at Perfect Blossom. It's substantially trickier than it looks, in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
The "open" version - sort of Scene Keys or Story Arc Keys - is cool and not that tricky. I've got a deck of cards somewhere around here that I've tried a few times that basically works that way.  When you start trying to link them up and tie them to resource flows for pacing. Ook. My brain broke.                        </div>

                            The way this sprang to mind for me when I read Jon's original post was pretty cool:<br/><br/>You have these Key-like things, and they provide some rewards when you resolve them, sort of like Joshua's example above.  But then, instead of a "may go to" list, you have a "get a bonus of X if you go to Y" list.  That way you can let a thread die off if it's no longer interesting, but there are some really good reasons to follow the listed progression.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Glad people are digging it.<br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot about structuring player input as a way of creating a distinct sense of character and this is part of that on-going exploration.  Traditional play would have us define what characters CAN do, when this is instead looking at what characters WOULD do.  You limit the kinds of choices characters can make instead of the likelihood or degree to which they can succeed at various tasks.<br/><br/>So instead of having a set of abilities, you collect various options that are open to the character and so the player, by making some choices, closes certain roads and open others (which is what <a href="http://100flowers.indie-rpgs.com/waiting-tea.pdf" rel="nofollow">Waiting/Tea</a> was trying to model on a micro-level).<br/><br/>Personally, I think this has the possibility, in certain games, of not just supplementing traditional attribute systems, but completely replacing them, to the point of rendering them unnecessary if the possible character choices are structured well enough.  Obviously, you could also use them like Keys or Spiritual Attributes (from <i>Riddle of Steel</i>) and help structure more traditional play.  But that's not where my interest really lies, being a subversive design junkie <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In any case, I kinda feel like I've been talking about this for a while, but if people are just starting to get it now, that's awesome!  Woohoo!  Thanks to Christian for obviously being a better communicator than me.                        </div>

                            Some other thoughts I had this morning:<br/><br/>Consider computer-based adventure games, from <i>Zelda</i> to <i>Final Fantasy</i>.<br/><br/>You're on a quest to reassemble the Master Sword.  It's not just some crazy, open-ended thing.  First you have to complete step A, then step B, then step C, and then, once you get to step H, you get the Master Sword.  Of course, playing these games, I often wished things were less strictly ordered, so you could do step E and then step B and then step G, etc.  And that's where you could swap various "chain links" around or, like Christian said, improvize the necessary chain out of a handful of options.<br/><br/>Now, just switch this over to a character development model, instead of just developing your ability to kick ass.  You're a nice innocent farm boy, like Luke Skywalker at the beginning of <i>Star Wars</i> or Taren in <i>The Book of Three</i>.  Luke ends up becoming a Jedi,which means more than just kewl powerz; it means a serious shift in his character and personality.  Likewise, Taren eventually becomes the High King of the whole world.  Now going from farm boy to supreme leader is a long process, so you probably want to break it down into steps.  Start with say, <b>Farm Boy -&gt; Competent Warrior</b>.  It's like multiclassing in <i>D&amp;D</i> or chosing a new occupation in <i>Warhammer Fantasy</i>, but this is less about getting the skills or powers of a warrior and more about <b>framing the experiences that will help turn your farm boy into a warrior</b>.  And this can be a fixed series of steps or a more general structure that's open to a lot of moving things around.<br/><br/>Note too that it should be totally possible to change your goals mid-stream.  You complete a few chain links and then decide you want your character to become more of a lover than a fighter.  Well, ideally, you should still be able to draw on your past experience (your completed chain links) to move towards that as well.  Anybody remember the <i>Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game</i> with its "lines of experience?"  You would write down important things that you did and gain experience from them.  This is like that, except that the kinds of things you can do are predetermined, so you're trying to meet various requirements instead of retroactively recalling the neat stuff you did.<br/><br/>Also, consider how cool it is to have <b>requirements involving failure</b>.  Normally, in roleplaying, failure isn't always especially fun, because it doesn't necessarily drive the story anywhere.  <i>Dogs</i>' Fallout was one solution to this, creating baggage from failure that's sure to crop up later and create more interesting situations.  Chain links involving failure, though, allow you to progress as a character by getting your ass handed to you or having fate not be on your side.  Wanna become a warrior?  Well, a good way to get that motivation would be having someone destroy everything you love and humiliate you at the same time.  Look, now you have a desire for revenge.  Isn't that handy?<br/><br/>Think about most American martial arts or sports movies.  <i>The Karate Kid</i>.  <i>Rocky</i>.  <i>The Mighty Ducks</i>.  The main characters usually have to lose a fair amount in the beginning in order to make their comeback (after a montage sequence where they get better) even more significant and exciting.  Now you can have mechanics where the characters have to fail a lot in order to finally succeed.  This was my point about many of the characters in <i>Avatar</i> (and a lot of kids shows), who have to fail so that they can learn how to get better.  Kids shows are about teaching lessons and showing kids how to learn from their mistakes.  Also, they try to teach abstract thinking and problem solving, not just looking for the obvious solution.  So, in <i>Avatar</i> the obvious solution almost never works.  Instead, like Rebecca Borgstrom says in <i>Nobilis</i>, you gain energy through adversity.<br/><br/>More later, as I continue to ponder this.                        </div>

<p>Jon, um, this is very sanguine, but I'm not really sure I agree. At its heart this stuff is entertainment, and it's appealing to the tastes of its audience. Young kids aren't generally very good at stuff that <em>isn't</em> lateral thinking, in my observation. Lateral thinking's entertaining to them.</p>
<p>Sorry for the mild hijack.</p>
<p>To application: Adversity and lateral problem-solving are really entertaining. How are you, Jon, going to empower players to create these with this character framing technique? On a high level I see <strong>Farm Boy &gt; Competent Warrior</strong> has a length of steps in between, but what sorts of tools do I have that help me make concrete instances of abstract points like <strong>Learning From His Mistake</strong>?</p>

<p>There are two ways to play with this type of system though, right?  One is Top-Down ("Here's where you want to go, so do steps A, B and C") and the other is Bottom-Up ("Here's where you are ... you can do A, D or F and they have consequences down the road ... what looks best to you right now?")</p>
<p>I think Dirk's comment about the FF-X Sphere Grid is a very keen one, and one that I'd like to elaborate a bit:  The <strong>topology</strong> of the links between things is going to push people in one direction or another on the Top-Down/Bottom-Up axis.</p>
<p>If you have long strings with comparatively few branches ("Okay, you can do A ... and then your only sensible choices after that are B, C, D, E, F and G or else you can do H, and then your only sensible choices are I, J, K, L and M") then people will have a more structured and constrained experience (if they want to seek the benefits of the system) but fewer choices.  Much as the word is overloaded, this is the basic setup of a railroad system.  You pick where you're going to go, and then you ride the rails.</p>
<p>By comparison, a system with short strings, many branches and constant interweaving gives people substantially more choices, at the cost of clear structure.  Sure, I'm a Farm-Boy who has become a competent warrior, but where the hell do I go next?  So.  Many.  Options!</p>
<p>FF-X has a fascinating balance:  strings of three to four items, connected together like spaghetti.  This gives choices and structure, though both in moderation.</p>
<p>Deep stuff!  I like how the mathematics of how things are connected can translate into a play experience in terms of how people feel.  What would the ability to dynamically create paths (as Christian suggested) do in terms of changing that experience?</p>

                            Wow.  <br/>
<br/>
Really, wow.  Cool stuff all over this thread.<br/>
<br/>
Some piddly two cents that I have on hand: It's probably because I recently ran a TORG game (I know, archaic, but it seemed like a good game to start broadening my group's gaming repertoire from D20--card mechanic, less hack and slash driven...anyway), but a card mechanic could do neat stuff here.<br/>
<br/>
Most especially: cards have use in game for mechanical reasons but also come with chaining opportunities.  I'm thinking something pretty simple right now, but maybe it could get fancier:<br/>
<br/>
Card comes up.  Top of card has description of action it allows or gives bonuses to, bottom half of card has 'buy in' option to a chain or step on a chain.  In other words, get bonus to do something smart, spend character point to buy into 'smart guy' story arc (which includes cool options later on like 'making a terrible mistake by presuming your smartness is infallible').  <br/>
<br/>
Why the card mechanic?  Well, it acts as a rotating prompt--player sees a card and starts thinking about how they could drive their character down that arc.  It also fosters a multiple arc character--something that allows for more cooperation in game.  Think: "Well, my current arc doesn't seem to quite fit with the current drive of the story, but I see how I could take this arc, play it through a while, then pick up my old one when..."                        </div>

<b>Dirk/Tony:</b> <i>FFX</i> is a great example of this kind of structure used for power/ability development, while the overall narrative of the game remains rather linear.  Imagine what would happen if the plot of the game was mapped on the Sphere Grid, so you constantly had the option of making different choices and following different narrative arcs.  Tony, you're totally right that having lots of intersecting arcs would open up choices more.  Still, it would make sense for there to be linear development in some areas and more web-like development in others, don't you think?  <br/><br/>I mean, if you want to be a cooper, you first have to find find a barrell-maker, apprentice to them, spend a few years learning how to make barrells, and then set up your own cooper shop.  There wasn't really any other viable option for doing it.  Or if you wanted to, like, steal the secret cooper arts from the Illuminated Barrell-Making Manual, you'd be intentionally deviating from the established path, using some special rule to skip certain links or switch one out for another.  So I can see some benefit in having expected linear paths that the characters use special rules/powers to deviate from.<br/><br/>Like, imagine a path for "proper womanly behavior" in a game about ancient China.  You live a chaste, sheltered girlhood, marry someone rich and influential, and have lots of sons.  But then Hua Mulan comes in and alters that path completely, which is a huge narrative statement in and of itself.  So I think there are clear benefits to having some (but all not) fixed paths, even if you expect characters to be constantly breaking them.<br/><br/><b>Shreyas:</b> I guess I cynically think cartoon designers try to shove condescending "educational" content into the stories where it doesn't necessarily belong.  When you compare American cartoons to Anime, it seems (to me) pretty clear that this is often the case.  But for whatever reason, lateral thinking is definitely something required from the main characters.  I suppose it doesn't really matter why.<br/><br/>I haven't quite thought all the way to implementing links in play yet.  Give me a few days and I might be able to whip up an example structure for an <i>Avatar</i> episode.<br/><br/><b>Matt:</b> Yes, credit to Matt for coming up with the "chains of Keys" idea.  I even posted to that thread and I didn't pay enough attention to that.  Maybe it just sunk into my subconscious for a while...                        </div>

                            What a great way to think of this. This is the stuff.  I've been thinking about this in terms of resolving kickers into new ones. Frex: moving from one to a new one in Sorcerer, or choosing a new Issue after your spotlight episode in PtA.  <br/><br/><i>Chain links involving failure, though, allow you to progress as a character by getting your ass handed to you or having fate not be on your side. Wanna become a warrior? Well, a good way to get that motivation would be having someone destroy everything you love and humiliate you at the same time. Look, now you have a desire for revenge. Isn't that handy?</i><br/><br/>I've been watching a lot of Buffy the Vampire slayer lately, and this is exactly the course of character development that happens in it. Again, back to Matt, the characters have issues they are dealing with which as soon as they resolve them, they escalate into something even more heinous and revealing than the last.   <br/><br/>If we hook up resolution mechanics into this we get another switch. Instead of mechanics that create a static situation from a dynamic one (by resolving a conflict), what if we had mechanics that take you from dynamic to new dynamic situation instead?  Or that build tension for your overall arc as they resolve tension from smaller conflicts? Character action can invest resources in the key that brings it to a head &amp; make it explode into something different.                        </div>

<p>Like, instead of simple choice points ("You can go from A to B, C or D") you get two different menus of choice points depending on how you resolve a big conflict?  "If you win the argument with Uncle Owen then you can go from Farm Boy to 'Academy Cadet' or 'Rebel Instigator', but if you lose it you have to choose between 'Sulky monkey-boy' or 'Resigned famer.'"</p>

                            Thanks, Tony. : ) And, totally. Then, smaller conflicts could set you up for bigger ones. Finding old Ben means that you've left your aunt and uncle vulnerable. You asked to get off this dirt ball, but now that your family's dead, what else can you do but join the rebellion? Instead of goal oriented mechanics &amp; plot, you have character development as the organizing principle.                        </div>

                            Yes.<br/><br/>Also, we've only been talking about single-character development so far.  What I modeled in <i>Waiting/Tea</i> is that, in any relationship, the characters have a significant degree of power over the choices available to each other.  If Bobby falls for Susy, unless she reciprocates, he's limited to options like "unrequited love," "jealousy," "find someone new," etc.  So social relationships progress only paths that are mutually determined by the choices of multiple characters, and not just the ones involved in the relationship.<br/><br/><i>Avatar</i> example!  Aang and Katara are making puppy eyes at each other!  Sokka comes in and makes fun of them!  He pushes them into the "feel awkward and embarrassed" stage.  They both blush and look away.  Katara then gives an angry retort about Sokka never having kissed girls.  Look, she's pushed the "feel awkward and embarrassed" development stage back on Sokka!  How cool is that?!  Pushy attacks of character development!<br/><br/>"Unwanted" character development is a potentially cool idea too.  How often do characters want to become a certain kind of person, but then circumstances or social pressures push them into becoming something they never expected?                        </div>

                            This all seems like the thematic bateries from FLFSwriten more genericly. to take it up a notch, what if your character creation included some sort of story path like "young man grows into hero" or "old man gearing up for one last try at greatness" or " outgrowing the traditional role society gave me".<br/><br/>I have been reading at the book "The Seven Basic Plots" ( I don't remember the Author and it is back at the library) but one of the things which becomes clear reading the book is that there are paths which make stories feel right and paths which would make them feel wrong. there is something here which goes with all that let me think some more.                        </div>

<blockquote>Yes, credit to Matt for coming up with the "chains of Keys" idea. I even posted to that thread and I didn't pay enough attention to that. Maybe it just sunk into my subconscious for a while...</blockquote>
Heh, re-reading my post came across as a bit of a "but that was my idea!" whining. Which wasn't the intent. I tried several ideas for the concept, and it just kinda stalled cos so many of the chains end up cross-weaving and biting their own tails. <br/><br/>I'd really like to see somebody take the idea and do it right. That person ain't me at the moment, maybe when Covenant is done and dusted...                        </div>

                            Wasn't there a thread back at the forge about how our current mode of thinking of structure works in the opposite way from dramaturgic structure.<br/>
<br/>
RPG structure: Overcome - character gets stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Drama structure: Overcome - situation gets worse.<br/>
<br/>
Or as Emiliy put it: "mechanics that take you from dynamic to new dynamic situation instead"<br/>
<br/>
This has been buzzing about inside my brain since way back then. But now I can't find that thread. I once had a mechanism for Source Code that went like this:<br/>
Character overcomes - plotclock ticks forward<br/>
Character fails - plotclock stays, character grows<br/>
And the idea was that when the plot-clock reached certain values certain game rules would change. <br/>
This kinda grew out of this whole idea about adversity growing as you overcome obstacles.<br/>
<br/>
Now I see you guys bringing up this. And this makes me go Hummmmm more powerfully than ten buddist monks at a meditation seminar. <br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to combine this type of thinking, Xenopulse's arcs and TonyLB and Emiliy's points. I need to sleep on this with an idea. I had one but the kid is crying and now its gone.<br/>
<br/>
Poooffff.<br/>

                            While I think that kind of thinking is prevalent in a lot of RPG designs, Kaare, I don't think that it's endemic to this schema.  At least when I'm talkinga bout this stuff, I'm not thinking that the <em>characters</em> necessarily get any stronger after each kind of "link", but I do think that the character sheet changes, which may or may not give the <em>player</em> additional resources, tools, and options.                        </div>

                            Well, off the top of my head:  What if the Situation is the avatar of the GM, in the same way that the character is the avatar of the PC?  Then "The plotclock ticks forward" sort of corresponds to the Situation growing.  Yes/No/Maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Then you can look at it and say "In any conflict, one side is going to lose (and grow) and the other side is going to get some resources for temporary dominance, but stay static."  That works when the GM wins (characters grow) and when the players win (Situation grows) and even, I suspect, for PvP conflicts not involving the GM.                        </div>

                            I need to work on this idea some more, all this indie hippie new age nonsense is nice but there's a simpler idea at the core of this that could easily be applied to any mainstream game you care to name, if only I could get to it.                        </div>

                            Here's the bare-bones of how I did something like this as an add-on for a fairly conventional game. I started with a set of Whimsy Cards (anybody remember those?). Cards with a variety of short, punchy dramatic elements on them, meant to spur creativity. I took some of those, wrote some of my own, and welded on a "fate point" type mechanic. Typically, the card could be played by adding something to a scene that referenced the concept on the card. You could either have it affect your own stuff (in which case you gained a point or two from the bank) or you could play the card and pay another player to have it affect something they owned.<br/>
<br/>
A typical card: "Something's Missing. Something that ought to be here isn't. It could be your sword, or a friend you were hoping to meet, or something else. Gain 1 Destiny to play this on yourself, or pay 2 Destiny to play on someone else."<br/>
<br/>
I tried added some suits and progressions to the cards, such that you could increase the reward value by chaining them, but it got too fiddly for the people I was playing with at that point. In general, the idea never really caught on with the group, and while I've been pecking at it for a while, I still haven't found a happy implementation.                        </div>

                            I read this idea and my brain went off in a slightly different direction.  Some of the key things I like about stories (tv/game/whatever) relate to these patterns or chains of character developments.  Firstly the emergence of the cycle, and the moment of recognition.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Oh god, Bob just sacrificed his own happiness to help someone else whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never know or appreciate it, and then gained inner strength and had his beliefs reinforced by it, that happened before when he was dealing with the thing with the gangsters and the baby!Ã¢â‚¬Â  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a cool moment.<br/>
<br/>
The next cool moment is when we see that BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to go into a similar cycle, and we can all look at each other and say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I just bet BobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to turn down the dream job to help Josie, and discover by doing so that he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been happy doing that anyway.Ã¢â‚¬Â  And we grin with shared appreciation for that chain weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created, identified, validated in play and now can anticipate.  ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very cool moment too.<br/>
<br/>
So IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be looking in the direction of design that fosters those moments.  I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think formalising the chains a priori would do that, but maybe thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another way of fostering it?  InSpectres kind of does something similar with confessionals, with a reward for one player taking up in play the suggested character behaviour of another player.  Could that maybe be extended further, with rewards for recognising patterns that have emerged from the behaviour of characters of other players, and rewards for validating the patterns of behaviour others have suggested.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to keep the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlook what coolness we made without realising itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ factor, because thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really fun, but facilitate it.  They may be tricky to reconcile.<br/>

                            That's kinda what I'm aiming for with Covenant's moments of truth, where resolving a conflict in a manner that highlight your beliefs gives you various options for character development.<br/><br/>A great example from a playtest is one guy with his guts hanging out and being chased by a rival. He has the truism "my friends will see me through". Another PC aided him in his escape attempt. He can choose to remove that wound only because his friend helped him out. Or conversely, because his friend didn't...<br/><br/>Getting back to chains. I think you could do something interesting with a circular cycle, where everytime you move through it you alter one item. So you start with:<br/><br/>"falls in love"+"gets rejected"+"heartbroken rage"+"gives up love"<br/><br/>But when you finish a section you change on element of that chain. Say to:<br/><br/>"falls in love"+"gets rejected"+"pursues love"+"gives up love"<br/><br/>You could also set it up so other players could change links at certain times. Or so that characters with a particular combination had to be involved in the same scene.                        </div>

                            Matt, slowly altering the core cycles is what I was originally getting at with the idea of "key chakras."  I like the idea that character behavior follows repetative patterns but that those patterns are constantly evolving.<br/><br/>Claire, I could definitely see that happening if someone would, say, stumble upon using the same link pattern without necessarily intending it.  Like:<br/><br/>"Hey, didn't you just do <i>Sacrifice My Happiness + Help Others + Reconsider What I Really Want</i>, again?  Didn't you do that with those gangsters, two sessions ago?

                            Anything that leads to mechanization fo language (which I think some of these ideas will really require) makes me happy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think it's an excellent idea, and one more reaosn to look at glass bead games for structure, but it also suggests some interesting ideas in terms of publication, writing, and presentation.<br/>
<br/>
First, - this makes for a very interesting tool that can be used in both closed and open GMing models.  Supposing there is a full on narrative web, you could use it in a game where all players have full visibility into the web, and can plan their development from square one as easily as  you could in a game where players are more in the dark (seeing only their section of the map) and will have much strong process of discovery.  In way of example, a specific sort of failure may lead to a new path.  In an open game, a player may plan for this, in a closed game, a player may discover this.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you think one approach is better than the other, what's remarkable is that this provides a concrete tool that could be used equally well from the same source material.<br/>
<br/>
Second - while still on the topic of writing stuff for other people, consider how this addresses a huge flaw of published adventures: they're not written for _your_ group.  It makes it very hard to hook players in without needing to do enough work to call into question why you bought the product in the first place.  Supposing that you had certain recognizable patterns, you could write an adventure to those patterns, creating sort of a translation layer to create immediate hook-ins.<br/>
<br/>
To illustrate, suppose you've got a game based off console RPGs, you isolate a few chakras/patterns/whatever.  The Silent Stranger, the Hero with a clouded past, the powerful innocent and so on.  When I write an adventure, i don't know what the specific hoosk of the characters in yoru group are, but I know what _patterns_ you use, so I can hook into those.<br/>
<br/>
Third - This sort of thing makes me want to see someone take the existing RPG design patterns and turn it up to 11. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  cool, chewy stuff, but I'd be insanely curious to see how different this looks in various people's heads.<br/>

Indeed. Something like: this is a scenario for one character with a "obsessed with revenge" link, one with "desperately in love" and so on. Then you plug 'em in and go.<br/><br/>I think you could do something coolly visual with your "link pool" and your "character sheet".  In fact the chains and links thing might work neatly in a card game form...                        </div>

<i>Then you can look at it and say "In any conflict, one side is going to lose (and grow) and the other side is going to get some resources for temporary dominance, but stay static." That works when the GM wins (characters grow) and when the players win (Situation grows) and even, I suspect, for PvP conflicts not involving the GM.</i><br/>
Tony, that was the exact idea behinf the clock. Unfortunatly I forgot to consider PvP. And yes Joshua, adversity is the word, not situation. I am trying to integrate it into the arc-idea. Brain still fussy.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile<br/>
<br/>
Look at the circumstances in Vincent Baker's DitV mod Afraid. Here you pick a circumstance and until you win a conflict where it is specifcally at stake the GM has to frame your character in a scene according to your character's circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
These chains could work like that.<br/>
<br/>
"falls in love"+"gets rejected"+"heartbroken rage"+"gives up love"<br/>
<br/>
This will be your character's cycle until you specifically state sie tries to break out of it. And the stage you are on, "fall in love"," get rejected" and so on, then have certain possible outlets.<br/>
<br/>
Each leaving your character with a different trait in the process. Both giving you the player character growth and then as Emily suggested opening up vunerablilties.<br/>
Falling Love - break out after this and your character gets the trait In Love - named NPC/PC. The GM then get the right to hit that NPC/PC with trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking out loud now, time to think quietly.                        </div>

                            If you're an <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> junkie like me and Shreyas (or even if you're not), you might want to check out the example arcs I posted here:<br/><br/><a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/05/avatar-development-arcs.html" rel="nofollow">Avatar Development Arcs</a><br/><br/>Additionally, all of this "patterns of story/character behavior" stuff, whether intentionally or not, draws on a lot of techniques from Russian structuralism, especially the pioneering work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Propp" rel="nofollow">Vladimir Propp</a> who spent many years analyzing fairy tales and breaking them down into patterns (think of him as the great-grandfather of <i>Once Upon a Time</i>).  So mad props to Vlad Propp.<br/><br/>Also, more props go out to Thomas Mann:<br/><br/>"We may be seeing a phenomenon which we would be tempted to describe as imitation or continuation, a notion of life in which each person's role is to revive certain given forms, certain mythical schema established by forbearers, and to allow them reincarnation."<br/><br/>Here's Mann explained by Milan Kundera:<br/><br/>"...we think we act, we think we think, but it is another or others who think and act in us: that is to say, timeless habits, archetypes, which - having become myths passed on from one generation to the next - carry an enormous seductive power and control us (says Mann) from 'the well of the past.' "<br/><br/>This is one of the key themes of Shreyas' <i>Torchbearer</i>, actually, and of <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/05/game-i-cant-write-yet.html" rel="nofollow">the game I'm not quite ready to write</a> (but this new development has brought me several steps closer).                        </div>

                            Okay, I completed a <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/05/basic-character-arc-mechanics.html" rel="nofollow">basic draft of some mechanics</a> for creating the kinds of "links &amp; chains" structure that some people were talking about here.  This version is completely open ended: you can create whatever links and chains you want.  It would be up to more specific implementations of this to decide if you wanted to reward folks for fulfilling or breaking certain fixed chain patterns (linear "lifepaths" or circular "chakras" or branching "webs" or whatever).  Obviously, there could be other implementations of this basic idea that could be very different.  This is just one basic set of mechanics to give us a solid example to talk about.  Shreyas seems to want to play some <i>Avatar</i>, so maybe we'll try it out this weekend.<br/><br/>It strikes me now that this is a lot like the "tagging" that's become so popular in organizing information nowadays.  In the system I describe, you can "tag" a given link (which is basically an instance of play) to be a part of all sorts of chains, creating a web of connections.  In online play, or if players wanted to keep a computerized record of the game, this could create some neat opportunities for narrative mapping.  It might even give us an inside peak into the narrative structure of roleplaying sessions and campaigns, which, as many smart folks have pointed out, can be rather different from some narrative forms like literature and film.  "Anti-story" folks, this could be a neat opportunity for you.                        </div>

                            I've included a mechanic for the development-comes-from-suffering idea in my Agonistes game system. I call it "dark fortune cookies" and "light fortune cookies". If you roleplay a flaw in your character, this earns you a dark fortune cookie, and you can spend this by making something bad happen to your character. This can be an opportunity for character development (character learns the lesson), or the character can respond with a flaw again and earn another dark fortune cookie. Light fortune cookies are the opposite, rewards for roleplaying a character strength, and you can use them to save your butt by introducing a "lucky coincidence". The underlying idea is "fortune rewards those who act in accordance with their nature." Kind of a karma thing.<br/>
This idea of the development taking the form of arcs, though - I like that a lot. Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Jonathan, you may like my short novel City of Masks given what you say about the game you can't write yet. It's on my website (http://www.csidemedia.com) in PDF. Basic idea, there's a city where the conventions of masking apply all the time, and you have to treat everyone as if their mask was their true identity or face civil, religious and social penalties. A Holy Fool blunders in and upsets various applecarts.                        </div>

                            Hmmm. Circular "escalation paths" on the character sheet? For, say, Joy, Anger, Fear, Depression, Desire? As you go round and round the escalation path you pick up tokens. When the tokens reach a trigger level (based on other aspects of the character such as Patience), you exit from the escalation path in some direction (determined by where you are? What the current situation is? Something). Tokens exchangable to some degree (Joy can reduce the negs, but only a certain amount?) Depending what happens on the exit from the path, you can be bounced back into it with more or fewer tokens, or escape permanently?<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking about Harry Potter here as an example. Harry gets angrier and angrier, lashes out at his friends over minor issues (exit from the path), depending on their reaction/other things going on he either continues to escalate or drops back to a lower level - but the anger is always there under the surface. I like the idea of a ruling passion driving someone in circles which they can escape from but only under unusual circumstances.                        </div>
