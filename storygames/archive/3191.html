It was Buffalo Run (which you can find <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15655.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>). <br/><br/>Towards the end of the game, two of the Dogs decided that the Mountain Men had to pay for killing one of the townspeople and had raised a posse. The other Dog had a trait, "opposed to mindless violence" and stood against them. They had a conflict to see if they would attack the Mountain Men. He managed to stay with them but ran short of dice and did not want to escalate to guns and so gave.<br/><br/>This was this guy's first experience of Dogs and to me it was obvious that he had a lot emotionally invested in the outcome of this conflict and did not want to give. I'm attempting to get in touch with him so I can find out exactly what he thought about it but in the meantime, I wondered to what extent players generally care about their Dogs as opposed to caring about the story. <br/><br/>Personally I want interesting things to happen but am not quite so bothered as to whether my Dog survives, as long as (s)he lives in interesting times. I didn't want to interrupt the game to discuss this issue because I thought it probably would have spoilt the mood - it did make for very engaged gaming all round.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72774/#Comment_72774" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T17:29:15+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  5:29PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My stock answer is that I don't care, I'm happy for interesting things to happen. Often, I quite like to die, because it's dramatic.<br/><br/>Having said that, I've been known to get ridiculously invested in conflicts. Like in Paranoia last Thursday. I had to take a couple of breaths and remind myself it was only a game and <i>I</i> wasn't going to get demoted to Infrared.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72777/#Comment_72777" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T17:46:58+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  5:46PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I care deeply about my Dog, and weep for the horrible tragedies that I <i>deliberately steer them into</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I wouldn't make their lives half so miserable if I didn't care about them so much.

I had a player that obviously didn't care if his character lived or died and often would rather he perished.  We came up with really fantastic stakes that the player was VERY interested in protecting - this basically questioned whether it would be his character that got screwed or an important connection of his.  <i>Maybe this is something I should talk about in an AP, as I think about it.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
