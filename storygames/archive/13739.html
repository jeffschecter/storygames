The characters were deciding whether to destroy a planet. I was the governor of the planet.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, here is what happened:\n<ul><li>I was stripped of my position as governor</li>\n<li>I was shot and died</li>\n<li>My planet was destroyed</li>\n<li>I was embraced by the dark chaos gods, whom I'd served throughout the game</li>\n</ul>\nWhat was remarkable was: this felt like a win to me.<br/><br/>Win conditions, in LARPs, fascinate me: I'm mainly talking, here, about LARPs where everyone has written objectives. Often, they are a zero sum game: if I succeed in my objective of Summon The Dark Gods, you fail in your objective of Save The World. Thus, someone has to lose.<br/><br/>But this didn't happen here. I failed in all but one of my objectives. However, that one objective made me feel good about the game. Probably, I'd have felt equally good if I'd survived, been stripped of my position but saved the planet.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this was partly down to clever GMing. When I was killed, the GM didn't merely let me be shot. She let me have a final moment, in which I summoned some dark power to destroy my assassin. Then she narrated a quick epilogue, in which I was embraced by the dark gods. It felt like a fitting ending.<br/><br/>But it wasn't just that. The objectives were carefully structured so that, however they turned out, I could convince myself I'd won. If I failed in one objective, I was likely to succeed in another. (Indeed, one of my objectives required destroying the planet, while another required saving it.)<br/><br/>So, somewhere in there, there were clever win conditions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
