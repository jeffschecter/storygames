It's also playable as a stand-alone wargame, with the option to zoom in and resolve individual character-to-character duels, or heroic forays in which characters personally lead attacks on massed troops. The emphasis on the role of commanders, and the way the rules are extrapolated from the roleplaying scale, mean that it's easy to determine how these individual actions affect the course of the battle at large. In my experience, this creates greater identification with "my guy" as the commander of units when playing it as a wargame and engages the visualization gears in a way I'm trained to do when playing a RPG but don't always bring to a boardgame.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
