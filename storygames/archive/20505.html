I got invited to a G+ group of designers some time ago, but I never got accustomed to using it, nor found there enough discussions or material of the kind I enjoy, to keep going there. Posting mine among so few people with different tastes than mine made me feel bad, so I kinda let it die. Also, I don't think I've ever received more notifications from that group.<br/><br/>Forums are up to the date still the best tool for the kind of discussion I enjoyl, though I haven't seen but only one or two more like SG and I'm not even sure they are active anymore. Also, it's kinda tiresome to lurk again in forums I don't know until I get what they are taking about and have enough input to participate.

For example, the Finnish indie game design community has generally been detached from the American one after last decade's close ties now that the public fora have lost in relevance. The result has been positive for the smaller local community overall, I feel, as there's more mindspace available for independent thought and doing your own thing without merely reflecting the glory of the global leaders. Also, the people with the chops for doing international level work are more likely to stick to the local circles when there's nothing like e.g. the Forge attracting them, which further improves the quality of the local culture of play and design.<br/><br/>I might estimate that if the consequences of the shift have been similar in e.g. half a dozen national/local rpg scenes of similar scope, then we're basically producing as much if not more of thoughtful, progressive rpg design work as the Forge community ever did. It's just that we don't know about what the others are doing because of, well, the non-existence of a shared international community. Perhaps there is some duplication of effort, but I think that the massive avoidance of groupthink probably off-sets that; I would be highly surprised if the local innovations, lessons and design trends over the last five years in your local community, wherever that is, were the same ones we have here. We don't even play Apocalypse World around here, practically speaking <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>So I guess my answer to Paul's question is that while he's probably right about the newcomer being out of luck in terms of grasping the rpg world in their finger-tips via a highly visible international community, the upside is that the local culture may today be much more competent to actually act as a legit background for your hobby and work, even with the big-Internet opportunities diminishing. That is, of course, if you happen to come from a non-insular local community that's actually been capable of improving and amassing the cultural capital to remain competitive.<br/><br/>A random idea related to this: it might be an interesting thread if we asked some people active in the diaspora to come in and report on the recent developments in their own corner of the rpg scene. This could be about some web platform that not everybody is reading, like G+, or a nation thing like the Finnish scene largely is, or whatever. Could be interesting, particularly if somebody's invented that philosopher's stone I've been looking for while I wasn't paying attention. Being as how e.g. I practically only follow the Finnish developments these days, all your excellent stones are being lost on me up there in the clouds or wherever it is that the kids keep their facebooks nowadays.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450673/#Comment_450673" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-15T23:19:15+00:00" title="January 15, 2016 11:19PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2016 11:19PM by catty_big.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I managed to find a nice RPG design community in fb</blockquote>\nWhere's that?

I mean, you can bump into people on RPGnet who reject 1990s RPG assumptions without even hunting for them.<br/><br/>RPG theory is a weird beast.  On one end, there's general "question assumptions" and "think about the real people" type stuff, which I think is generally circulating out there.  On the other end, there are specific details of how specific types of games work, which are harder to find but also relevant to many fewer people.  So if you'd benefit most from chatting about how to give your premise-supporting conflict escalation mechanics social and mechanical traction, then yeah, if you don't know the right people, that sucks for you; but if you'd benefit most from knowing that not every RPG needs hit points and levels, then the general RPG chat world has you covered.<br/><br/>Maybe.  Just a theory.<br/><br/><b>Re: "like-minded":</b><br/><br/>I no longer consider "vaguely Forge-like" to be meaningfully "like-minded", not the way I did when the only RPGs I knew carried the same set of '90s assumptions.  What I look for now is narrower, and thus harder to find.  <br/><br/>If I had the energy, I'd probably launch communities (FB? G+? Forums?  I dunno) dedicated to my interests, and then do what I could to recruit people who shared those interests until we had critical mass for reliable conversation.  That sounds like a lot of work, though, so for now I try to express my interests as best I can in my Story Games thread titles and hope that people who share my interests see them.  <br/><br/>If I could stand to be active enough on G+ to start popping up in people's feeds regularly, I'd do that, but I can't.  My online brain still moves at the pace of email.  For anyone who can keep up the pace, though, I suspect that Circling a few people who make games you like and are active on G+ and then contributing to their discussions and Circling others who do likewise might get you some audience for your own posts.  Maybe?  I'd be curious to know what Jason's observed on that front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450684/#Comment_450684" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-17T01:41:09+00:00" title="January 17, 2016  1:41AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2016 1:46AM by catty_big.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For anyone who can keep up the pace, though, I suspect that Circling a few people who make games you like and are active on G+ and then contributing to their discussions and Circling others who do likewise might get you some audience for your own posts.</blockquote>\nThis has definitely worked for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450685/#Comment_450685" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-17T02:29:15+00:00" title="January 17, 2016  2:29AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2016 2:30AM by AsIf.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, me too.

The discussions are searchable, persistent, and public.<br/><br/>With social media, it's generally impossible to find anything (and people generally like to make the most controversial or interesting discussions private, if possible), and only the most "current" topics are even available - and even that, for a short time.<br/><br/>My experience is that blog posts are the only way these days of sharing "persistent" information with people outside one's social circle. Is that correct?<br/><br/>Like David, I enjoy being involved in online discussions, but social media discussions move so quickly that I can't meaningfully keep up.

That is, of course, if you happen to come from a non-insular local community that's actually been capable of improving and amassing the cultural capital to remain competitive.</blockquote>\nI hope you are right, Eero!<br/><br/>I have not seen that, myself, in my (fairly small) circles. The people I used to have regular discussions with on central fora are now more likely to simply play games with their friends and occasionally publish completed designs. In order to have conversations with them I now have to contact them individually.

Still, I really liked the kind of archived discussions I saw on the Forge, and the ones going on here when it was more active. The story-games G+ community hasn't really taken off from what I can see (nor do I like the G+ format). <br/><br/>I find it harder now to stumble upon these discussions on G+ (for example), even though I'm following a bunch of the people whose games I enjoyed or whose posts I liked in said forums. I get the impression that a few of those folks aren't too interested in discussing game design. Perhaps they've moved on, or I'm not in the right G+ circles. <br/><br/>On the plus side, G+ allowed me to create a solo gaming community which has gotten bigger than I ever dreamed of (even if tiny compared to other groups). I've even seen a few folks come by who I think were active in the indie scene, which has been good because I'm seeing more ideas that break the trend set by Mythic. I like that diversity of thought.<br/><br/>Of course, I can't claim that it was because of the existence of the G+ group, but I'm glad it's gotten on their radar in such a way that they have decided to share their ideas there as well.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450916/#Comment_450916" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-26T20:51:52+00:00" title="January 26, 2016  8:51PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday I decided to search the groups at GoodReads.com for discussions on RPG books, and I found nothing but fic-chat.

This touches on issues of not only "community" and marketing (obvs), but also literary merit and authorial intent.

Guess what? Pointing out that posts on a fora someone called 'pretty international' are in <i>one</i> language does not require a 'privilege check'. And even the comeback for that perceived slight was clever and amusing enough to let slide. Seriously, this is exactly the kind of misunderstanding between people who don't share enough context <i>and</i> read in bad faith that keeps people from reaching out.<br/><br/>Internet culture has become toxically political and overly literal as of late, which boggles me for a medium built on symbols and interpretations. Where you post and who you associate with carries more weight than what you have to say, and many have a disproportionate idea of just how much an impact game design has on social change (or that it should be used for such in the first place). The major 'social' platforms cannot be searched effectively or used for nuanced discussions, which makes it less likely for meaningful ideas to find genesis, and more likely for harmful misunderstandings to occur. Context has become nonexistent, or rather only one context is ever considered, and bad faith readings are the norm. And game systems (which even include Fate and Apocalypse World) are being used to aggressively establish tribal affiliations as opposed to further design. It's no longer about discussing ideas, but enforcing tribal boundaries.<br/><br/>And those Facebook pages had nothing in the way of legitimate design discussion. The RPG Design Network was especially bad, consisting of nothing but ads, or worse, ads framed as design discussions. The closest they got were inquires such as 'd6's or d8's?', and a poll on which existing systems track damage 'best'. In addition they require you to post at least once a month to 'keep the list active'. If that's not a commercially driven directive that will lead to posts of no substance, I don't know what will.<br/><br/>The sad truth is that most people are <i>not worth listening to</i> and <i>not willing to listen</i> when it comes to, well, <i>most</i> things. Even I may not be worth listening to, but I still <i>listen</i>, and I'm going to seek out designers who have a culture of communication and understand how mechanics influence human behavior, (regrettably) not complete unknowns, or folks who keep reinventing the same damn game over and over again (usually because they've never bothered to read or play anything beyond some form of D&amp;D).<br/><br/>Honestly, this is about the last forum on the internet where any meaningful <i>tabletop</i> RPG design discussion takes place. Beyond this I'll just have to engage with the designers whose insight matters to me directly. And while they're not exactly inaccessible in their virtual ivory towers, the current medium still revolves around the designer and not the ideas being discussed.<br/><br/>And I think that's where most of us are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450982/#Comment_450982" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-29T22:38:51+00:00" title="January 29, 2016 10:38PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>I've been on G+ for years, but it took a long time to find and connect.

The real problem isn't aggression or that these are bad questions to ask, it's that they were completely out of place in that particular thread.

I can't <i>make</i> someone else care about something just because it seems important to <i>me</i>.  So I kinda have to just wait until the right confluence of my interests and others' arises.
