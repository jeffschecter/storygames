I'm going call it Inertia for now and do my best to explain it in a rambly post.</i><br/><br/>So we've started playing a game, lets imagine that our story is a boulder. <br/><br/>In Microscope, and Shock (two games I love) the boulder is at rest. In fact, it is sitting at the base of a hill and we're going to work together to roll it at the top.<br/><br/>In Fiasco or Apocalypse World (also awesome). The boulder is already at the top of a hill. The setting the seed material, playbooks, playsets, all get us there.<br/><br/>Some games ask us to do a lot of heavy lifting at the start. Other games do that for us and just ask us to make little decisions. <br/><br/>I'm also interested in the impact of game design on the inertia of the story during play. Sometimes designs bring the story to a screeching halt, or ask the players to dig deep and make up something really big. <br/><br/>Look what happens when you roll a hit on GO AGGRO in apocalypse world...<br/><i>On a 10+, they have to choose: force your hand and suck it up, or cave and do what you want. </i><br/>That move pretty much shoves the story right back in your face. As a player it dosen't take much effort to figure out what happens next. <br/><br/>Compare that to another move that totally defines apocalypse world for me... OPEN YOUR BRAIN<br/><i>On a hit, the MC will tell you something new and interesting about the current situation, and might ask you a question or two; answer them...</i><br/>OYB stops everything right in its tracks the first time it comes up. "What is the psychic maelstrom like for you?" "What do you see?" We've all got to dig deep and bring it. Later on, after we know that already The Quarentine sees the dead people he's killed, it is not so hard to figure out what to do.<br/><br/>Microscope hast his feature where after all that heavy lifting at the beginning when it is your turn you get to decide how hard you want to work. Interestingly it is easiest to make huge decisions (Periods and Events) and hardest to decide small things (Scenes).<br/><br/><b>So...</b><br/>Sometimes I'm playing a game and we're blazing along, other-times it is a total Slug race. Some games scream "PLAY ME!" others I know I'm gonna love but I'm going to have to work my self up to. <br/><br/>When I try and figure out why that is, I keep coming back to this idea of Narrative Inertia. The games I play over and over are the ones that sucker me in with a quick start, but also make me really work from time to time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379679/#Comment_379679" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T14:46:26+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  2:46PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know I've experienced disappointment in games that expect you to bring the enthusiasm from outside rather than generating them dynamically (my one experience with Shock: was really lackluster because none of us were really excited about the SF we were basing the session around, we expected the excitement to "kick in" through the process of playing like it does for some other games). I don't know if it's exactly the same thing, but to me it sounds like you might be talking about the difference between in-the-moment intuitive creativity and intentional, whole-cloth authorship. From an objective POV they both count as "creating" something, but they subjectively feel very different. There's a difference between saying "ooh, let's have a scene where my pseudo-Mormon cowboy threatens that farmer with a gun!" and starting a scene and letting it develop organically to the point where pulling out a gun feels appropriate. I relate this back to some ideas from cognitive science and psychology where unconscious associative thinking feels more like recognition, perception, or memory while conscious logical thought feels effortful. I've tried my hand at writing fiction, and while it's satisfying in a "hard day's work" kind of way, it's not intrinsically enjoyable to me, so it's not something I usually like to see in gaming. I much prefer it when games arrange their mechanics/procedures/seed-content/etc. so that my creative contributions are prompted obliquely, feeling more like perception or recognition than raw whole-cloth authorship (for example: "Oh, that just happened? Well in that situation my character would obviously _____", where the blank may not be obvious to anyone who isn't inside my brain). When games don't do enough to hook into my psychology I usually experience it as "blank page syndrome" and usually end up getting emotionally disengaged from the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379688/#Comment_379688" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T16:28:23+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  4:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although vague, as you admit, this is an important study of an emotional issue in games.<br/><br/>I'm tempted to say "it's up to your environment" but that sounds like "as long as you've got a good GM..." and doesn't really solve anything.<br/><br/>I'm thinking the term "Narrative Inertia" is really useful, however. If we can rate games with higher Narrative Inertia (ones that help get the story going quicker, I'm assuming) as opposed to those with lower NI, then we have a quick way of selecting games that match the mood of a given evening.<br/><br/>At a con, for instance, you probably want to present games with higher Narrative Inertia. The less players have to do to get the ball rolling there, the bigger response you're likely to get. However, such games sometimes feel like "one-offs" or novelties, where players aren't neccessarily interested in returning to the table. I enjoy games such as Fiasco, Zombie Cinema and Ghost/Echo which are easy to set up and easy to sell players on if you have to move fast.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a much more delicate touch and dedicated group is needed for, say Burning Wheel or even a relatively new but rules light system like Final Hours of a Storied Age. These players are being asked to put a lot of themselves into a game - they must devote their imaginative energies and cooperative skills to the system or the system is not going to work. Also, if you get silly with games like that (or Microscope or Shock) it feels like more of a betrayal than the looser playing style you can get away with in games with more inertia. <br/><br/>On the other hand, you have a far richer experience in these high-investment games. The extra work you put into them pays off. They are, however, super intimidating and even headache inducing for some new gamers and for casual gamers (using Robin Law's definition) in particular. It takes a very delicate hand (and hand I confess I sometimes do not have) to interest such players in a low-inertia game. If you can, though, they like them more.<br/><br/>Games like Prime Time Adventures, IAWA and InSpectres fall in the middle, I'd guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Bruce" title="Robert Bruce"><img alt="Robert Bruce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Bruce">Robert Bruce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379692/#Comment_379692" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T16:35:17+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  4:35PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think in Fiasco and Apocalypse World there's more agreement at the beginning about what kind of story you're going to tell together.  Cohen Bros/Mad Max-ish.  In Microscope and Shock, you create things and those things push you towards the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe speed with and extent to which you can establish a kind of dynamically generated verisimilitude seems to be important in evaluating narrative inertia.  I mean by "dynamically generated verisimilitude" an aesthetic sense about what rings true to the story that is created while playing the game.  When everyone starts building off of each other and in response to what other people are saying you are thinking (or saying!)

With a stable situation, you first have to put in the energy to destabilize it.

It *is* work to set up a campaign (or scenario), but once things get moving, the fiction tends to flow quite smoothly. The main headache most players have playing BW is, of course, with the mechanical subsystems.<br/><br/>If the fiction *isn't* flowing naturally and smoothly, then it's likely the players have badly-written Beliefs, and/or the GM isn't aware of those Beliefs. But then that gets back to setup\u2014something you very much *aren't* supposed to be doing while playing.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379744/#Comment_379744" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T08:54:18+00:00" title="May 25, 2012  8:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, that brings up a good point that NI can feel differently for different players.

Curious thing, that the more one particular player moves that boulder, the more investment that player does in the fiction and the more easy to grow attached to that role. And the more other players obstruct the path, move the boulder in another direction or stop it in it's tracks, the more that role will feel like actual work for the player(s) who have invested more in adding it momentum. So, Procedures would be the plan everybody should agree to move the boulder in the most efficient way, which would be different for every group and genre of the game... hmmm interesting concept!<br/><br/>Allow me to keep the analogy rolling: <br/><br/>-A pre-made setting that already offers possibilities for unbalanced situations is like starting on a hillside terrain. You can choose where to place the boulder, but you have to do it carefully and make it a big enough boulder. <br/>Railroading then can be nice and simple if all the players perceive is the boulder rolling down and not the GM moving it.<br/><br/>-Correct me if I'm wrong but Fiasco with the pre-made scenario and procedures would be like a stepper hillside, where players have enough spotlight fo push or pull the boulder, but not enough to stop it or giving it a terminal direction. Players invest but don't hoard the boulder.<br/><br/>-Then BW would be like a plain terrain, where the procedures help players build a big boulder by pushing it in a direction agreed by all players. Of course, once it gains momentum, it's unstoppable.<br/><br/>-And Microscope would be like a...time travelling teleporting boulder?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379756/#Comment_379756" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T11:06:24+00:00" title="May 25, 2012 11:06AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [I'm enjoying the discussion.

Some games give you pre-assembled narrative material.</b><br/>In <i>Lady Blackbird</i> you always start with the same characters in the same situation. In <i>Lacuna</i>, your characters always have the same job. In <i>Mouse Guard</i> you are always guards. Etc.<br/><br/><b>2. Some games give you raw narrative material that you assemble.</b><br/>Playbooks in <i>Apocalypse World</i> (i.e. you assemble the party), lifepaths in <i>Burning Wheel</i>, playsets in <i>Fiasco</i>, oracles <i>In a Wicked Age</i>. You don't tend to use all of the material at once, so it's different each time you play. But once you assemble stuff, you have some material that pushes you towards a story.<br/><br/><b>3. Some games give you instructions for generating narrative material.</b><br/><i>Microscope</i> and <i>Shock:</i>, obviously. Beliefs and Instincts in <i>Burning Wheel</i>. You still have to come up with the actual material, but it's part of the procedures to think something up and then do something with it.<br/><br/><b>4. Some games assume you've already got narrative material and just give you rules.</b><br/>So, basically most games? The <i>GURPS Basic Set</i> would be the best example, because there's not even setting material, just rules.<br/><br/>I would draw a line between setting material that doesn't include links to the players' characters, and situations that can actually be used to start a game session (that stuff is part of #1). For example, <i>Rifts</i> and <i>Talislanta</i> include tons of setting material, but also tend to assume the GM is going to provide the adventure.

I recorded a series of playtests, 3 in three days. When I went back and listened to them it was really obvious when things were rolling. You could actualy see it in the waveform. people are laughing, talking excitedly, and then BAM they would hit this mechanic and everything ground to a halt. It was the same mechanic each time too, so I ended up taking the damn thing out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379791/#Comment_379791" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-25T22:07:55+00:00" title="May 25, 2012 10:07PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know...I mean, I can come and play a decent game of GURPS without bringing a ton of stuff to the table, so long as I'm not the GM.

Who provides the energy is another dimension. And of course, if you're playing more or less railroaded scenarios where the GM acts and the players react, but the GM never reacts to what the players are doing, the GM will have to input more energy continuously. The free-flowing state seems to me to happen when there's enough interesting things happening that people just have to react to the reactions of others, meaning very little new energy has to be put into the system. Sometimes a thread gets wrapped up, and if you're playing a longer game and want to keep going, you'll probably have to put in some effort to add a new thread, but that's a little energy, sometimes, and it's pretty easy to provide.<br/><br/>So that's another way of thinking about it, I guess? How much is making up new things and how much is reacting to things already there. Reacting is effortless, but making stuff up takes more effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379805/#Comment_379805" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T04:30:16+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  4:30AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Yeah, I feel like the concept of Narrative Inertia has been pretty much nailed here.</p>\n<p>I love improvising narratives - I like how they surprise me as GM, and when you create a twist or neat reincorporation, or (even better) when one of your players does, you will often laugh for joy.

The players will, I suspect, often invest more in things they create themselves and spend a lot of time building up (either as play or prep). I'm fond of games that contain rules to build up a situation. It makes it require a lot less effort, but still builds investment. Sort of like the prepwork in fiasco or IaWA. It's a middle ground between Blackbird and Burning Wheel. Above all, it works great for one-shots. If you're playing a campaign, I can see spending the time playing out all of that buildup and establishing and introducing stuff and relationships through play as building a lot of great investment. What I'd love to see is a game that helps you do that, sort of like the situation building rules, but through play. Maybe Apocalypse World does this? I haven't read it and I've only played it in one shots; it doesn't work at all for me, but other people have said things that make me suspect there's some of this in that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379807/#Comment_379807" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T05:40:00+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  5:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The problem with that is, as has been mentioned, investment.

Some games give you pre-assembled narrative material.</b><br/>In<i>Lady Blackbird</i>you always start with the same characters in the same situation. In<i>Lacuna</i>, your characters always have the same job. In<i>Mouse Guard</i>you are always guards. Etc.<br/><br/><b>2. Some games give you raw narrative material that you assemble.</b><br/>Playbooks in<i>Apocalypse World</i>(i.e. you assemble the party), lifepaths in<i>Burning Wheel</i>, playsets in<i>Fiasco</i>, oracles<i>In a Wicked Age</i>. You don't tend to use all of the material at once, so it's different each time you play. But once you assemble stuff, you have some material that pushes you towards a story.<br/><br/><b>3. Some games give you instructions for generating narrative material.</b><br/><i>Microscope</i>and<i>Shock:</i>, obviously. Beliefs and Instincts in<i>Burning Wheel</i>. You still have to come up with the actual material, but it's part of the procedures to think something up and then do something with it.<br/><br/><b>4. Some games assume you've already got narrative material and just give you rules.</b><br/>So, basically most games? The<i>GURPS Basic Set</i>would be the best example, because there's not even setting material, just rules.<br/><br/>I would draw a line between setting material that doesn't include links to the players' characters, and situations that can actually be used to start a game session (that stuff is part of #1). For example,<i>Rifts</i>and<i>Talislanta</i>include tons of setting material, but also tend to assume the GM is going to provide the adventure. Adventure modules usually provide the pre-assembled narrative material, or the GM writes it, and it's usually not part of the game outside of PCs being "adventurers" or whatever.<br/><br/>So, using the boulder metaphor, in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> it's on the edge of a cliff, about to fall off.

But I'd argue that Burning Wheel and, especially, Burning Empires go on level 2 (world creation is largely from a list in Burning Empires although players get to tweak the details.) I should point out also that I dislike creating new terms where simpler ones will do, but the categorical academic in me is difficult to suppress.<br/><br/>Also, I think a sliding scale like this is useful in judging what kind of games to spring on what kind of group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379857/#Comment_379857" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T11:24:34+00:00" title="May 27, 2012 11:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone's scale is a useful way to think about the way a game starts, it also goes beyond that. <br/>You can also look at an individual mechanic and say things like, "What impact does that have on the Narrative Inertia?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379867/#Comment_379867" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T16:20:03+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  4:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>If we can rate games with higher Narrative Inertia (ones that help get the story going quicker, I'm assuming)</blockquote>\nI'd use the term in the reverse sense, which just goes to show. Inert substances are ones that don't react. Inertia is the property of objects that resists acceleration.<br/><br/>Sure, in physics objects with large inertia are difficult to stop or steer once they have started, as well as being difficult to get moving in the first place, but I don't think that's the quality that we're talking about here, and if it were I'd suggest "momentum" rather than "inertia".<br/><br/>Outside of physics, where inertia is connected to momentum through Newton's First and Second Laws and means "resistance to acceleration", inertia is defined as "lack of effort, motion, action and the like, inactivity, sluggishness".  So a person meeting the phrase "narrative inertia" un-primed with jargon will assume that it means sluggishness or lack of action in the story, perhaps resistance to a rapid increase of pace. Not an easy rapid start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379873/#Comment_379873" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T17:25:06+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  5:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I have a weird relationship with this idea. I think something like it is really important to my play, but a lot of the examples in this thread don't make sense to me. So, important caveat: I may be talking about something different than all of you are talking about.<br/><br/>In particular, Lady Blackbird strikes me as very difficult on this front. There's no obvious way to get started. Yeah, you have an opening location, and some characters, but you don't know anything else. You don't know what the genre of the story is, you don't know much about what the world is like, you don't know much about your characters' personalities. You know you have to get out of the cell, but you don't know how hard that will be, or what ways to do that are plausible/cool. Once you make something up about how you get out, you don't know what your next move should be, other than boring logistical stuff like getting fuel.<br/><br/>Presumably the exception is the keys, but I find them hard to actually use. My character has a crush on Lady Blackbird. Ok... but why? How much chance does he have? What has their relationship been like up to this point? How does he flirt anyway? There are tons of stuff that you have to figure out before you can even begin to try to hit your key.<br/><br/>Compare this to Fiasco. The first thing you do is pick a playset, which is super easy. Either one sounds cool, or you pick one at random, and either way will work fine. Then you roll some dice, and look through this evocative list of elements. One probably stands out, and if not, you'll still be fine picking at random. As you pick elements, you start to get some patterns and ideas, and some elements seem obviously better than others. By the time you start actually narrating stuff, you have twelve different ideas about how this could all go horribly wrong.<br/><br/>I think the difference is that Fiasco walks you through the opening stages, so that every step feels small and easy. Lady Blackbird dumps you into a world you don't yet care about, with characters you don't yet know, and you have to make a running leap to get things moving. Maybe that's a subtly different thing than you guys are talking about, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379875/#Comment_379875" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T17:54:19+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  5:54PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter, I think that's a good point, and speaks to Ross's criticism of my four categories as only addressing the initial start of a game. Because Lady Blackbird gives you pre-generated narrative material up-front, but nothing to keep you going throughout play.<br/><br/>So here's me expanding the theory, Ross. I think you can look at in-play procedures and rules and use those same four categories in a similar fashion, mostly changing <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>. Then you have:<br/><br/>1. A statement that dictates exactly what happens next.<br/><br/>2. A statement that gives someone a choice of what happens next.<br/><br/>3. A statement that tells you how to decide what happens next.<br/><br/>4. A statement that presents you with setting material, but no narrative material.<br/><br/>There's also a difference between what happens next procedurally, and what happens next in the fiction.<br/><br/>So like, when it is your turn in Microscope, that's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> a statement saying exactly this happens next, but procedurally: Ross makes up a thing. The rules that tell you how to make up a thing in Microscope are <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> statements that tell you how to decide what happens next, but they are procedural, not narrative. When you put down the event "Rosstown is founded," that is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> a statement that dictates exactly what happens next in the narrative.<br/><br/>Pass/fail mechanics are generally narrative <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, whether you succeed or not determines how the GM narrates the subsequent fiction. If you go aggro, it's (almost) always a narrative <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. If you miss, the GM picks off a list of moves. If you get 7-9, the other player picks off a much shorter list, and if you get a 10+ the other player either picks off a list of two, or if that list is "suffer harm or suffer harm," then hey, it becomes <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>Lots of times, the amount of procedural stuff will slow down play. Like, you mention the difference between setting up a period or an event versus a scene in Microscope. There is very little procedure before you get to narrative/fiction with a period or event. But with a scene, you have to decide which characters are in it, who plays them, and what question they are supposed to answer in the scene. But that tends to result in more narrative, right? Playing the scene takes longer than explaining "Rosstown is founded."<br/><br/>So, if that extra procedural stuff at the beginning pays off in the end, you have <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> type rules translated into both setting and statements that dictate what happen next. Also like you mentioned, the first time you open your brain, the MC has to ask what that is like. But after that, you have a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> statement in effect. When that character opens their brain, what was previously described is what it's like. And more than likely, players become more invested in stuff they made up themselves that gets re-incorporated. So, basically, if you are doing longer-term stuff, you want procedures that tell you how to make stuff up and then how to use what you made up later on, and in shorter-term stuff, you want a bunch of narrative material that you can work with right away as long as everybody likes it right off the bat. If you have to go through a lot of procedures only to end up with no narrative material at the end, it's usually a bummer. Roll to hit, roll for damage, roll for armour, roll for luck stat, compare them all on charts and tables, and then nothing much happens? It's a rare breed of tactical gamer who finds that engaging. Most people get bored.<br/><br/>The change for <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> is that in play, all the rules do something, either 1, 2, or 3, after you put narrative material into them. But there is still setting stuff. Like when the players look at the hastily-scrawled map and say "Let's go to the Barrowlands!" and the GM is like "I have no idea what is there!" You don't know what happens next because do they get there? How? And how do you decide? The statement of travelling gives you nothing except a request for setting info.<br/><br/>Anyway, wow, that might be more rambly than your OP.

If you're given a piece of paper and asked to draw a picture, that's much harder than if someone gave you the same piece of paper and asked you to draw [a woman] (for example). I guess going in the other direction is like someone asking you to copy the Mona Lisa, or something.<br/><br/>Strangely enough my experience is that the too-little-structure effect is way bigger than the too-much-structure effect. I'm much more likely to be stumped by, say, Archipelago, than Lady Blackbird. I guess that might be because I grew up on fixed scenarios so I kind of know how they work. (This reminds me of the other thread about Lady Blackbird and tags and stuff.) Indeed, someone else was saying Lady Blackbird makes life really hard whereas Fiasco makes it easy - my experience has been the opposite. Not that I can't get into Fiasco, but I find I need to throw myself almost bodily at the other players sometimes to get some action going. Maybe I just know some relatively reactive roleplayers, I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381798/#Comment_381798" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T22:41:50+00:00" title="June 10, 2012 10:41PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what you're talking about are creative parameters.
