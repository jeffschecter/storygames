I wanted to try something similar to generate monster encounters . . . Well, for the particular of a smart enemy with human senses, the list of triggers would be somewhat short . . . Next the list of responses would do the same. For that you may better list more specific reactions based on the weapons and number of opponents . . . when players face a problem, complications become worse . . . I do give [Prepare, Hide, Analyze, and Attack] as suggestions to players when they look like they don't have a clue about what to do . . . whenever players want to try something difficult, they roll 2d6 . . . I also inform the players on how much time they have until they have to face another consequence . . . Interesting! I'd really like to see a formalization of that as a GM rule. I'm used to trad systems that ask for this "perception roll" . . . isn't this a usual way to play everywhere?</blockquote>I want to talk about all of these things!  Let's start a new thread.<br/><br/>Hmm, what's the topic, though?  "Immersionist GM practices"?</blockquote>\nOk, again it tuns out GM and roleplaying isn't exactly the same everywhere, even when we all use the same systems and familiar phrases. I give that every group is different, but giving your group some tools to make things like immersion easier isn't too difficult and definitely worth the try. Here's some of my tricks:<br/><br/>Prep:<br/>-Get pictures of characters, places and items. Describing is good, showing helps a lot; doing both is better.<br/>-While I impro a lot, nothing beats preparing events. Though I prep those only to the point where PCs can change something, after that, if players do nothing, the NPC's goals/motivations or current emotional state dictate my courso of action.<br/>-Before the game, talk with the players what's actually the game about. Even if for all your group, D&amp;D has always been about min-maxing, kicking doors, killing everything and looting it, you all have to agree on how lethal will the game be, how close to RAW are you going to play, if you would disregard rules for real-world physics and logic or setting-wise physics and logic, what kind of reference material is more close to what you want to play, etc. The more you argree on before the game, the less you will break immersion during the game.<br/><br/>In-game:<br/>-I describe until I feel I've said enough about the disposition of the place, things and people that the PCs can see and hear, the mood of the place and highlighted anything that I think might lead the players to a reaction. No threats, no rolls. Players may interrupt me to correct me if there's something I'm forgetting in my description, ask me to repeat myself or better yet, ask for further information about anything.<br/><br/>If that requires the PC to approach and/or interact with anything, I inform the player before describing his character doing so, as well as anything that could represent an inmediate threat. Some may say it's fair, some say I'm making things too easy for players. Some people only clarify when players do "the right questions". Fine, that's your way of playing, and it will be perfectly fine as long as you agreed with the players before the session that this is your way of GMing. <br/><br/>For me, giving out these clues is more about setting a mood. Player paranoia is quite powerful but also, my group of players are most of the time like Rogger Rabbit: they can't refrain from making a joke, so describing a big red button on a panel with a sign saying "press only on emergency" is way too irresistible for them.<br/><br/>-When players state their reaction, I first try to get an idea of what's the worst that could happen. If that includes the inmediate death or harm for the PC I try first subtly informing the player of the possibility, let other players clarify if they get my drift and so on. Then I ask if they are sure about whatever they plan to do. Players can still change their course of action to this point. Again, even if the worst thing possible is something totally anti-climatic, I'm doing all this to build the atmosphere. No deathtrap, treasure, monster or empty room is fun without building expectative.<br/><br/>And also giving out information for free (even irrelevant information) helps to build confidence with the players. With no confidence, they will doubt anything you put before them, they will kill and loot questgiving NPCs. Having them doubt your intentions limits the potential fun of game to the GM and players plotting against each other. Which yes, it's fun, but isn't the only kind of fun RPGs have. For the rest of the fun, I only need some confidence, so it's not like GMing like you were <i>legal stupid</i> but <i>legal good</i> instead.<br/><br/>-Now, if player's description of their reaction is good enough, makes sense for the logic we're using (see above), or it's simple and yet quite effective, I call for no roll and just describe the results. If the description isn't clear enough or too simple my response always is "could you describe (more on) how you do that?". And only then I ask them to roll, if necessary. <br/><br/>-Rolls can be avoided, I understand that they are totally immersion-breaking for some. That's not only because switching from thinking on words/imaginary space to thinking on numbers/ chance/statistics isn't easy. That alone can ruin a bit the mood, but there's also the fact that the interruption is stalling the action until you track the bonuses you need or the rule you will use. For other players, engaging the system is also fun, and to others it even represents a safe refuge from getting into character, caring about something, seeing something happening to your character and experiencing as if it was done to you. I have both kind of players in my group, so I let them enjoy themselves. The more you accept this duality in RPGs, the faster you adapt and learn to have your fun and let others have theirs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451565/#Comment_451565" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-22T21:54:34+00:00" title="February 22, 2016  9:54PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -Could combat rolls be avoided? I often ask my players to describe their attacks, which weapon they use, how they wield it, to which part of the target they are attacking. I use all this and the roll to describe the consequences. The uncertainty of the roll adds a lot of excitement to the combat for me and my group, but I do need more info than "I hit it with my sword" to describe a consequence. It isn't only because of what happens if they hit, but when the roll fails, I never say "you miss." <br/><br/>It costed me a bit, but I almost totally erased that phrase from my GMing. Failed rolls are the best chance you have to present your opponent NPCs and monsters as cool and threathening. Do not wait until you roll high on your attacks to do so! If the attack roll on them fails, I describe how the PCs aim right, make a swift and deadly attack... and then their opponent does something unexpected, show how experienced they are or maybe just lucky. Or perhaps more than that.<br/><br/>On one occasion the cleric of the party was fighting a bugbear. Until that fight I hadn't prepared anything special for that NPC. But then the cleric made two spell attacks on a row and failed both. I asked him and another PCs for a perception roll (can't remember who but it was a magic-sensitive PC too) The cleric failed, which made sense because he was in the middle of the battle. The other PC made it so I described to him how he saw the aura of the cleric's god behind him, fighting against the aura of a dark god behind the bugbear, and then saw the icon of that god hanging from a collar on the bugbear's neck. Now that particular bugbear was something else, I just let the rolls made sense. And if that bugbear had been able to flee (he died on the next round), it could have become a recurrent villain. It's death became more significative too, as it looked as if the cleric's god had come out victorious that day thanks to his faithful servant and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Going back to the question, yes I think that combat rolls can be avoided, but somehow using them still holds a better appeal to me now because of things like this.<br/><br/>-About <i>triggers</i>, as I mentioned above, it's something I've been playing with since I came up with the idea for my trap generator. My colleage at work had been playing "Orcs must die" while I've been doing the same with "Epic Quest fot he Mighty loot", both tower-defense kind of games where the player also controls a character. It was the list of pre-made traps that gave me the idea, so I ended up simplifying trap creation to getting a trigger and a trap effect together.<br/><br/>So, you could get "step on a slab" as a trigger and "release a giant rolling boulder" as the trap effect on the generator. The beautiful thing is that now you don't need a DC to disable nor a character with a specialized skill to cross it. The GM can simply describe what the PCs see, maybe ask for a perception roll and then is up to the players how to react. For example, I could describe a tiled floor and some linear marks on the walls and the floor through all the corridor. <br/><br/>Then is up to the players to try deduce what could have made the marks and ask further questions, like, if there is any dust on the floor, where or how much. They could also ask about the marks, follow them and see where they go, etc. No roll needed, unless they want to inspect the tiles fo traps. Only then I'd call for a perception roll, but even if they fail it, they can try to walk through whatever place looks safer, jump over the tiles, whatever. They may notice the hatch trough which the boulder falls and lock it. Again, no rolls needed, I only call for perception when the PCs are being careless, saves when they fail those and other skill checks when they test their skills by doing something difficult with them.<br/><br/>So, with David we were wondering if we could expand this trigger mechanics into the rest of the game, like encounters with NPCs and monsters. I'm thinking now that for NPCs things like motivations, objectives and current emotions perfectly act as triggers, so then you fall back to the NPC resources when a certain course of action is triggered. For example, a peasant is motivated by the love of his family and wants to protect them as his objective. He's currently in fear because of rumours of something attacking people in the forest, so as the PCs engage him there, he becames suspicious. He may try to deceive them to go far from the town because of his family, maybe fake symptoms of a plague and tell them it's faw worse on his town, etc. Again, not much needed in terms of rolls, players can try checking on the guy to try find such signs of the disease or try to notice how nervous he is and why. Intimidating him may make him try to run, reassuring him will most probably have a better effect unless done in a suspicious way, and so on.<br/><br/>For monsters, you can add craves, like blood or fear. You can take in consideration the creature needs and attitude, like if it's hungry or territorial. It can be following orders or a geas. The ting is just to identify these triggers, make the creature react according to those and disregard rolls until players can't describe their way out of them. Giving them more information (relevant or not), repeating/clarifying whatever you already gave them and even suggest some courses of action is valid for me when players are stuck. Having things happen is good as well, it helps a lot to make possible reactions clearer for the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451830/#Comment_451830" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-11T04:32:55+00:00" title="March 11, 2016  4:32AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2016 5:42AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of the stuff mentioned above works by giving a nod to both major aspects of the immersive GM's job.  One is to <b>provide immersive fun for the players</b> and the other is to <b>have immersive fun themself</b>.  <br/><br/>It seems to me that most immersionist GMs trade one off against the other.  At any given moment, either the GM interacts with optimized content-creation procedures (for the players' immersive fun), <i>or</i> the GM just envisions the fictional world and iterates it forward, with whatever results emerge from that (for the GM's immersive fun).  Some GMs are way better at one than the other, and find it an onerous chore to wrangle both.<br/><br/>My hope for systems like the "trigger" mechanic above is that using such a system would grow to feel natural pretty quickly, acting more as a "what to focus on" reminder than as a major intrusion into my world-envisioning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
