That's a bunch of work--trust me on this one!<br/><br/>And once you put it out there for free--it's out there for free.  No more reconsidering that.</blockquote>\nMy question is whether there are any tax implications to selling something and immediately turning the profits over to charity. I mean, I know here are things you <i>could</i> do with taxes, but since it solely benefits you, it seems to me that the government won't care if you're fucking yourself out of money you can save on taxes.<br/><br/>Am I off-base?<br/><br/>(PS: Please don't inject me into those other fucking atrocious debates, nor bring them here.

See, charitable donations are tax-deductible, but only if you itemize deductions.  So for us, for example, even though we gave a good chunk to charity it didn't make a difference for our federal tax return because even with the mortgage interest added in, the standard deduction was still higher.  It did make a difference on state income taxes, though.<br/><br/>So it's not as easy as just not reporting it.<br/><br/>I assume you could create your game company as a nonprofit and then directly offset income and donations (and expenses). That still requires keeping track, and I don't know how much paperwork is involved in doing all this.  Maybe Ryan (<i>Finis </i>was nonprofit, right?) or someone else can chime in on this with direct experience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173171/#Comment_173171" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T07:42:38+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  7:42AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have my own business and I hire an accountant.

Before Clinton left Lulu, I heard one of the initiatives he was pushing for was setting it up so that money from purchased books could be sent directly to charities, without having to pass through the author's hands first, but that never happened.<br/><br/>I filed taxes once as One Thousand One.  Sucked balls.  I thought I did everything right and the government still said I fucked up and charged me like $180 because of it.  If I was doing a commercial release again, I would certainly hire some tax folks to handle it for me.  Even then, keeping track of everything is such a pain in the ass.  Better to get a seperate small business credit card and back account and then do all your business transactions (including buying meals at GenCon) through that account.
