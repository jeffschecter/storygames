Here is write-up of Session 1 (composed by player Bob Dushay):<br/>\nWinnie is a character I created to allow for there to be 6 players. Basically take Kale's mechanic skills and give them to Winnie, who also has other spacefarer abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Blackbird: Episode I. (May 23, 2010). <br/>\n<br/>\nLady Blackbird: Dee.<br/>\nNaomi Bishop: Bob.<br/>\nCyrus Vance: Joe.<br/>\nKale Arkam: Lori.<br/>\nWinnie: Katherine.<br/>\nSnargle: Maurice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe crew and passengers of the Owl are captives in the brig of the Imperial warship, The Hand of Sorrow. Lady Blackbird, in disguise as a middle class lady named Raven is frightened. She wants to escape and wonders how she got here.<br/>\n<br/>\nFlashback. Lady Blackbird and Naomi discuss how to find passage to escape Elysium and flee to the Pirate King Uriah Flint\u2019s secret base in The Remnants. Naomi hears that the best ship to be found is the Owl. The two women attempt to negotiate passage, but the suspicious Vance arouses Lady Blackbird\u2019s cautions, and the women leave. The Lady commands Naomi to negotiate passage. Vance and Naomi negotiate hard and end up with a high, but not utterly exorbitant price.<br/>\n<br/>\n In the brig, Kale utters a Dark spell to obscure the camera, and Snargle thins himself to escape through the bars. Snargle slips into the ceiling ventilation system, and lures a guard away. He extends a long finger to trip the door release switch and slips back into the ducts. Vance nudges Lady Blackbird. She calls to a guard, feigning hunger for the brownies (with nuts!) they are eating.  The guard approaches the cell, and Naomi bursts out, doing a terrible violence to him. Vance snags his gun, and they find Snargle crouched over the second, unconscious guard. Naomi asks if they need the guard for anything. Hearing no answer, she dashes his brains out against the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n Vance commands Kale, Winnie, and Lady Blackbird back to the Owl to get it ready to flee. He takes Naomi and Snargle to disable the Hand of Sorrow. On their way to the Owl, Kale, Winnie and Lady Blackbird encounter a small squad of marines. Kale tries and fails to magic them into leaving. Lady Blackbird summons a powerful sorcery and channels the ship\u2019s electrical systems through the marines, killing them in a mighty electrical blast. They flee to the Owl.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Owl is in a docking bay, suspended by a magnetic grip, while Imperial technicians busy themselves in the bay. Kale and Winnie disable the magnetic lock, and the women disappear into the ship. Winnie begins powering the Owl up for departure. <br/>\n<br/>\nVance, Snargle, and Naomi find a crucial junction for the Hand of Sorrow\u2019s control systems, and after Snargle unsuccessfully attempts to disable the junction, Vance shoots it, disrupting ship systems and tripping numerous warning klaxons. The Hand of Sorrow begins listing to starboard and as the heros flee back toward the Owl, they too are accosted by marines. Naomi hurls herself at the Marines and smashes them all with unspeakable violence. But in the docking bay, alarms have been raised. Pilots are rushing to fighter craft, and a detachment of marines begins shooting at Vance, Snargle and Naomi as they rush toward the ramp. Kale shoots at the marines, Vance spins around and blazes away with two captured guns, but the marines take cover and only one is hit; Vance is injured by their return fire. Naomi runs back leaps bodily onto the surprised marines as both Kale and "Raven" provide supporting fire from atop the Owl's gangplank.  Naomi's pit fighter moves smash marines into bulkheads like so many dolls.  While the others attempt to rescue the captain, Snargle activates pilot's control of ship's weapons and blasts away at the hanger doors to ready their exit route. Naomi snatches the wounded Cyrus Vance and rushes aboard the Owl, which lifts of and slips into the Wild Blue, fighters in pursuit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnargle skillfully pilots the Owl and spins and maneuvers her out of the fighters\u2019 reach. The Owl slips away\u2026but the crew unhappily discover the Imperials had offloaded her fuel, and Snargle\u2019s bold maneuvers have nearly exhausted what they have left. If they\u2019re going to reach Haven, they\u2019re going to need to drop down into the Lower Depths and risk the corrosive gases there if they\u2019re going to bring Lady Blackbird to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Blackbird: Episode II. (June 7, 2010).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe role of Lady Blackbird is temporarily taken over by John.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSnargle starts to panic about taking the Owl into the Depths. He reminds Vance of what happened last time: \u201cWe lost half the ship!\u201d Vance, Kale, and Winnie work together to calm Snargle down. Winnie agrees to pump up the Owl\u2019s engines, and Vance agrees to skim near the top of the Depths. Snargle reluctantly brings the ship down, his rapid color changes showing his extreme agitation.<br/>\n<br/>\n To go into the depths, crew members must don protective clothing against the acidic gases. Winnie insists that her engine room is air-tight (and rubber-lined!) while Lady Blackbird retreats to her cabin, not wanting other to see her looking anything but elegant.<br/>\n<br/>\n Kale, manning the gun, spots a squid to the rear, far off but closing fast. The crew prepares for battle. Kale shoots the squid, Snargle skillfully slips and slides the Owl out of its grasp, Winnie wrings out extra speed, and with a final devastating shot from Kale, the squid is frightened off. Luckily for Snargle\u2019s peace of mind, the batteries are now charged enough that Vance agrees to slide out of the Depths and continue to Haven.<br/>\n<br/>\n At Haven, we hear that the Hand of Sorrow is based there, and is expected in port any day now. (It has been out of communication.) The crew and passengers of the Owl are anxious to depart. Vance and Lady Blackbird find a convivial bar to finalize payment, while Snargle heads for a goblin bar to spend time with others of his kind. Winnie shops for supplies.<br/>\n<br/>\n Snargle unwinds by telling stories (\u201cand this time, the damned thing got half of the ship!\u201d) and finds a lucrative deal for the Owl: slip weapons software into Olympia, home of the Imperial Fleet, without getting caught. He seeks out Vance. Meanwhile, Vance tries to get Lady Blackbird interested in him, generating some heat but not much success. Naomi points out to the Lady that Vance would be a good asset for the next leg of the trip and possibly the whole distance out to the Remnants. Vance doesn\u2019t want to go to the Remnants without hearing who Lady Blackbird is (her \u201cRaven\u201d disguise has been worn rather thin, but he hasn\u2019t discovered her true rank). Lady Blackbird refuses to tell Vance her ultimate goal or her identity, but Vance is at least willing to listen to her proposal for travel to another world, not yet specified\u2014Nightport, perhaps? But Lady Blackbird hasn\u2019t suggested that this a goal, and Vance hasn\u2019t suggested that he knows how to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSnargle and Naomi are both frustrated: Snargle because he wants to get rid of the troublesome passengers and work on a real paying job, and Naomi because she feels the Lady is being foolish by not trusting Cyrus Vance at least a little more. Naomi also suspects her own feelings for the dashing captain may be more than mere admiration. She buys Snargle mushroom wine to keep him away from the delicate negotiations between Lady Blackbird and Cyrus Vance, and helps steady his course back to the ship, following her mistress and the captain at a discreet, but not unsafe distance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275119/#Comment_275119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T07:45:42+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  7:45AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was your impression of how the game handled with six players?
