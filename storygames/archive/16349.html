That d8 is now a d10 (rolls of 3 or less with it do not generate danger results).<br/>Dwarf - Stout and Gruff - When you take threat dice (d4s) from danger results, one of the dice is a d6 instead.<br/>Human - Adaptable - You have one additional bonus d8 (total 3) for your Human bonus dice.<br/>Gnome - Illusions - When using Influence moves, you can choose before the roll to inflict +1 hit by taking +1 threat dice after the roll.<br/>Dragonborn - Dragon's Breath - Once per scene, re-roll any Powerful Battle danger dice after your roll. The second roll counts.<br/>Changeling - New Faces - When attempting Deft or Mental Influence moves, choose before you roll: do +1 hit or -1 danger.<br/>Warforged - Metal Man - If you would be taken out, you can spend a any of your bonus die to reduce the danger by 1.<br/><br/><br/>I have no idea about their balance, but these seem suitably "low-impact" while still providing a character with two unique abilities that no one else has. I would love feedback, but I mainly just wanted to put it out there for anyone else looking for ideas.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373319/#Comment_373319" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T20:22:53+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  8:22PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Berserker - Battlefrenzy - When you fly into a frenzied rage in combat, get two extra danger dice that don't cap against your normal limit of five. All of your allies get one extra danger die that doesn't count against their normal limit, representing, well, the frenzied berserker on their side.<br/><br/>Although, I'll be honest, I think you get enough differentiation from a ranger with "Hunter's Instincts 1d8" and "Polyphemus, my one-eyed wolf friend 1d8", and a wizard with "Flame Spiral! -1d8" and "Eylor's Gaze! - 1d8". But to be fair I haven't actually played pocket edition yet, just crushed heavily from afar, and it's possible once the elegant simplicity wears off the cold hard fruit of exception-based design will once again begin to tempt me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373367/#Comment_373367" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T06:26:39+00:00" title="April 18, 2012  6:26AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a degree of differentiation between characters with the bonus d8s the players get to assign, but even one "exception to the rules" power that a player can grab onto, that no one else has, could make a difference in feel.<br/><br/>I really like that Berserker ability.

Fighter more than doubles Weapon bonus dice, which you're likely to be able to use multiple times per scene.  Cleric is either ~-3 danger (removing threat dice) or +3 hits (removing a Complication.)  And Changeling is like a super-sized extra Deft dice, about on par with most of the other once per scene abilities.<br/><br/>Maybe:<br/>Fighter - You can choose to reduce your Hits by one to reduce your Danger rolled by one.<br/>Cleric - You can give up a Prayer Bonus die to remove two threat dice from an ally, or one threat die from a complication.<br/>Changeling - When rolling any bonus die, your Style dice count as any Style of your choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373451/#Comment_373451" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-18T11:37:11+00:00" title="April 18, 2012 11:37AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, those are the abilities I thought were most likely to be a bit much.
