When designing, diagrams and concept art are my key tools. I'm drawn more to comics and animation than the written word. Since almost all RPGs depend heavily on verbal narration, the concept of a wholly visual-based RPG (game where the story is told through images rather than words) is extremely intriguing to me.<br/><br/>To my knowledge, there has been some work in this area. <br/><br/>- Primetime Adventures instructs the players to use the language of film and camera work to narrate ("Okay, close up shot of Dirk slowly raising his gun...")*<br/>- Pixel Bitch uses clipped images from magazines to simulate the graphic adventure genre.<br/><br/>Are there any other examples of this kind of thing? What works, what doesn't? Where else could we push this idea, and what problems would we face**?<br/><br/><br/>* At least I think. I haven't picked up my copy in a while.<br/><br/>** One obvious problem is that verbal narration is easy to generate on the fly by human players. Images aren't. It would be stupid to have to wait 20 minutes for one player to draw a picture of what's going on; that's why you generally need to either rely on pseudo-imagery (like in PTA), cut'n'pasted images from other sources (like in Pixel Bitch), or find a way to everyone else is still active when one player is creating an image.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384233/#Comment_384233" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T13:55:53+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  1:55PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never come up with a mechanic to formalize it, but I have used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_Felt" rel="nofollow">Fuzzy Felt</a> in games in the past as a way of 'depicting the scene, more as a thematic alternative to maps &amp; miniatures really, but it could certainly shortcut the need to wait for someone to finish a detailed drawing.<br/><br/>Oh, and also <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/276877#Comment_276877" rel="nofollow">Doodlerama</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384242/#Comment_384242" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T14:26:20+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  2:26PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2012 2:27PM by zircher.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu Open also has that very cinematic game play style.  The players provide details and increase the size of their dice pool.  Often this is done with a director's flair using camera angles and special effects.<br/><br/>One visual element that I'm notorious for is hand gestures (even when I'm playing via Skype.)  Technically, this is even faster than speech for some people.  While I'd suggest something more elaborate than scissors-rock-paper, it might be possible to make gestures a meaning part of the game mechanics.<br/><br/>Also, you could bring in visually rich gaming elements like tarot cards or casting runes.  Do: Pilgrims of the Temple is a good example of a game that brings in multiple visual and tactile components; a bag of stones, letters, passports, and the very personalized trouble marker.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384265/#Comment_384265" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T18:43:58+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  6:43PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everway and Ganakagok use tarot-like cards to focus gameplay on a series of visual images: you're presented with an image and an idea, and have to work that into the narrative somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384266/#Comment_384266" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T18:49:00+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  6:49PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chronicles of Skin uses a sheet of doodles to keep track of significant places and events in the story you're collectively creating.

I find this resource extremely useful for games like Apocalypse World, where you have a large number of NPCs who may appear briefly, repeatedly, etc. -- assigning each NPC a photograph makes it a lot easier for players to remember who they are, and also (in the case of an interesting photograph) can easily kickstart some basic characterization on the part of the MC.<br/><br/>On the other hand, our group has gone back and forth on using these photographs, in part because they do tend to replace actual verbal description of what characters look like -- which, while it might be good for the OP, is something we are not quite as comfortable with. <br/><br/>The whole 'a picture is worth a thousand words' conundrum is an interesting one, because ultimately there is just no way you are going to actually displace verbal description as the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> medium of roleplaying -- in our case, there was a concern that allowing us to avoid rich verbal description of character appearance might in turn atrophy or limit or discourage rich verbal description in other areas of the game. <br/><br/>You can't find an image for everything, after all -- and imagine a group of NPCs where four of them have super-awesome photographic portraits and the fifth just has a verbal description. Or a game where all the characters have vivid portraits, but there are no pictures of any of the locations. Consider, also, the difference between me saying "he is a handsome, dark-skinned man with a severe look" and showing you a picture of an actual person that I happen to think is handsome and severe-looking. Part of the genius of words in a 'shared imagined space' is that they allow every player to translate them into their own personal-visual world. I might think that this portrait is of a super-hot dude, and you might think he looks like an ugly jerk with bad taste in clothes.<br/><br/>Given how potent visual images are for human beings, I think introducing strong visual elements is not without pitfalls.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384271/#Comment_384271" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T20:02:12+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  8:02PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, I agree with you mostly on one point: that words allow each player to have their own visual interpretation of the shared imagined space. That is one of the reasons a visual RPG has to focus on playing to the strengths of visual art rather than just trying to translate concepts from verbal roleplaying.<br/><br/>One phenomenon worth looking at here is the "jam comic", a genre of activities which when you look at them are basically visual story games. Players collaborate and use rules to decide who gets to draw what panel, and sometimes what they should depict. I had an idea a while ago for a jam comic/story game hybrid that went nowhere (mostly because I was looking at the problem with trad-gaming lenses), but now I'm thinking of giving it another go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384275/#Comment_384275" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T21:00:58+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  9:00PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Old School Hack does a pretty good job of using diagrams and flow-charts.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384276/#Comment_384276" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-03T21:01:31+00:00" title="July  3, 2012  9:01PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2012 9:01PM by johnzo.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the concept of a wholly visual-based RPG (game where the story is told through images rather than words) is extremely intriguing to me.</blockquote>\nEverway used (many beautiful) images as oracles.<br/><br/>Dixit uses (many compelling) images as fodder for a Balderdash-like creative bluffing game.<br/><br/>In old-school D&amp;D, the players produce a map as an artifact of their exploration.  In new-school D&amp;D, visualization tools (maps and figures) are required in order to disambiguate the scene.<br/><br/>In How To Host A Dungeon, the player creates a map to record the story of their play.<br/><br/>Every game that John Harper has run for me has featured significant visual communication, everything from well-chosen found images to sketching.  His Stranger Things game used a set of interlocking city geomorphic tiles as the play environment (I think Tony Dowler drew those.)  Older versions of Danger Patrol required players to make cardstock playing pieces to represent their heroes on the threat display.  I always decorated the hell out of these and got a lot of fun doing so.<br/><br/>Last year at GPNW I met someone who was doing / had done a kickstarter for a big deck of nicely illustrated fantasy NPC portraits.

Like in the Roach, players meet chancellors and professors and boosters and they all have the ornate WASPy names that are largely indistinguishable to me.

I think the "personal-visual world" is a bigger source of pitfalls; I find that it takes a lot of communication overhead to keep everyone on the same page, or at least on compatible pages, and I really appreciate anything that increases the sharing level of the imagined space.<br/><br/>With the picture of the super-hot / ugly jerk, in my experience there's not a risk in that misunderstanding.  Everyone at the table (assuming they're all sighted) have the same objective facts.  The subjective facts (hot or not?) are still up to the player / character.  I'd say that subjective facts and judgments of the situation aren't really part of the SIS.  <br/><br/>(I don't mean to be argumentative here or to say that you're wrong.
