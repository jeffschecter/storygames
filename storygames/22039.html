Since some folks have felt that it is and were willing to share their experience, I think it would be worth setting some goals as a community to be more inclusive.<br/><br/>I am by no means an expert on this, but I'm interested in contributing to a dialogue about it.<br/><br/>My initial suggestions:<br/>- A few more ongoing threads (or regularly renewed topics) that are welcoming to new posters and allow for low-stakes contributions (like "What did you play this week?").<br/>- A greater commitment to defining terms within a thread and avoiding insider jargon where possible.  This could take the form of a regular practice of asking others to define their terms when uncertain.  (I tend to leave jargon-y threads rather than ask for clarification).<br/>- Avoiding conversations across threads where possible.  I sometimes get confused when regular posters seem to be responding to comments from past conversations that I as I third-party haven't read.<br/><br/>I would love to hear more suggestions or things I can do as a member of the forum to be more welcoming to new folks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482587/#Comment_482587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-26T16:24:28+00:00" title="April 26, 2019  4:24PM">April 26</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!

In a current thread I\u2019m cueless to the meaning of abreviations like CA or SIS. If there\u2019s be a kind of sticky jargon post to refer to or, of not there ask clarification for a term, I feel that might help.<br/><br/>In the insular community post there was a mention of women not feeling welcome, but not a mention as to why (that I\u2019ve found), so if some of the wm\u2019en could elaborate on that, that would be nice.

I basically never read or contribute in the casual threads myself, but I'm sure that having a few more of those would do worlds of good for encouraging walk-in participation.<br/><br/>Your suggestions are generally good (as in, concordant with the stated goal), that one just felt particularly clever - I hadn't thought of it myself before. Consciously picking some evergreen yet casual topic that naturally maintains a thread on top of the pile could indeed make a forum seem different. Just have to think of what such topics could be. Something that wouldn't become a chore.

A glossary wouldn\u2019t help, since it changes over time and makes a new reader feel like they have to study up on it before they even join a conversation.<br/><br/>I think we can just keep trying to avoid language we use without definition and ask each other about terms being used.<br/><br/>I\u2019m an old \u201cregular\u201d here and I often need to do a google search about some word or term someone else is using - especially abbreviations.

I might have some really small question/idea/proposal that may not be of interest for the 90% of the visitors but might fit quite nicely the other 10% niche, but since I'm forced to post them in the main page, two undesired side-effects appear:<br/><br/>1) The 90% of the people that are not interested in my idea will naturally drive the conversation towards their preferred topic/point of view.<br/><br/>2) The conversation will get buried quickly because the 90% of the users are talking about other topics.<br/><br/>I don't blame the users of Story-games of any of these (this is something that will happen even in the most respectful discussion forum) but I do think that we all should ponder the pros &amp; cons of the current structure of this forum.<br/><br/>I believe that the "everything goes to the main page" philosophy imposes a high entry barrier to new users but I might be wrong and I have to acknowledge that it also has a strong bonding effect (everyone is encouraged to read everything) that we can loose if we switch to a "multiple ghettos" model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482634/#Comment_482634" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-27T14:48:41+00:00" title="April 27, 2019  2:48PM">April 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point. A rather modern marketing idea occurs to me: one could, should the owner be so inclined, develop a dynamic landing page for the forum with newcomers and casual readers in mind. Basically a more content-oriented replacement for the happy village propaganda poster.<br/><br/>Regular users go directly to the forum anyway, but a dynamic front page could do wonders for highlighting noteworthy and interesting content.<br/><br/>A simple approach to making one would be to do a bit of site development for a page that pulls thread titles from the database based on a given instructions, and then assign one or more regular users with editing rights on the page. These users could then maintain the front page as a place where e.g. the ten most current/interesting topics are featured, possibly with little one-sentence introduction hooks. Unlike the main forum view, they could ignore the evergreen no-content threads in favour of highlighting the things they find relevant for somebody who only visits the forum weekly or monthly.<br/><br/>(There's many ways of doing something like this, of course, I just suggested appointing a couple of editors as the technically and socially simplest way to maintain it. A completely automatic system would involve some sort of thread quality voting, with the front page listing the most voted threads, relying on the users to vote intelligently.)<br/><br/>Such a page would obviously include links to the forum rules and introduction threads and whatnot - the basic content you'd want a newcomer to see.<br/><br/>Developed correctly, this could help with the perceived confusion of the Vanilla forum model without the forum getting lost in a categorization ghetto. (I don't really think that the alternative of moving to a traditional forum display structure is a good one; the topics at SG aren't really very separate from each other, and the amount of activity is so sparse that a general view is what you'll want to use most anyway.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482640/#Comment_482640" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-27T16:42:25+00:00" title="April 27, 2019  4:42PM">April 27</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (What Eero says is true: there was an attempt to create sub forums like Praxis a few times, and they were all abandoned, as far as I can see.

These serve a useful purpose, but when I started reading this forum I didn't understand what they meant for a long time.  It would be helpful to include an explanatory line at the top of the first post, like this:<br/><br/><b>[RR+]</b> This thread is for positive discussion of how to run a game in a railroad style.  If you would like to discuss how to run a game in a different style, or discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a railroad style, please make a separate thread.<br/><br/>Another this that is very helpful (and which I have seen in some threads) is to include links to previous threads in the same "series" or on the same topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482646/#Comment_482646" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-27T17:55:21+00:00" title="April 27, 2019  5:55PM">April 27</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2019 5:57PM by Paul_T.">edited April 27</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree!

I say \u201cinteresting\u201d, because there is a variety of people here, and some tend to write more (like Eero and Sandra, say, perhaps me as well) and others are very terse (like, say, DeReel).<br/><br/>Is the depth of discussion \u201cinconsiderate\u201d, or is it a feature of this forum? I consider it a feature, personally. Such a nice contrast to social media twitter, and all the rest.

IOW the posters themselves were a delight to interact with.  Kudos.<br/><br/>I found that lack of organization off putting.  Not terribly, but I was confused as to where to go looking for certain ideas and what not.<br/><br/>I did note that there is a reasonably consistent use of abbreviations and other means to communicate "commonly" understood ideas quickly and efficiently.  Again, nothing wrong with that in and of itself.  What I was surprised by was the lack of a gloss.  For myself, a gloss is a welcoming effort.  It is a readily available bridge from those who have been discussing a certain topic for a while reaching out to newcomers saying, "Welcome to our community.  This is what we are thinking currently.  Now that you are up to speed please join us!"<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> was correct in that a site like this cannot be all things to all people.  Some posters in this thread have come up with some very compelling suggestions.  But the idea that posts must be short because it places an unreasonable/unfair burden on a reader is rather specious.  If someone only has time for what are essentially sound bites and not in depth reasoned thought then I don't know what to say.  Ideas, especially complex or subtle ideas ones, need space to develop.  No one is forcing anyone to be here.  If they don't have the time to read lengthy posts or threads then this is exactly what a glossary would help to address.  But being told to not think things too deeply is just a little silly especially if that is only a small percentage of what the totality of this site has to offer.<br/><br/>Yes there are lots of excellent things or changes that could be made to make this site "easier" to newcomers.  I don't think dumbing things down is a particularly good option.<br/><br/>But I'm new here and I don't have the weight that the long timers have and that's alright.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Jay                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482703/#Comment_482703" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-29T04:14:49+00:00" title="April 29, 2019  4:14AM">April 29</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 29, 2019 4:17AM by BeePeeGee.">edited April 29</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Is brevity always a virtue? </p></div></blockquote>\nIt certainly isn't a virtue when people just post "lol" etc on social media.

I try to write as long as necessary (such as in this post) and as short as possible.<br/><br/>Please note also that the large part of the world are not native English speakers.

There weren't many articles, but they were very good because they profited from the cumulative knowledge on the forum. What is proposed above is something like that, with more links and less redaction. <br/>I am all for it. The good part being that people just need to do it to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482940/#Comment_482940" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-05T06:19:31+00:00" title="May  5, 2019  6:19AM">May 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the lengthy responses in this forum, but let's be honest, most people who get into forum posting have an acquired taste for reading long threads. I do think, though, a tool to stop an individual poster from hogging the spotlight in a post would be fine, and I think such a tool already exists in this forum (slow-down was it called, only one post per poster per day?).<br/><br/>Regarding the accessibility of the forum to not native English speakers, I think, again, most of us who start reading a forum usually read in English. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to follow the majority of threads that talk about or mention games exclusively in English.<br/><br/>What I'd like is to encourage posters to use formatting tools to highlight the main ideas or sentences in their posts. It would make reading easier for those in a hurry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482945/#Comment_482945" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-05T08:55:41+00:00" title="May  5, 2019  8:55AM">May 5</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the various negative rules or guidelines can do much.

Can we even tell which is the bigger problem, that people come in here and then drop off, or that they don't find about here in the first place?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482958/#Comment_482958" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-06T06:48:52+00:00" title="May  6, 2019  6:48AM">May 6</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of using formatting to highlight main ideas.<br/>Perhaps a TL/DR summary at the end of lenghty posts could be helpful.<br/>Overall, a distinction between [focused] vs [discussion] threads sounds very goood to me.<br/><br/>I think new people may be aftracted by<br/>1. easily accessible user interface (incl. mobile experience)<br/>2. exchange with great people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
