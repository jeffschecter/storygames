It was picked up and contained by the government, hidden away at Secret Government Facility X.  This being was composed of energy and could manifest itself as an aspect of our collective consciousness. Generally the aspect had to be fairly hi-fidelity, i.e consistent over many minds.  The government, through magical and/or technological means, enslaved this being to use it as a weapon, and Mythos was born. But the consciousness of the times did not produce useful archetypes for this creature to transform into. Sure, he could turn into Ismael or the Great Gatsby, but how\u2019s that gonna stop the Huns? <br/><br/>Then along came superhero comics. Superman was *perfect*. The government secretly fostered the comics industry in order to create more of these superheros, the more popular the better. Eventually they established \u201cclearances\u201d for Mythos, so that he could only manifest in \u201capproved\u201d forms that would keep him cooperative. (Sorry, Batman fans).<br/><br/>Basically, I want to throw my players a curve ball. \u201cSo you guys do your superhero thing, and it\u2019s all great, and then The Flash shows up. Which one? Barry Allen. Yes. Really.\u201d Later on Wally West shows up and really throws them for a loop. Of course, only one of these \u201creal\u201d heroes can show up at a time.<br/><br/>The players do their thing, eventually find out about the unfortunate circumstances of Mythos\u2019s stay here on earth, and, ideally free him. At which point, of course, he lashes out against his captors taking the form of Old Testament Yahweh and the heroes have to kill God. Awesome.<br/><br/>Now, I know this plot is totally doable in an old school Supers RPG like Mutants and Masterminds or Champions, but I\u2019m currently in a M&amp;M game (and it\u2019s great) and I want to try out all these little ones I keep hearing about: Truth and Justice, Capes, and With Great Power. But I know these games allow an awful lot of player control and focus more on the individual conflicts of the characters. If there is a metaplot, it\u2019s because players have worked together to create one. Do these systems allow for GM secrets?  Will player narrative authority muck up a perfectly good 5 or 6 session mystery? Which system would work best for something like this?<br/><br/>Thanks for any input!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175214/#Comment_175214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T12:14:17+00:00" title="October 16, 2008 12:14PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of the three you've listed I've only read and played Capes.  I know something of the other two but others will be well versed.<br/><br/>I can tell you that Capes is pretty much out of the question.  You can choose to play strong adversity and you can bring unexpected things but give up any hope of shaping outcomes in the direction you want things to go.<br/><br/>With Great Power is built on very specific super -hero paradigm and so I think trying to impose your own structure on top of the structure built into the game will fail.<br/><br/>Truth and Justice, to my knowledge, while light and flexible still retains the basic assumptions of most traditional RPGs.  It's probably your best bet for infusing with GM delivered structure.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175220/#Comment_175220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-16T14:23:02+00:00" title="October 16, 2008  2:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Jesse.

Second, if the other players don't like your story they can just ignore it. <br/><br/>I know nothing of WGP (other than I've heard great things about it). <br/><br/>But T&amp;J is pretty traditional. There isn't really anything you can do, so far as I know, with M&amp;M that you couldn't do with T&amp;J.

It would work well with meta secrets. In fact, there's even a mechanic for gradually revealing the villain's Plan. There's a lot of player-driven scenes, but these are the personal scenes, as WGP is a very melodrama-driven game.<br/><br/>However, there might be some problem in that in WGP, there are only villains and heroes, and everything else is color. So it depends on how you envisioned Mythos to work. If the government is a villain and Mythos is a henchman, it'll work like clockwork. If Mythos will sometimes assist the heroes, it'd be reduced to color in those scenes.<br/><br/>Also, awesome story idea!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
