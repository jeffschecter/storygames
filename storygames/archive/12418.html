I'm not a compulsive collector but I have a number of free games I've grabbed because I was interested but will never play.\n<blockquote>Do free games get more play than $5 games, or vice-versa?</blockquote>\nI don't really buy cheap games. It just isn't a thing I do, for no particular reason.\n<blockquote>Do you place more value on a game you paid for? Are you more likely to play it? Are you more likely to love it or hate it? Are you more likely to talk about it?</blockquote>\nI have higher expectations of a game I paid money for. I am more critical, so I am more likely to love or hate it. I am not more likely to play it or discuss it, though.\n<blockquote>Does free represent an opportunity cost for a designer? Is a free game a marketing tool? Is it a statement?</blockquote>I think they can't help but be marketing tools, if people enjoy and play them. That's the very best kind of marketing. I guess it can be an ideological choice, but that's wildly variable. I like free and don't want it to go away. The fact that you can charge five bucks does not mean you should. Down that road is a lot of ill will.\n<blockquote>Is a free game more likely to inspire you to hack it? To approach the designer about it?

I've played a ton of Jonathan's games in various stages of playtest, and they've all ended up free eventually or never quite finished. So I don't think that counts. I've seen screenshots of Lady Blackbird and think it's lovely, but our gaming plates are really full in WMass, so I can't imagine finding the time to play it. (Part of the culture here is that everyone's got a game they want to playtest, or that's ALMOST done, or that they just finished and want to enjoy. I guess Apocalypse World is technically "out" now, so I don't know if it counts because we've been playing it on and off for a year or more; but I pretty much ONLY play games that are already in publication at cons. Otherwise it's exclusively playtests.) <br/><br/>I really should download it, because I want to see the prettiness, but I just keep forgetting. It's not like the urgency of "Oh, well I have $5 free NOW, I should get it." <br/><br/>Shreyas and I, as the two main (but not only!) people of 2SP, keep going back and forth about releasing free games. There are a couple of things I have going around in my brain I'd like to release for free; he's completely against free product as discounting the worth of your creation. There's a couple children's games we've been noodling about forever, and should they ever get done, all profits would go to a charity\u2014 so it's not just about money for the creator, I guess. I don't know.<br/><br/>My completely-uninformed prejudices about free games include the following (note: all do not apply to every game):<br/><br/>- The author/designer has sales baggage <br/>- The author/designer isn't confident in their design<br/>- The author/designer doesn't want to put the time in the product would need to make it saleable<br/>- The author/designer abandoned the game in the hopes someone else would finish/hack it<br/><br/>None of them actually are value judgements, in and of themselves, and I can see releasing a game for free for any of those reasons. The last three don't inspire confidence in a usability sense, though. I also don't do as much hacking as most do, so picking up a game with an eye to hack it isn't a thing I do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279073/#Comment_279073" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T08:02:03+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  8:02AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite free games are Fate 2.0 and GHOST/ECHO  I've played the hell out of both of them.  I don't really collect free games.  I don't think price has any impact on my decision whether or not to play a game a lot.  I hear that is it human nature to place more value on things we pay for, but I don't recognize that tendency in myself  for rpgs at least.  I talk some about games I've had the opportunity to playtest and those often don't cost me anything.  I do like to be able to ultimately own a "finished" printed artifact that's got nice design and/or layout and/or artwork over a free game that may be just a printed Word document.  That typically costs money.<br/><br/>As to opportunity cost, it depends on what the designer does later.  The big example again here is Fate.  Its free availability and the culture and forums that sprung up around it as a result were a springboard for SotC's success, and now there's the Dresden Files game.  I guess it was a marketing tool in that sense, though maybe not consciously.  Fate was likely free in part because of the pre-existing FUDGE culture.  A couple designers that offer free games have made posts about it being a form of statement, expressing a particular ideal.  I've made and hacked lots of games in the last 30 years and I've never shared any of them online.  They're free to the groups I play them with.  No statement, just a preference.<br/><br/>Playtesting and hacking games makes me feel some sense of ownership of a game.  They're generally free at the playtest phase but I don't think the fact that it was free at that point is what made me want to hack it (if I do).  The game's design accessibility is what will make me want to hack it or not.  I suspect a lot of games that are only $5 will have such a tight focus/application, that their design won't often be one that wants hacking.<br/><br/>At my income relative to my free time there really isn't much difference to me between a free game and a game that costs $15-$20.  It just occurs to me that I might prefer it if more games were either free or $40 or more dollars.  My shelves might be less full of games that I picked up because they were inexpensive but that I will never find the time to play either because they're basically betas that people went ahead and published anyway, or simply because there are other games I prefer to play or playtest.  (this is not a slam on any of the games that happen to be at that price point)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279074/#Comment_279074" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T08:07:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  8:07AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah.

I don't even remember half of them. Many "big" games have free versions (Savage Worlds test drive, FATE SRD, d20 SRD, TSoY). You can also find rules for many smaller games free online (Kagematsu, Puppetland, 1001 Nights...). It's hard to say what is what.<br/><br/>Then obviously there are things like John Harper's free catalogue which is amazing. Also, the stuff we toss at each other on forums. Half-finished ideas, ashcans, playtests. Those are also games and free. I still want to play Rock of Tahamat: Space Tyrant one day.<br/><br/>As for the questions...<br/>1. I don't think I have a favourite, although Lady Blackbird has a special spot in my heart, too.<br/>2. No clue. I'd say that if you take the average of smaller games they get about the same amount of play. Maybe free games get a little more. If you DO count stuff like the Savage Worlds test drive book and FATE, well obviously free games get more play than 5$ ones. 5$ games don't really get that much play.<br/>3. Yes, I generally expect value for my money's worth. However, many free games offer more than many priced ones, so it's a weird thing.<br/>4. What Jason said.<br/>5. No, not really.

Eventually I wrote two, since a diceless version could be used even on walks or in the spa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't really have the free time to play more than one RPG.  If I had found one designed for two people, I would have used it, whether it was free or I had to buy some rulebooks.  I'm only using a free RPG because there was an unfilled niche.  Once I finish typing up the setting, I'll keep it free simply because it does fill a needed niche and I would want other couples (whether spouses living together or best friends who hike together weekly) to have easy access to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279084/#Comment_279084" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T08:45:15+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  8:45AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2010 8:45AM by Ry.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a few free games, the ones that jump to mind are John Harper's (Ghost/ECHO and Lady Blackbird)  <br/><br/>I've also played free demos editions of commercial games.<br/><br/>Honestly, the most important factor is whether it captures my imagination.

Nixon<br/><br/>I have downloaded John Harper's kit games (e.g. Lady Blackbird, Ghost/Echo, Wildlings) and am eager to play those.<br/><br/><b>Playability</b>: This is an important question. If I were downloading free games that the designers hadn't at least tested, I could be headed for an awful experience. I'm pretty inventive and can adjudicate things easily on the fly, so I don't mind a few flaws or vague bits in a free game. Luckily, all the above games are <b>Excellent</b>. They work with little or no interpretation/adjudication at the table. To state a comparison, I buy a lot of John Wick's cheaper games ($5-10), and while I think they are totally worth it, I have found them to reflect a lack of testing or at least an incomplete communication of the rules. (Schauermarchen is a good example of one that I think has incomplete mechanics and may not ultimately "work." But it was worth $5 just for the seeds it sewed in my brain. Cat is an example of a better Wick game with a similar price.)<br/><br/><b>Worth</b>: I'm using this word to describe the financial worth of these documents to me. In other words, what would I pay for them or would I make a donation for them. In most cases I would be willing to pay the designer<b> around $10 for a PDF</b> of the games, depending upon how "done" they are and how clean the layout is. I did buy Donjon (totally worth it). Obviously a lot of these games could be illustrated and expanded to the point where they would be worth quite a bit more than $10, but then I would ironically be less interested in them. I like the "sketchy" quality of free or very cheap games. I would be willing to donate to a designer after playing their free game (and have).<br/><br/><b>Ownership</b>: I don't know that I feel more ownership over a free game. In some ways, I am LESS inclined to hack a free game than one that is more complex and for which I paid more money. I'm not sure I can explain that. Maybe it's because to pick up and play a free game it has to attract me a lot to begin with. Also, free games tend to leave more up to me anyway. The stuff I usually drift in pay-for-it games (usually the setting and mechanical subsystems) are less developed in a free game, which suits me to a T. I wanted to do that stuff with my group and/or on my own anyway.<br/><br/><b>"Collectibility"</b>: For sure. I tend to grab free games when I see them. At the same time, I purge them frequently. After I give them a quick read through, I trash them if they aren't something I either want to play or steal an idea from. So I don't have a huge collection of free games, but the ones I do keep I love. Conversely, I have a hard time trashing a file or book that I paid for, even if it has little value for me. So my collection of paid-for games is bigger but I am less emotionally tied to most of the items in that collection.<br/><br/><b>Statement</b>: Hell yeah. Free games make a statement that I like. I think they are made by people that prefer the word "hobby" to "industry". They are made by people whose primary goal is fun and creativity. I love free games and the people that make them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279091/#Comment_279091" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T09:19:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  9:19AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2010 9:26AM by J_Walton.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Free games I've played in the last year: Danger Patrol, Apocalypse World (though there were sold copies of that too), Geiger Counter*, Danger Sxool*, Mare Caspium.*  The starred ones may not count, since they are my own games.  Free games that I've collected for being really awesome or important to learn from but never played: Scarlet Wake, Radiant, probably a couple others.  I've played probably dozens of other free games over the years: Afraid, Drowning and Falling, various drafts of things, etc.<br/><br/>I honestly think it's a bit funny that Elizabeth says she's never played a free game when she's been playing Apocalypse World a whole bunch and the commercial version has only been out for a week or so <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  In my mind, playtest drafts are free games, because there's no guarantee that they will ever appear in a later version.  Afraid and Scarlet Wake are great examples, where the version we have may be the only version that ever exists, so we have to make do with it.<br/><br/>Honestly, for me, it doesn't matter how much I pay for a game, if it's a playtest draft or a finished product, if it's in print or PDF, etc.  If it's a compelling game that's really exciting and it's in a solid enough state that I feel confident about bringing it to the table, I'll at least give it a go and have no problem playing a half dozen sessions of it. There are plenty of reasons to NOT sell a game -- like not wanting to run a business or wanting to share something with friends rather than entering into a commercial relationship or embracing a model of incremental development that may eventually lead to a commercial release (cf. Geiger, Danger Patrol, etc.) -- so I certainly don't think commercial games are better than free games, either inherently or just in common practice.<br/><br/>To answer Jason's questions more directly, I'm much more likely to be upset with a commercial game that doesn't deliver the promised play experience or which I can't figure out how to play properly from reading the instructions.  That's probably unfair, but it's easy to get caught up in thinking that what you're actually buying is a good play experience and not a bunch of text and play materials, even though you can't, like, blame Victoria's Secret for bad sex.  But that's my impulse anyway.<br/><br/>I don't think of free games as an opportunity cost, a marketing tool, or a statement.  In my mind, free is a natural part of the process, basically the DEFAULT way to release game material, and commercial publication is the mode that requires more thought, planning, and careful consideration.  "Should I release this for free?" is never a thought I've ever had.  "Should I release this for money?" is the question I'm constantly asking myself about products.  Games are like any other creative act that I share with my friends.  Writing games is like cooking a meal for people; charging them for the meal just seems silly. Now, some folks do want to run a restaurant and you still charge your friends when they come eat at your restaurant, so that makes sense too, but it's a pretty different thing.  And I can also understand the $5 game phenomenon as a way of saying: "Hey, can you guys chip in a few bucks to help cover costs?" or as a way of supporting the community, like they do in indie comics. However, as in indie comics, I think it's better to trade $5 games between designers (for free) on the assumption that everybody can turn out a $5 game.  I've seen that kind of thing happen (and, in fact, owe Jackson a game from such an exchange), so that's awesome.<br/><br/>I hack everything. There's a slightly stronger incentive to hack when the designer has said that they welcome free and commercial products based on their games, but Vincent welcomes both commercial and non-commercial hacks of Apocalypse World and Luke's welcomed non-commercial hacks of Mouse Guard (they both have set up sub-forums for them, which is awesome), so that's not really restricted to free games.  Solid hacks are great things to see and many an independent game started life as a hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279092/#Comment_279092" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T09:20:02+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  9:20AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play, GM or buy for different reasons...<br/>\n<br/>\n- I play if my friends are excited about the game.<br/>\n- I GM if the game is easy to use.<br/>\n- I buy because of the above, to support someone, to learn something or if friends want but can't afford it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I can afford it, money doesn't enter into any of the above for me. The only time free or cheap is an advantage is if I'm curious about a game but not sure. Then the ability to try for free or cheap is a huge advantage. Which is why many higher priced games also have free quick start rules or preview materials.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I personally count OGL, Fate, TSoY as free games or systems for myself because they are essentially marketing for commercial products (which isn't a bad thing) and I own the commercial products tied to those games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't GM or play many free games but that's probably due to a lack of support (which makes me resistant into putting any work into GMing it) or marketing (if my friends haven't heard about it they can't be excited about it) for the game. But that can be true for commercial products as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am more likely to play a game that I buy (or gift it) because I don't want to waste money.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow likely I am to talk about a game completely depends on if I play it and what the experience was, not how much it costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not more likely to hack a free game.

Otherwise it's exclusively playtests.)<br/></br></br></blockquote>\nLike I said, nuanced.<br><br>I think there's a huge difference in a free game and a playtest game. Playtest games aren't provided to you with the assumption that you will have fun. I love Apocalypse World, I think it's fantastic, but the main reason I agreed to play in both games I've been in wasn't just "to have fun." I agreed to playtest something for my friend, so that he could take feedback and make the game better and ready to publish.<br><br><b>Playtesting is not free.</b> Never, nuh-uh. Now, you love to hack, so YMMV: but when I sit down to play a published game, I'm not devoting a big chunk of my brain to critically deconstructing what we're doing and how it could be better. I don't stop the GM in the middle of a scene and go "I think this rule is trying to accomplish X and failing, what if you made it do Y?" I sit back and put all my brain into enjoying the game as presented. Being a good playtester is <b>hard work.</b> The game you play isn't always to a place where it's FUN yet, or may not even be completed, so the GM/designer may need or want you to help playstorm through the missing bits. That's completely different.<br><br>And even though I don't feel this way when people playtest MY games: if I playtested something for an author, had a great time, and didn't let them know what worked and didn't and WHY I had a great time, I'd kind of feel like I was stealing from them. ESPECIALLY if I knew they had designs on publication.<br><br><br><br><br/>*If you'd played the first version of Apocalypse World and saw how hot it was from the very beginning, and how dedicated Vincent was to it, you'd have seen that it was headed to publication in the first 20 minutes of the first session. I wouldn't normally assume every game is going into publication either, but AW was a definite exception.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279104/#Comment_279104" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T10:34:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 10:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2010 9:10PM by ccreitz.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No one has actually posted anything about their experiences with a game &lt;$0.

I'm <i>that committed</i> to making it the first game that costs less than zero dollars. If you don't want a US penny, I have a limited supply of Europennies, Canadian pennies, and for a lucky few, one rupee coins which are actually worth more like 2.1 cents. If you happen to find yourself in Bangalore near the old airport, you can upgrade your idli-sambar breakfast at the New Shanti Sagar to include coffee for two rupees (if I recall correctly), so that's pretty good.<br/><br/>Anyway, "Nasocorn" is a short game, playable in an hour or two, GM-less and zero prep. It highlights the connection between absurdity and cruelty, and it tends to be funny because it's so tragic. Its black humor (and incompetence-based slapstick) has a lot in common with <i>Paranoia</i>, so if you like that, you should read "Nasocorn." It's interactive, improvised Ionesco/Mike Judge fan fiction, so if you liked <i>Office Space</i>, and you dig the Theater of the Absurd, this is the game for you! Also, if you read any of Robert Sapolsky's books about the physiology of stress, and thought "Gee, I'd like to play a game about that," I have that market cornered.<br/><br/>If you print it out two-sided, it has the front and back covers mentioned in the text which will enable you to upgrade your nose when play renders it appropriate.<br/><br/>As for people who have already played: Jackson, Joe, and Kaleigh, if one of you gives me a contact address, or happens to be in the Bay Area soon, I'll hook you up with pennies. John and Kathy, if either of you happens to lurk this thread, I'll penny you too. I am giving myself a penny as I write this, right... NOW.

For most of the games I play, I have to think back and remember whether they were free or cost money. It doesn't seem to affect whether I play it or how much I'll play it. I don't hack games very much, but the few times I do, it doesn't matter whether the original is a free PDF or a nice, fancy book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279110/#Comment_279110" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T11:03:42+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 11:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Elizabeth:</b> I apologize if my response came off as annoying. I meant "interesting" when I said "funny," because it seems like we approach playtest documents pretty differently, which is good to know.  In the past, I've definitely felt that "playtesting is hard work / may not even be fun," but I think I'm at a different place (different, not better) with it now and discussing this is actually making me realize that.  So I'm trying to put my finger on my current perspective when I haven't really articulated it clearly before.  I'm sorry if I'm coming off as an inarticulate douchebag.\n<blockquote>Playtest games aren't provided to you with the assumption that you will have fun... when I sit down to play a published game, I'm not devoting a big chunk of my brain to critically deconstructing what we're doing and how it could be better. I don't stop the GM in the middle of a scene and go "I think this rule is trying to accomplish X and failing, what if you made it do Y?" I sit back and put all my brain into enjoying the game as presented. Being a good playtester is<b>hard work.</b>The game you play isn't always to a place where it's FUN yet, or may not even be completed, so the GM/designer may need or want you to help playstorm through the missing bits. That's completely different.</blockquote>\nDefinitely, but I think there could be a different approach to playtesting where:<br/><br/>-- you assume that playtesting is fun, not hard work<br/>-- you don't stop play in the middle to talk about it (or minimize that)<br/>-- it's not critical to discover every problem with the game ASAP; they can gradually become clear over time<br/>-- you don't assume that playtesting will lead to future drafts or commercial publication<br/><br/>Basically, I think there's a place where playtesting is basically inseperable from just playing a free game, in whatever form it currently exists.  Like, if I was going to run Scarlet Wake, it would be hard for me to get in contact with the designer and give him feedback and, even if I did, there's no reason for me to think he would take my feedback and use it to make a better draft somewhere down the road.  While labeled a "playtest draft," Scarlet Wake is basically a free game now.  And I guess my current impulse is to say that I personally like that approach to playtesting better, playtesting without future expectations, playtesting that is basically just play.  It can still be critical or explorative, but I'm often critical and explorative when trying "finished" games.<br/><br/>I think we can see evidence that other folks are already embracing this approach in some ways.  When people run Geiger Counter now, sometimes they send me feedback, but often times they're just doing it because they like the game and want to play it.  So it's not so much that I'm suggesting a new approach to playtesting that I discovered, but that I'm watching how people approach Geiger or how I approach Danger Patrol, say, and feeling like -- especially with free products -- the line between play and playtesting isn't very distinct.  And, honestly, I think that makes playtesting a lot more fun, even if the process of game development is often slower, because the focus is on enjoying the game rather than fixing the game.  Fixing the game becomes a byproduct of play rather than the purpose of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279112/#Comment_279112" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T11:05:08+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 11:05AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, that out of the way...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>[...] the ability to try for free or cheap is a huge advantage.</blockquote> I'm with John. I've played quite a few free games over the last couple of years, plus done a lot of playtesting, and my current play wishlist is about half free - the only non-free, non-micro game on there is AW. Having to buy a book is a hump I need to push myself over, even if it's just $1. If all I have to do is download a game, then I'm talking about it with one the guys in my group over lunch, getting excited about it, and pitching it to the group shortly after. Ghost/Echo took me about an hour to go from seeing to reifying, faster than anything but "Puppetland" (a microgame, from before the era of ubiquitous Internet distribution) in my gaming history. The low activation energy for playing free games makes up for a lot of lack of polish, even if you grant (counterfactually) that free games are never polished. "Lady Blackbird" was better-finished than D&amp;D3.0.<br/><br/>In this thread, and in others, I've seen it said that you can't expect to have fun when playtesting. I just thought I'd say that that's ridiculous, and if you really feel that way, why bother? Sure, it's harder than regular play, but it is still play, and it's still supposed to be fun, because that's what play is! I've done dozens of playtests and enjoyed every one, even when the games themselves weren't good. Even for the most awful bag-on-head game I've ever tested, the playing part was enjoyable and funny (the latter at the expense of the designers, I'm afraid), and if it ever happened that I weren't having fun, I'd stop, write up what went wrong, and pull out Catan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279119/#Comment_279119" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T11:43:36+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 11:43AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I'm breaking this off onto its own thread, so as not to derail the free game thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279125/#Comment_279125" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T11:58:49+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 11:58AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to download and play a lot of free games. As i've gotten older/more busy in my real life I do this less and less. I take a look/read through of anything John Harper whips up, because his work is just sooo bleedingly good. Would i pay for it though? I don't know, maybe mustang. Otherwise...<br/><br/>I do download an aweful lot of free apps, mostly games, try them out and then either upgrade to a paid version that i grow bored of quickly or just feel satisfied with what i've got. The time investment, the getting people together and prepare something is so high with roleplaying that i really need to believe in a game to undertake it. I don't really believe in free games (i dont' have enough faith in them). If i was able to play totally on my own, a true 1 player experience, i would be much more inclined. <br/><br/>It's all a return on investment thing, isn't it? I've invested money in a book, so i'll spend more time to make that investment worth while. For a free game i've put nothing on the table, so i don't have a huge incentive to make it happen. There's no initial investment, so there's very little impetus for me to move forward with the product. <br/><br/>I'm not very much of a hacker or modder, so that's not a big factor for me. An incomplete game is just that, incomplete.<br/><br/>Also, free tends to mean PDF, and if it's not an object i can hold in my hand i tend to forget about it completely.

What free games do you play the hell out of?</blockquote>\nEasily, my favorite free games have been Danger Patrol and Lady Blackbird. While I've only played Lady Blackbird a little, owing to various time constraints, I HAVE played the hell out of Danger Patrol, to the extent of having several hacks for it, a special box where I keep all of the markers, cards, and chits, and a dozen new ideas ever day that I want to try playing with. I'm also very fond of DungeonSlayers. Really, really good game.\n<blockquote>Do you "collect" free games you'll never play?</blockquote>\nI have collected, easily, over a hundred various free games, usually out of curiosity, to see what other people are trying. Of those I never play (which is 99% of them), about an eighth I use as inspiration for my own games (particularly Vanguard and Dungeon Squad), a quarter are for nostalgia (like my free versions of Time Lord and Ghostbusters...the latter which <i>may</i> not actually be legal...), and the rest are soon forgotten, though not deleted.\n<blockquote>Do free games get more play than $5 games, or vice-versa?</blockquote>\nAt least in my circles, it depends on how excited the game gets everyone. Again with Danger Patrol, once people got a taste for it, they didn't want to do anything else for quite some time.\n<blockquote>Do you place more value on a game you paid for? Are you more likely to play it? Are you more likely to love it or hate it? Are you more likely to talk about it?</blockquote>\nWhile initially, I think I do place more value on a spendy game, but surprisingly I am not more likely to play it. Of course, I am an avid game collector, and have maybe only played about a quarter of my collection. But when I think of some of the books I have purchased, particularly over the last 10 years, I do begin to think that maybe some of the expensive games are a waste of time. I recently got rid of almost all of my D&amp;D 3/3.5 books, GURPS 4th, and a bunch of others, realizing I would never play them/play them again, and have been more austere with recent purchases. And I am much more likely to be vocal about a game, if I paid a lot of money for garbage. When I got D&amp;D 4th, and read through the rules, I was disgusted that I spent so much money on it, and tried to recoup my loss as quickly as possible. Same thing for a few RPGnow orders (Slasher Flick, Supers, Icons, Directors Cut, etc.), where I seriously wish they had some sort of extensive preview so I could've known what I was buying. With free and super-cheap games? It's almost inconsequential if they suck. And if they kick ass? I am much more vocal in the praise.\n<blockquote>Does free represent an opportunity cost for a designer? Is a free game a marketing tool? Is it a statement?</blockquote>\nThis can vary quite a bit, I think. Many times, particularly with playtests, free games are indeed a marketing tool. But what better way to get good word-of-mouth than by giving out free versions of the game, asking for feedback, and making people feel like they helped to contribute.<br/>But, at least on my side of things, free games are more a creative outlet. I've only recently started uploading games I've made, and I plan to make every single one of them free, at least in PDF format. I know I can never be a professional game designer, especially since the market for what I make would be a very niche group, but I like to think that if what I make is out there, waiting for someone to pick it up, eventually someone will give it a shot.\n<blockquote>Is a free game more likely to inspire you to hack it? To approach the designer about it? Do you feel more "ownership" of a free game?</blockquote>\nHmmmm...this is a tough one. Hacking is such an...unofficial thing, at least typically. Only recently have there been free games that I've been wanting to hack. Before that, I was always hacking established systems, usually trying to marry components of one system to the rules of another. But, I do guess with the creative commons licenses typically included with free games, it does give you that option.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279179/#Comment_279179" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T23:05:41+00:00" title="July  2, 2010 11:05PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a relative newcomer to the story gaming community, my main exposure to the games that story gamers like has been through free games.

I think free games are great. I still am amazed this game is free! It's value is also unappreciated, I think.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote>Do free games get more play than $5 games, or vice-versa?</blockquote>\nI can't tell. But, actually, it's because I don't know about very many $5 games.<br/><br/>That said, my perception is free games get played less than paid games -- say, $10-$20 games. \n<blockquote>Do you place more value on a game you paid for? Are you more likely to play it? Are you more likely to love it or hate it? Are you more likely to talk about it?</blockquote>\nI am more likely to place value on paid games, I think. However, I also think very, very few games live up to what I expect from a free game, so that's a factor. Most have little, poor, or no presentation design, which I value. They also tend to be unappealing to my fellow gamers, so I value games that do have such appeal. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote>Does free represent an opportunity cost for a designer? Is a free game a marketing tool? Is it a statement?</blockquote>\nYes,  free game is a marketing tool. How well it works is up for discussion certainly, but that is my exact aim with free 44 and Nine Worlds. I've collected hundreds of emails to later contact fans with marketing messages.<br/>\n<blockquote>Is a free game more likely to inspire you to hack it? To approach the designer about it? Do you feel more "ownership" of a free game?</blockquote>\nAh, great question. I think it matters in terms of what kind of assets are available easily. Can I contact the creator? Can I easily port his game's text so I can edit it?<br/><br/>Those are factors that lead to me tinkering, and this is reasonably common among free games (Fate 2.0 and TSoY for examples).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279215/#Comment_279215" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T13:56:21+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  1:56PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may be blind, but is there a free version of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> still around somewhere?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279217/#Comment_279217" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T14:11:33+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  2:11PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">TSoY wiki.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279219/#Comment_279219" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T14:14:17+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  2:14PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's here: <a href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/" rel="nofollow">http://tsoy.crngames.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279226/#Comment_279226" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-03T15:43:56+00:00" title="July  3, 2010  3:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The free game I've had to most play out of is Fate.<br>At the time it came out, it definitely wasn't part of a marketing push for SotC or dresden, or whatever - it was 'just' a hack of fudge - I was playing it before it was called fate, actually, from its first articles in the free fudge factor ezine. For several years, everything I ran was some variant of fate so I got a lot of play out of it.<br><br/>I have run several campaigns using the Pool, and also one of its variants, the Puddle, which were great. There are numerous others that I've had fun with.<br/><br/>I have playtested a few games, but I don't consider that to be the same as playing free games. If I was to count those, Stranger Things would be the top of my free games list - it blew the socks off both groups I played it with.<br/><br/>I'd like to play Danger Patrol and Lady Blackbird, along with 44 and a Dirty World, when I get the chance. I've also used stuff from a bunch of free games, like Otherkind, tSoY, and Lords of Middle Earth. <br/><br/>Price of a game is not at all a factor in whether I choose to play a game. Also, since I will play games from a PDF at my computer in preference to a printed book, if I have the PDF, there's no difference in the tactile feel of a free download and bought game for instance. The games I buy, I buy to see the system - the same reason I download free games. Then, later, when I come to play, I think about the systems and settings that have me fired up, and I play one of them. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with free games, is that there are so many of them - it's hard to figure out which ones to download. Again, this is no different from bought games - there are so many of those that I have no interets in. The difference there is, there are reviewers who serve as a way to find out something about the game before devoting effort to buying and reading the book.<br/><br/>These days, the bigger a rules book is and the more setting material it has, the less likely I am to use it. For that reason, free games, and also indie games in general, have a much easier time of grabbing my attention.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279326/#Comment_279326" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T07:48:39+00:00" title="July  5, 2010  7:48AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2010 7:49AM by Queex.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What are your favorite free games? What free games do you play the hell out of?</blockquote>\nIn both cases the ones I've written myself, but that's more down to the fact that I write stuff I want to play rather than quality. I love G/E for its minimalist audacity, but having played it once I'm not champing at the bit for another session (only because the novelty has worn down a little).\n<blockquote>Do you "collect" free games you'll never play?</blockquote>\nNot really. \n<blockquote>Do free games get more play than $5 games, or vice-versa?</blockquote>\nIn may case, the only games that have got heavy play are your standard \xa320 large format rule book, but I don't think that's indicative of anything. Games that get heavy play are an edge case.\n<blockquote>Do you place more value on a game you paid for?</blockquote>\nHell, no. That was the publisher/writer's decision. I consider a price tag on a game an unfortunate necessity for the time and expertise required to make it. It's the core idea, be it mechanical or setting, that sells me on the game. Polish is an optional extra.\n<blockquote>Are you more likely to play it? Are you more likely to love it or hate it? Are you more likely to talk about it?</blockquote>\nNo to all of the above. The 'new hotness' in my gaming group gets talked about, as do any interest new releases, but actually the simpler something is to describe, the more we tend to talk about it. Smaller games are usually easier to express succinctly, so it's easier to talk about them.\n<blockquote>Does free represent an opportunity cost for a designer? Is a free game a marketing tool? Is it a statement?</blockquote>\nThe opportunity cost is in writing it. Certainly in my case, I'd write them anyway. I just decided one day that for my next project I would make sure to wipe its arse and put it on display.<br/><br/>Does the author intent, in terms of marketing or as a statement, matter to the potential 'buyer'?\n<blockquote>Is a free game more likely to inspire you to hack it?</blockquote>\nI actually seldom hack games. If I don't want a game as written, I'm more inclined to try to write one that scratches the itch I want instead.\n<blockquote>To approach the designer about it?</blockquote>\nIn a 'full' release, there are people other than the writer who can field questions. I'm not sure whether that makes me more likely to contact them or less. I think it's more how committed I feel to a game that drives me to seek out experts on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/docholaday" title="docholaday"><img alt="docholaday" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/docholaday">docholaday</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281170/#Comment_281170" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T15:23:21+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  3:23PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to see a dozen or two very short free games collected in one handsome print volume and the profits split among contributers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281172/#Comment_281172" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T15:30:43+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  3:30PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: docholaday</cite>I would love to see a dozen or two very short free games collected in one handsome print volume and the profits split among contributers.</blockquote>\nNorwegian Style.<br/><br/>I don't know if they split the profits, but the games were shared on a blog, then collected and sold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281180/#Comment_281180" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T16:43:08+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  4:43PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what all I've played that's been a free game, but definitely my favorite would have to be Cold Iron.

While I wouldn't say I play the hell out of them, I wouldn't say that about any game. And, oddly enough, there are fewer unplayed free games in my collection than unplayed paid for games in my collection.<br/><br/>Free games get more play than five dollar games. I don't think I've ever played a five dollar game.<br/><br/>I don't find that I place any particular value on games I purchased, certainly not more than free games. I own more paid for games than free games, and it seems that the play is about fifty fifty. I don't think I like paid for games any more than free games. But when it comes to talking about it, I talk way more about free games than I do about paid for games. Way more.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why people release their games for free, although when I hear people express why they want money for their games, more often than not, they make me want to pirate (not unlike the music industry). Things like, paying money makes one more likely to play makes me want to prove them wrong. Paying money shows than my work is worth something, same thing, I am though, highly anti-capitalistic, viewing capitalism as a highly dysfunctional relationship between people. So people who equate worth with money, either their own or their creations, make me specifically want to never give them any money whatsoever.<br/><br/>I've never hacked a game, and were I to do it, it would probably be to a game I've paid for. But that is a, a mechanics thing, and b, just because there are some cool games out there where I love 90% of the mechanics, and absolutely despise 10% of them. And I think it's worth it for me, to alter the ten percent so that I can enjoy the ninety.<br/><br/>Uh, I don't think I get the ownership question. On the flip side, I'm not sure I buy the notion that if I have a book sitting in front of me, that anyone owns it. Not me, not the creator, not the publisher, nobody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281262/#Comment_281262" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T09:52:15+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  9:52AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite free games, in tune with many others, are Geiger Counter, Ghost/Echo, and Lady Blackbird.

Now you couldn't do that forever, but it would certainly be worth the first $50 to get your game out there quickly (especially if the name and the payment were linked, e.g. "Buck Fiddy: The RPG" costing -$1.50).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283426/#Comment_283426" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T00:44:27+00:00" title="July 29, 2010 12:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's assuming more people would download/read your game if they got a quarter than if it were free -- kind of a leap, really.
