If you like the format, I encourage you to do the same!</i><br/><br/>I'm reading through Dogs and trying to get a better handle on the system, and a couple of questions came up:<br/><br/>1. In some situations, there is no advantage to escalating (except inflicting more serious fallout).<br/><br/>For example, let's say we start talking, then go into a fistfight, during which I pull out my gun and hit you over the head with it. Since I've already rolled all my Stats, and my dice for my gun, I gain absolutely nothing by escalating to gun-fighting. (I'm pretty sure I got that right.)<br/><br/>My question: is this a quirk of the system, just an odd thing, or is it a deliberate design feature? If it's deliberate, what's the idea behind it?<br/><br/>2. You're more likely to get experience from talking than you are from getting into fights or gunplay. <br/><br/>Again, quirk of the system or deliberate design? If deliberate, why?<br/><br/>Thanks! <br/><br/>(I've only played Dogs once so far, and I'm getting ready for a more serious game, a prospect I'm pretty excited about.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176856/#Comment_176856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T07:32:29+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  7:32AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'd tap all your stat dice if you escalated from, say fighting to talking or from physical to gunfighting.

I find that "rewarding" talking with more experience encourages two things:<br/><br/>1) Players start out talking more often but inevitably end up escalating to violence. Without the encouragement to talk, players might just start out with their guns.<br/><br/>2) Players are encouraged to take tons of Fallout while talking. They grin like they're getting away with something by taking 6d4 Fallout in the early stage of a conflict, before they start escalating to shooting in the face. The Fallout ensures that characters change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176859/#Comment_176859" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T07:52:14+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  7:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>You're more likely to get experience from talking than you are from getting into fights or gunplay.</blockquote>\nThe way I look at it, you're more likely to get experience not from talking, but from doing <i>poorly</i> in the "just talking"  stage: so the game in a way encourages to start off trying to resolve your problems peacefully, fail horribly, and then escalate to violence to get your way, in order to achieve both your side of the stakes <i>and</i> some fallout experience.<br/><br/>Which I personally think is a kind of awesome little emergent aspect of the system that I never noticed spelled out anywhere in the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176860/#Comment_176860" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T07:58:34+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  7:58AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!

It encourages people to talk first instead of going strait for violence which will almost always inevitably come. But talking fallout means taking the blow in talking conflicts. Taking the blow means selling your opponent's action. So if I say, "admit you are a sinner." And you take the blow with 6 dice for 6 talking fallout, you have to show how my words words affected you in a meaningful manner. Now that might mean the obvious and you admit you are a sinner. It also might mean that you become full of doubt, "maybe I am a sinner?" Talking fallout doesn't kill your character. But selling taking the blow in a talking conflict is insanely powerful. Admitting you are wrong? Changing your beliefs? Agreeing to actions you don't want to do? You decide how to sell it but these are no small consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have mixed feelings on escalating. It gives you more dice to stay in the game but your opponent also gets to escalate as well. It's a great way to hide dice. So if your opponent sees you have a bunch of crappy dice (all with a value of 3 or less), they may raise you with a low value, say a 1 and a 3 for a total of 4 which allows them to save their stronger dice but also protects them from you since you don't have any single results that can see that raise with only 1 die, thus reversing the blow. BUT if you escalate, you may end up with dice that can indeed reverse the blow, giving you a huge advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people I know do not like this, but I do! I like using <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lumpley.com/afraid-resolution.html" rel="nofollow">the Escalate rules from Afraid (horror version of the Dogs rules)</a>. When you escalate, not only do you get to roll more dice but you get to ignore someone's Raise! It makes a huge difference and has led to some of my favorite roleplaying moments. Before, sometimes we would escalate, roll a few extra dice and depending on what we rolled it didn't have very much impact. But ignoring a Raise and then attacking right back... that's pretty sick and tends to sell the fiction better for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176893/#Comment_176893" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T11:37:45+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:37AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the answers. <br><br>John, that's some good stuff, and I really appreciate it.

Have stats<br/>Yes, I mean strength stamina willpower charisma education and savvy, or whatever combo your game calls for. Probably your game calls for some.<br/><br/>Know why? Because stats imply arenas of conflict, and they differentiate both a) the characters, in terms of which arenas of conflict they're fit for and b) the players, in terms of the details and wrangling of your reward rules.<br/><br/>Remember how important the fitness of a character is? Stats are a clean, easy and functional way to make fit characters.<br/><br/>But check this out, let's call it 1a:<br/><br/>1a. Make your stats tricky<br/>That is, don't name your stats after the arenas of conflict in your game - in fact, don't line them up 1:1 with the arenas of conflict in your game at all!<br/><br/>It probably doesn't make any difference to the fitness of the character, but it makes a huge difference to the details and wrangling of your reward rules for the player.<br/><br/>I'll offer Dogs in the Vineyard as an example. Here's my character:<br/>Acuity 3<br/>Body 2<br/>Heart 5<br/>Will 3<br/><br/>In terms of character fitness, is that functionally equivalent to these stats instead?<br/>Just Talking 8<br/>Physical 7<br/>Fighting 5<br/>Gunfighting 6<br/><br/>Yes, it sure is.<br/><br/>But see how much difference it makes to me, the player, to be manipulating my character's fitness in pairs instead of singly? I want to make my character a more fit fighter, for instance - so do I increase her Body, thereby also making her a more fit athelete, or her Will, thereby also making her a more fit gunfighter? Dogs' split stat makes its reward rules more interesting than they would be if I just slapped a +1 on my favorite way to win.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176908/#Comment_176908" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T12:17:10+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 12:17PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it also serves to underscore the decision to use guns.

Mathematics is not to sum total of design.  I don't think Sorcerer would be better served by giving demon's Need Points.  And as they use their Powers it costs them Need Points.  You can convert your own Humanity into Need Points by narrating some horrible thing you're doing to feed the demon.<br/><br/>Simply giving demons Needs and Desires and talking about how they serve the fiction *is* design.  If the group applies that design badly, that's a failure of the group, not the game.

Maybe you started out with guns, then escalated to talking. It happens. Suddenly, you want to go back to guns, but you see no mechanical benefit (you're not getting anymore dice, bub). What you're missing is the mechanical benefit of threatening Xd10 fallout. I've just pushed an 18 out there saying I'm shooting you in the head. You have no way of Seeing without Taking the Blow. Taking the Blow means you'll be rolling 3+ d10s, which stands a moderate chance of killing you outright. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs winning the stakes worth maybe dying?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the mechanical advantage of going to guns even when you don't get dice. If you can force them to Take the Blow, they may just give instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176918/#Comment_176918" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T13:40:46+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  1:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

The reason: duh! The other person can't just casually take the blow--so if they think the conflict isn't worth being badly hurt or dying over, they either have to give or burn higher dice when they block.<br/><br/>Of course this does depend on the mindset of the opposing character. If it's an NPC, you're really at the mercy of the GM in a way, because the dice ultimately don't tell you how effective this threat is. (I mean: yes, the available dice will determine how badly the NPC is constrained should they decide to stay in the conflict. But the dice don't provide any guidance on whether the NPC is of a mind to stay in even if they're going to have to take the blow against gunfire.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
