There are like a million Dogs threads here, and none of the thread titles lead me to believe that they're about twosie Dogs.<br/><br/>Could someone point me in the right direction, or ideally debrief their experiences regarding Dogs for two? I ask because I just spread out all my games that work for two people (or that I heard work) in front of my wife to see if she was interested in playing any of them. She picked Dogs and Apocalypse World; there's some talk of twosie-AW on its forum, but I can't find anything like that for Dogs.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282849/#Comment_282849" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-25T22:37:45+00:00" title="July 25, 2010 10:37PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see why Dogs for two wouldn't be just great!<br/><br/>I've run Towns for two people at a time, and they sometimes split up upon entering the Town and didn't interact with each other again after that. It went well!<br/><br/>You'll just have to watch out for two things, as far as I can see:<br/><br/>1. Overpowering the lone Dog. Stay away from things that give the NPCs more dice: groups/mobs, Sorcerers, and possessed people. I think the basic NPC dice will give the lone player plenty enough challenge. Don't go throwing in Sorcery dice and all that stuff, or it could get a little bleak.<br/><br/>2. Death! In Dogs, there is always the "safeguard" of a healing conflict to keep the characters from dying. With no one to administer healing, by the book a "dying" character is just dead, period. Consider how you're going to deal with this. Maybe "dying" just means the character has failed to save the Town? (Maybe they've fallen into a coma or a fever and carted off to heal somewhere, while the Town falls apart.) Or maybe you can bring in something like the death-saver options from Apocalypse World--the dying Dog survives, but must choose to be "shattered" (extra long-term fallout?), "disfigured", or something similar. Worth thinking about, anyway.<br/><br/>Also:<br/><br/>Find a way to get as much mileage as possible out of the Dog's relationships! Use them to build your Towns, create them together, whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282863/#Comment_282863" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T05:08:20+00:00" title="July 26, 2010  5:08AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run it that way quite a lot.

I had really complex feelings about the faith all through our six-town run. On the one hand, it was horrible and opressive for so many people, but on the other hand, it was this beautiful experiment doomed to be devoured by the encroaching industrialisation from the East. Our game finally came down to the question of whether the Faith was worth preserving, and whether the Faith should remain isolated or learn to adapt. As someone who is non/anti-religious, it was really interesting for me to feel this sympathy and even nostalgia for the Faith.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283172/#Comment_283172" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T17:34:22+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  5:34PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite></blockquote>\nThe situation?
