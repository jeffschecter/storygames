In the beginning it's always some loot since the characters are broke (R0). <br/><br/>Players write Beliefs about the loot. Then kick in the door and go. <br/><br/>Sometimes a player will point to something on the map and ask what's there. Others will suggest cool ideas based on the map. So roll with it.

While the resolution mechanics of BW can work for that, it still undermines what Beliefs are best at, and also what the extended character creation is for.<br/><br/>In BW, the GM is supposed to adapt game situations to challenge Beliefs. If players are just supposed to write Beliefs about stuff the GM has already written, and/or the GM doesn't adapt the situation to challenge their Beliefs, then what's the point in even using them? It's sub-optimal. Sure, you can get a <i>similar</i> aesthetic feeling from playing Thelon's Rift, but BW is a game that revolves around the characters, who they are and what they want, while the pre-built sandbox of the old-school revolves around the setting, and the game doesn't care who your characters are. For <i>that</i> kind of game, other games do a better job than BW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293400/#Comment_293400" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-14T19:11:43+00:00" title="September 14, 2010  7:11PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2010 5:08PM by Johnstone.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>"Burning Wheel and Sorcerer are flat-out wrong for the kind of game you're suggesting, Gregor"<br/><br/>Good for BW folks this statement is pretty easily disproved. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> see above</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>I totally agree.

I stand by what I said here and it's was not meant to be insulting or assy. Your comment related to BW as a sandobx so I posted the response here as to not further derail the thread. You are more then welcome to repost your whisper here. BW can be wrong for the type of play in your sandbox and even in the OP's sandbox. That is totally fine.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>That said.<br/><br/>I saw the OP's requirements too and thought BW along with other games as well. So this is a thread about sandbox play BW and it's potential problems.<br/><br/>You did point out one of the downfalls of a pre-built sandbox is that the player aren't engaged or can become disengaged. I guess what I run is a flexible sandbox. Lots of challenges set up before hand, hints of situation, and then we go. So it has all the requirements that the OP stated. <br/><br/>What can come up is someone sees something on the map and says "Cool I want that" and I as a GM have nothing. So I ask them to write a Belief and we go. <br/><br/>This style has worked but I don't know the long term (2+ yrs down the road) game looks like. I would guess it would evolve away from the sandbox play I describe. <br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293406/#Comment_293406" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-14T19:55:12+00:00" title="September 14, 2010  7:55PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>How does Burning Wheel, so intensely-focused on specific character Beliefs that must be challenged by the GM, work well with a "We'll see where we go today" style of play?</blockquote>\nThe short version (I know I'm going to end up cross-posting, because I started this awhile ago and am just now saving it) is that if the character Beliefs are about "where we go today" (or, more often, "what we do today"), it's totally sandbox.<br/><br/>The best example I can think of for this (besides the ones Judd will no doubt provide) would by KTNG, which was summarized in a series of about a dozen podcasts by the Podgecast guys.

I wish I knew Greyhawk better so that I could point out relevant bits.<br/><br/>That said, thinking about the Sword Coast of the Forgotten Realms, it is teeming with situation and my players looked it over and made characters that plugged into that.  No, we probably aren't engaging in orthodox sandboxery as you define it but in BW, I definitely don't tailor challenges based on the characters' abilities but more to what is supposed to be at place X.  That said, what is at place X is influenced by their beliefs and the consequences of their actions, in that order.

Every time (perhaps in the very session, or perhaps a few days before) the players decide "I want to go there!" or "I want to see what's that thing!". The GM need not have the whole map filled out, but he should have enough prepared dungeons, NPCs and locales that he's prepared for every eventuality of "going there". Everywhere you go there should be cool stuff to find and stuff to fight. So...<br/><br/>2) There should always be the feeling that the world is always bigger, that there is always something still left unexplored, something you missed. The world is NOT tailored to the PCs. There should be many times you have to run only to come back another day. Which brings me to...<br/><br/>3) There is no baked-in situation. The world is passive and uncaring. There can be certain countdowns and threats, for example "If no-one goes into the Dreadcrag caves for a month, the goblins move back in and fortify them." <br/><br/>4) "here's your playground, full of challenges I wonder what you're going to do about."</i><br/><br/>If that's okay I'll stick with these 4 points? I need some starting place for how you see the sandbox and if my sandbox looks like yours. At the moment I think it does.

Agenda is basically how we play, what we get our kicks out of during the game. Reading Burning THAC0, there's a lot of advice like:<br/>-forget about surprising your players, tell them what the module is about<br/>-throw out the filler, it has not place in BW<br/>-random encounters aren't really cool in BW<br/>-no gold and XP hunts, because you don't need them<br/>etc.<br/><br/>So, yeah, while BW can be used to give and oldschool feel, it's not really oldschool. Examples of hexcrawl agenda is stuff like "surprising your players" and "finding out what's at the bottom of the well". BW's RAW agenda is "challenge your player's beliefs" and "fight for your beliefs". You can make the two overlap, because of the flexibility of Beliefs but, it's just not the same "way to play". We agree on that, yeah? It's a matter of what you want out of your game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>I'll dig out my crappy notes and characters sheets from previous game and write stuff up.</blockquote>\nVery cool, thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293454/#Comment_293454" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T07:50:56+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  7:50AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite><br/>If that's okay I'll stick with these 4 points?<br/>---<br/>*A lot of the requirements you are talking about here are met with Daniel's engine discussed in this<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12918&amp;page=1#Item_37" rel="nofollow">thread</a></blockquote>\nCrossposted earlier.

Telling them what the module is about doesn't necessarily require telling them everything. At least not in my interpretation. What is does mean to me really is taking the advice in modules of old to how to hook the PCs in, and baking the hooks into the PC's beliefs. However, this works best if a bit more spirit of openness is used than in traditional old school play.<br/><br/>Filler was a pacing mechanism. To the extent that filler has relevance to the fiction, I think it's still reasonable to include it in a Burning Wheel game, however, it may be introduced as simple fiction without engagement of mechanics (other than "say yes" - which in a sense IS a mechanic).<br/><br/>Random encounters are just a specific form of filler, and as such, are a pacing mechanism. They work great in Burning Wheel as complications to failed rolls, or perhaps even particular choices by players (have a good reason to not "say yes"? perhaps one of the modules (if you're adapting an old school module) random encounters could be used to provide the obstacle for the resulting roll).<br/><br/>BW can gave gold and XP hunts, just write a belief about them. However, ultimately, they are just the reward mechanism of old school RPGs. Their relevance to the fiction is really limited to their role as rewards that drive play. I don't think the change in reward mechanisms between D&amp;D and BW really changes how a sandbox might be used.<br/><br/>To me, the ideal of sandbox play is that players engage the sandbox on the level of the fiction, and utilize the game mechanics to drive tension into the fiction.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293465/#Comment_293465" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T08:28:44+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  8:28AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Sandbox BW</b><br/><br/>I am not really sure of a good order to address this in since they all overlap.

On the large scale I have several 11x17 maps strung together. The maps evolve like Tony's How to Host a Dungeon.<br/><br/>1) Primordial physical geography is laid down<br/>2) This geography determines boundaries, interactions, and situations of tribes, kingdoms, city-states, what have you. These collapse and leave behind ruins altering the landscape.<br/>3) Environmental changes leave their marks on the landscape<br/>4) Repeat adding layers as you want<br/><br/>This can be done all at once. I just wrote it out stepwise. So what you have is an environmental narrative with situation built into the map. All maps that I like have this built in. I should clarify situation. This is not how it's typically used in BW. It's maybe more fluid. I don't really know how to describe it with words <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>The town is usually a small dot on the far east side of the map. So on the large scale there is always <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is typically what the player map looks like and this map evolves as the players push (through Beliefs) their characters out into the wilderness<br/><br/>I've done something similar to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> as well with just a few things jotted down and then a blank players map. It works both ways. Just depends on what you want <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>On the smaller scale each encounter (microdungeon) has special areas that are hard to get to based on the resources available to the characters. So every place has something that is unexplored.<br/><br/>With a rotating player bases different groups explore different areas of the map. This in turn makes the other groups go WTF I want to explore there or reexplore this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293469/#Comment_293469" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T08:43:06+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  8:43AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>4) "here's your playground, full of challenges I wonder what you're going to do about."</i><br/><br/>Several things tie into this.<br/><br/>First and most important everyone at the table is on the same page. <br/><br/>The pitch "Hey all I have this bad ass map full of challenges and not really a particular situation or story in mind. It's an explore and kick in the door kind of game. All Beliefs will be focused on that. Cool? " <br/>1) Bring the map to show off <br/>2) and the players map<br/>3) Highlight the challenges on the players map.

The Adventure Burner has good advice in it. <br/><br/>Second<br/>Lonely GM fun. Having already setup the map I have lots of challenges already to go. These aren't scaled to match character abilities. Usually I try and put easier challenges closer but not always.<br/><br/>Third<br/>Beliefs. Very important like in any BW game.

You wrote Beliefs for it, which by virtue of Beliefs, made it a Situation. You addressed it.<br/><br/>The way I understand the distinction:<br/><br/><b>BW:</b><br/>GM: "Ok, guys so there's this mountain pass called Devil's Arse that's been unguarded for a while and if nobody defends it it's going to be repopulated by goblins."<br/>Player 1: "Sweet." <br/>Player 2: "I know, my dude has a belief that says 'I must defend the mountain pass for it was the duty of my forefathers and so it shall be mine.'" <br/>Player 1: "Yeah, and I'll write 'If the pass falls, commerce with the east barony will fail and my family will go hungry'."<br/><br/><b>Oldschool Hexcrawl:</b><br/>GM: "What do you want to do today?"<br/>Player 1: "Oooh, let's travel to the Shattered Spire." Player 2: "Yes, let's!"<br/>GM: "Ok." Makes some notes about how travel to the Shattered Spire takes a week and advances his goblin countdown for the Devil's Arse.<br/><br/>Then, if this was BW, the GM would tell you what the Spire holds and the players would write Beliefs (like, there's a wizard in the spire that's terrorizing the countryside and the players would write "I must stop the wizard."). In a hexcrawl, the players would have no idea what's in the Spire or even what it is until they got there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But carry on, this is good stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293480/#Comment_293480" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T09:44:35+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  9:44AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya<br/><br/> Thanks for the clarification.

But it did allow for Beginner's Luck on skills, Advancement testing, Resource testing, and a failed Circle roll.

Once you have that settled, have everyone write a big picture belief that ties into that, a reason why they are exploring. Is it ideological? Is it for gain or glory? Something that provides a context for the characters to be exploring and adventuring. This may not be true hexcrawling. <br/><br/>Then have everyone write a belief about the group or another PC and that should tie everyone together nicely. <br/><br/>Then for the third, leave that one open for now and let the players add that in as they get invested or identify things they want to do based on the stuff they have found or encounter. So instead of them creating situation by writing beliefs, the GM provides it at each location and then the players write a belief in response to it about what they want to do about it. <br/><br/>So using the example of the Shattered Spire, the players get there I check my map and notes and see I have stuff about a Goblin horde setting up shop, so I immediately get into setting that up and describing what the players find while threatening or challenging the characters big picture beliefs, for example say a Knight with a belief of "I will protect the people of the Marches by defeating the evil we find" by pointing out the siege equipment they are building for an attack on the keep or whatever. My notes also mention and evil Goblin Shaman, which the knight see ordering the construction of some shrine as well. He is all then "my 3rd belief is - I must destroy the profane Goblin shrine, it is an affront to my god" or maybe "I will defeat Shaman and thus break the horde". And then we are off to the races.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293500/#Comment_293500" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T11:46:33+00:00" title="September 15, 2010 11:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2010 11:51AM by Teataine.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>Make sense?</blockquote>\nYeah, totally. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>You're just using Beliefs in a specific way (short-term, session-by-session) to give you a certain kind of play.

Maybe there should be even just two beliefs (interpersonal and ethical) and the main one should be renamed to "Goal" or something. <br/><br/>I'm still cautious about the whole issue. I did consider it was possible to run BW in sandbox mode, and this thread has cemented that, obviously, yes, it can. But...you get something that's fun and sandboxy, that's <i>like</i> the traditional sandbox, but ultimately, I think I must concur with Johnstone where he says:\n<blockquote>but BW is a game that revolves around the characters, who they are and what they want, while the pre-built sandbox of the old-school revolves around the setting, and the game doesn't care who your characters are. For that kind of game, other games do a better job than BW.</blockquote>\nLet me emphasize that this is not to say you can't do sandbox with BW or that it's not fun, it's just a different kind of sandbox than the truly purist oldschool hexcrawl.<br/><br/>Thank you Ara for all the extensive notes.

Here: <a href="http://podgecast.com/archives/tag/ktng/page/2" rel="nofollow">http://podgecast.com/archives/tag/ktng/page/2</a><br/>And here: <a href="http://podgecast.com/archives/tag/ktng" rel="nofollow">http://podgecast.com/archives/tag/ktng</a><br/><br/>(You start on page two, cuz they're posted in reverse chrono order. It's worth noting that in this game, the 'sandbox premise' was that everyone was noble sons of a noble house, and the players pointed everything at doing politics and stuff, so that's pretty much what they ended up doing. It's a lot less dungeon crawl and a lot more Reign.)<br/><br/>However, there's still lots you can do in "go explore mode" and still tie it into beliefs. If you show your players the map and they say "this 'Castle Tenebrous' sounds cool", then they write beliefs around it.<br/><br/>Or, more accurately, tailor the second half (the 'goal' half) of their beliefs to it.<br/><br/>So maybe I have:<br/><br/>Beliefs:<br/>1. I must clear my name and regain my ancestral lands.<br/>2. I will help my friend Sandroval regain his place in Dwarven society .<br/>3. When I next face my brother, I will defeat him expose him as the betrayer he is.<br/><br/>So the Castle Tenebrous is coming up as our next thing, so I revise my beliefs to:<br/><br/>Beliefs:<br/>1. I must clear my name and regain my ancestral lands; the Library Tenebrous has geneological records I require.<br/>2. I will help my friend Sandroval regain his place in Dwarven society; I will help him take the great axe Zigilburk back from the Champion of the Castle Tenebrous.<br/>3. When I next face my brother, I will defeat him and expose him as the betrayer he is; to do this, I must improve my swordplay.<br/><br/>There. Now all my beliefs give me something specific to do for this stretch of the campaign, regardless of whether we're on the way there (practice swordplay or plan with Sandroval), or exploring the castle itself. ("What do you MEAN there's no library?")<br/><br/>As the GM, the nice thing about this is that, once the player's Beliefs are updated, I know exactly what I need to prep for the next couple sessions (and, unless I had something additional in mind, that's pretty much ALL I have to prep).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293631/#Comment_293631" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T12:46:59+00:00" title="September 16, 2010 12:46PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><br/>This thread has been very informative.

Agenda is basically how we play, what we get our kicks out of during the game. Reading Burning THAC0, there's a lot of advice like:<br/>-forget about surprising your players, tell them what the module is about<br/>-throw out the filler, it has not place in BW<br/>-random encounters aren't really cool in BW<br/>-no gold and XP hunts, because you don't need them<br/>etc.<br/><br/>So, yeah, while BW can be used to give and oldschool feel, it's not really oldschool. Examples of hexcrawl agenda is stuff like "surprising your players" and "finding out what's at the bottom of the well". BW's RAW agenda is "challenge your player's beliefs" and "fight for your beliefs". You can make the two overlap, because of the flexibility of Beliefs but, it's just not the same "way to play". We agree on that, yeah? It's a matter of what you want out of your game.<br/><br/><br/>Gregor, before this thread gets closed out, I just wanted to respond to the comments on my Burning THAC0 advice briefly:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>-forget about surprising your players, tell them what the module is about.</blockquote>\nDon't interpret this too broadly. Here's what I wrote way back in 2006:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor</cite>First things first: I recommend discarding any of the old notions that the players should be completely surprised by what's coming. Show the players the cover of the module you're running. Read them the back cover blurb. If it has an intro section, consider reading that to them.<br/><br/>You don't have to reveal every twist and secret: just give them a broad overview. In other word, if the module is about delving into the Lost Temple of Whatsit to reover the Orb of Destiny that was stolen by Whosit during the reign of Thatguy, etc., tell the players! Then all of them should write at least one belief that takes them on the quest.</blockquote>\nIt's not about revealing all secrets. It's great for GMs to use secrets and allow for big reveals in all sorts of BW play.<br/><br/>Anyway, two points: 1. That (and most of the early Burning THAC0 advice) was specifically about playing from modules, which we did a lot of in our early Burning THAC0 play but don't really do much anymore; and 2. I don't think that was quite fair to some of the excellent old modules that actually did exactly what I recommend.<br/><br/>For example, here is the intro text that you are told to read to the players from The Keep on the Borderlands, one of the most well-loved early sandbox modules:\n<blockquote><cite>Written By: Gary Gygax</cite>The Realm of mankind is narrow and constricted. Always the forces of Chaos press upon its borders, seeking to enslave its populace, rape its riches, and steal its treasures. If it were not for a stout few, many in the Realm would indeed fall prey to the evil which surrounds them. Yet, there are always certain exceptional and brave members of humanity, as well as similar individuals among its allies\u2014dwarves, elves, and Halflings\u2014who rise above the common level and join battle to stave off the darkness which would otherwise overwhelm the land. Bold adventurers from the Realm set off for the Borderlands to seek their fortune. It is these adventurers who, provided they survive the challenge, carry the battle to the enemy. Such adventurers meet the forces of Chaos in a testing ground where only the fittest will return to relate the tale. Here, these individuals will become skilled in their profession, be it fighter or magic-user, cleric or thief. They will be tried in the fire of combat, those who return, hardened and more fit. True, some few who do survive the process will turn from Law and good and serve the masters of Chaos, but most will remain faithful and ready to fight chaos wherever it threatens to infect the Realm.<br/><br/>You are indeed members of that exceptional class, adventurers who have journeyed to the <b>Keep on the Borderlands</b> in search of fame and fortune. Of course you are inexperienced, but you have your skills and a heart that cries out for adventure. You have it in you to become great, but you must gain experience and knowledge and greater skill. There is much to learn, and you are willing and eager to be about it! Each of you has come with everything which could possibly be given you to help. Now you must fend for yourselves, your fate in you own hands, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Ahead, up the winding road, atop a sheer-walled mount of stone, looms the great KEEP. Here, at one of civilization's strongholds between good lands and bad, you will base yourselves and equip for forays against the wicked monsters who lurk in the wilds. Somewhere nearby, amidst the dark forests and tangled fens, are the <b>Caves of Chaos</b> where fell creatures lie in wait. All this you know, but before you dare adventure into such regions you must become acquainted with the other members of yur group, for each life will depend upon the ability of the others too cooperate against the common foe. Now, before you enter the grim fortress, is the time for introductions and an exchange of information, for fate seems to have decreed that you are to become and adventurous band who must pass through many harrowing experiences together on the path which leads toward greatness.</blockquote>\nThat right there is more than enough to fulfill my recommendation about not keeping secrets. Every player should be able to write at least two beliefs based upon that. If I were GMing this, I would tell the players:<br/><br/>1.\tWrite a Belief about why you came to the Keep or what you hope to accomplish in the Caves of Chaos.<br/>2.\tWrite a Belief about another PC or one of your Relationships (which I should be able to merge with the NPCs listed in the module, as they don't have names anyway).<br/><br/>Most players could actually write a third Belief here without too much trouble, but I would recommend to my players that they hold off until they've had a chance to enter the Keep and talk to the NPCs. Why? Because there's a great little Rumor Table in Keep on the Borderlands, and many of the rumors are a Belief in waiting. If a rumor interests you, write a Belief about it!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Throw out filler, it has not place in BW</blockquote>\nI'm not sure how "filler" is integral to sandbox play. You don't have to fill every room with monsters in order to wear down the group's resources. There should only be a monster or other NPC in a room because it makes sense. Again, that advice is very specific to running Burning THAC0 from modules.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>Random encounters aren't really cool in BW</blockquote>\nHere's what I said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor</cite>Random encounters. They're a big thing in D&amp;D. Or at least they used to be when I played. But they don't really fit in Burning Wheel that well. Ignore filler, remember?<br/><br/>At the same time they really contribute to the D&amp;D feel. So here's my suggestion: Use encounters as the consequences for failed tests. Remember that failed tests in Burning Wheel are an opportunity for the GM to add complications. Make use of them!</blockquote>\nSo that's not really a prohibition against random encounters. You just don't use them the same way you did in D&amp;D. Instead of rolling randomly every few hours of game time, you wait until the players fail an Orienteering, Hunting, Survival, Cooking, or similar test (Forte test to stay awake!). When I ran from modules, I'd turn to that random encounter chart the moment the players failed a test like that and choose something fun from it. No reason you couldn't roll on a table if that makes it feel more authentic.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>No gold and XP hunts, because you don't need them</blockquote>\nThat's not <i>quite</i> right. Here's what I said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor</cite>One thing we learned early on: You don't need to give every monster and encounter a handful of treasure with which to reward the players.<br/><br/>It's fine to have the color of breaking open chests of gold or looting corpses for a few copper pieces. But either way, you can get away with awarding a handful of Resources advantage dice when the characters emerge from the dungeon (or whatever).<br/><br/>3D to 5D of cash on hand, shared by the group, is a significant reward!</blockquote>\nSo it's not so much that you can't go on a gold hunt. It's just that handing out Resources dice after each encounter will quickly give characters far more wealth than even D&amp;D characters typically haul away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293643/#Comment_293643" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-16T13:44:38+00:00" title="September 16, 2010  1:44PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>I don't know if I am smart enough to talk about the varying agendas.

Same thing for deciding to destroy the Temple of Evil Chaos. <br/><br/>In BW, we just formalize the process a bit so that when you choose a goal like that, you change a Belief to reflect it and so you'll be rewarded for pursuing it. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not sure how our Burning THAC0 campaign would rate purity-wise on the sandbox scale, but it gives me the same feeling I used to get when exploring the Caves of Chaos or venturing forth from Hommlet to tackle the moathouse. <br/><br/>We've begun as lowly adventurers in Threshold, braved the depths of Castle Caldwell, fought dinosaurs in both the Lost Vale of Hutaaka and the Isle of Dread, uprooted the Veiled Society in Specularum, stopped the invasion plans of the Black Eagle Baron, stopped a plague of zombies in Verge, explored lost pyramids in the sandy deserts of Yalarum, put one of our own on the throne of Rockhome, and stopped the plots of Shadow Elves in Alfheim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293764/#Comment_293764" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T10:16:09+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 10:16AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor, your observations are really interesting to me. On the surface, my early D&amp;D play strongly resembled the bit Johnstone referenced from the Red Box Vancouver blog, but I think what really grabbed me about D&amp;D was the character narative, weak as the mechanical support for that was. One of my strongest memories about my longest running AD&amp;D campaign is two characters who were brothers (as opposed to the two players who were brothers...), Haldo and Zilto. I also remember coming up with an adventure to let the PCs clear off an island for one of the players character's to build a stronghold on and then being pissed off at the player for bailing on the session.<br/><br/>It has always struck me that Burning Wheel evolved from the mode of D&amp;D play Thor talks about, giving mechanical weight to the types of player contribution that make this sort of play so much fun. When I look back on where the fun was in my past gaming, it always includes strong player contribution, yet with a strong GM role in providing the framework. Perhaps this style isn't meant by those who originated the sandbox term, but it's what I associate with sandbox, and as such, Burning Wheel strikes me as an ideal game for that style of play.<br/><br/>Sadly, my recent experience (prior to the Burning Wheel group that I have just pulled together) has been more like what Johnstone suggests, with little player contribution (except a few notable times when players tried to force their contributions). It made me start to despair getting to that strong player contribution in a GM framed setting that I so enjoy. Seeking Burning Wheel players looks like it has finally provided me a way to hook up with such players.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293839/#Comment_293839" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T17:53:57+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  5:53PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ara, sorry for getting all mad and shit.

That's interesting. So, the DM has a map of a dungeon all plotted out and stocked with some random tables. Once the Dm has a few of these, he can pull out a hex map and plot out some wilderness, and place the dungeons on the map, and towns and other locations, and then grabs a bunch of random tables. So the wilderness map is really the same as a dungeon map, just with fewer walls. PCs can go anywhere they want inside a dungeon, just like they can go anywhere they want out in the wilderness.<br/><br/>The difference is that with wilderness exploration, you're trying to avoid monsters in order to find dungeons, while in the dungeons, you're trying to avoid monsters in order to find treasure, which you use to level up. It's like another level of a dungeon -- a meta-level of the dungeon. It's still supposed to be "foreign territory" for the PCs.<br/><br/>And of course the other difference is that because the two levels are differentiated, players treat them differently. Like your group did player narration and character back-story in the "wilderness" section, and then, I guess pure problem-solving play once you got into the dungeons?<br/>(I'm imagining you guys in the wilderness pondering stuff like "how can I get the princess to fall in love with me?" and "how can I get revenge on the duke?" and "my character has a flowing purple cape his mother made for him!" and then when you get into the dungeon it's all "how can we find the treasure?" and "how can we get out alive?" and "I've got the iron spikes, who brought the hammer?")<br/><br/>Of course, if the DM has the whole hex map prepped, and all the dungeons on it are complete, and the PCs can wander around exploring it, that's the old-school sandbox style. It's a fuck of a lot of work, too. A DM might be tempted to switch to a method that requires less pre-play work, but that also might necessitate a change in play style, too.<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D-style, play goes like this:<br/>DM (looks down at his notes): Okay, you see some stuff. And some other stuff happens. And that's what's there. What do you do?<br/>Player (improvising): Oh, well I do this, and this, and this other thing.<br/><br/>In Burning Wheel, play goes more like this:<br/>Player (looks down at his notes): Okay, I do this, and this, and this other thing. What happens?<br/>GM (improvising): Oh, well you see some stuff, and some other stuff happens.<br/><br/>Or, more simply, D&amp;D is where the players improvise based on what the DM has already thought up (a dungeon), and Burning Wheel is where the GM improvises based on what the players have already thought up (characters). If you try playing D&amp;D in a BW style, you don't have enough of a character (at 1st level) for the DM to come up with challenging situations. If you play BW in an old-school D&amp;D style, you don't get much out of the Beliefs-Artha-Advancement cycle, because the GM isn't improvising based on the players.<br/><br/>(This is also just one way of comparing them. I wrote another post about how detailed characters in games that run like D&amp;D annoy me, and why they're better in BW.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293851/#Comment_293851" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T20:30:42+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  8:30PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ah ha.

The slavers have been marauding up and down the coast, taking slaves and selling them from their fort in the hills.<br/><br/>Player: I'd like to play a good ole fashioned mercenary, hired to take out the slave lords by local lords.<br/><br/>Player 2: I was thinking of playing a local lord, actually.  Can I be the guy who hired you?<br/><br/>Player: Sure.<br/><br/>Player 3: I'm a local hunter who has begged on to the group that is hunting the slavers because my wife and children were taken while I was away on the hunt.<br/><br/>GM: Sounds like we have a game.  We will begin the game with you in sight of their fort, where they chain up the slaves they have taken locally in order to sell them.<br/><br/>The GM can have maps, and slave lords burned up, ready to roll and the players have to link their beliefs and relationships to that pre-made stuff.  World burning doesn't need to be a democratic hug-fest.<br/><br/>There is a lot of room for world burning in an adventure the GM has in the can, ready to roll. In the example above, the player who burns up the local lord could take the place of an NPC Lord in the module or that NPC could become a part of a web of lords who rule the area on the coast.  That player's relationships, reputations and affiliations are going to define a whole lot about the nobles of that area.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293874/#Comment_293874" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-18T10:00:09+00:00" title="September 18, 2010 10:00AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2010 10:10AM by Teataine.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>World burning doesn't need to be a democratic hug-fest.<br/>[...] <br/>That player's relationships, reputations and affiliations are going to define a whole lot about the nobles of that area.</blockquote>\nThose two don't seem completely compatible to me? The player obviously has a huge swag of power over what the NPCs are like, what the world is like, etc.<br/><br/>Even if the GM comes to the table with a prepared <i>world</i>, the players are going to write beliefs based on that and infuse the world with situation. It's going to be the players and their characters that define the world and shape play. The GM must be addressing the players' Beliefs or the game will fail, no?<br/><br/>But anyway, this is all about pre-play. I think the crux of Johnstone's post is talking about play. <br/>In BW the players (pro-)act based on their beliefs, maybe roll some dice, GM responds, improvises complications for failed rolls. <br/>In D&amp;D the players wait for input from the GM, communicating his prep, and then respond, the results of their actions are often covered by prep.                        </div>\n<div

Because I'm not contradicting your experience (in my mind, I'm not, we'll see how the words work out). I'm trying to point out the differences in the two styles of play, not describe what BW play is like in it's totality.<br/><br/>I agree that a BW GM can have a whole map plotted out and all sorts of stuff, and have a dominant role in shaping the campaign. I'm talking more about play than campaign setup though.<br/><br/>How's this: Would you play a Burning Wheel game where the GM did NOT react to the player characters' Beliefs, Instincts, Traits, and Relationships, did not read them, did not introduce situations to challenge them, and did not change his DM prep to account for who the player characters are?

It would be very challenging, to see if I really believed what I said I believed in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way I felt like I've done that in a game I played a year and a half ago.  I came into a BW game that was a couple sessions into it already; the other PCs were two elves, the situation very much about their Beliefs.  I made a human and picked my Beliefs based on the things in the setting that interested me.  It didn't seem like the DM was pushing at those Beliefs, but that was okay with me, since I figured it was my responsibility to fight for what I believed in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I chose Beliefs that were tied to the Situation, the DM didn't need to push at them - he just needed to have the NPCs respond to my actions, and I needed to respond to the actions of the other PCs.  It worked well, and the fact that the game worked like that fed into the theme of the game.  (Do the elite have the right to make decisions for others?)<br/>\n<br/>\nVery interesting game.

And why or why not?"</i><br><br>This is kinda of what I was trying to explain above in how I layout a sandbox game. I hadn't thought about using BW terms to to describe it. And I can't speak for Judd. <br><br>I do read the BITs but all the BITs are geared toward exploration and what's already on the map. As for the Ts (as with the BIs) I make my expectations to the players very clear at the beginning during the world burning. By world burning here I mean I plunk down the map with all kinds of cool stuff on it. I then say create your characters with BITs based on what's on the map, exploring the area and then bring it.<br><br>During play the environment that is already set will challenge all the BIT's. My main job as the GM is to personify the environment so all those imagined challenges become Tests for Advancement, hard choices for the players, and so on. So as the GM I don't change the world or setting because all the BITs are already geared toward the map. This might fly in the face of the advice of democratic hugging world burning (I play this way too) but it sits just right in the GM role as given the BWR FRS book (errr pg. 64 I think). <br/><br/>I think this places a much heavier burden on the GM if you are starting from scratch like Johnstone mentioned above.

It's supposed to feel like an entity in-and-of itself, not something the DM and players make up as they go along. For players who want to explore a world, this gives them a sense of the settings reality, and for players who want a challenge or competitive play, it gives the sense that the odds are set at the beginning and don't change during play.<br/><br/>D&amp;D gives the DM plenty of tools to support that kind of play, like random tables. Wandering monster tables, reaction checks, treasure tables, etc. mean that encounters and events can be completely randomized, so the DM only has to make decisions for fictional elements that are already in the setting. Any decisions about what the world is like (including making up the random charts) have already been made before play starts.<br/><br/>Players come into this setting as a blank slate. Old-school character creation gives you some dude with stats, some abilities, and some equipment. You don't get any background or history because that might conflict with the DM's pre-fabricated setting.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel has this a bit, in that it's best to stat out NPCs and not just make up their stats on the fly, and that once you've declared a major conflict, and you're using Duel of Wits (for example), you set up the framework first, then play it out with the dice and whatever happens happens.<br/><br/>But playing a pre-generated sandbox with BW is going to run into some problems:<br/><br/>a) How do you handle Circles and Wises tests? Of course there's a certain leeway for the DM to improvise on small details, but it's contrary to the spirit of the setting for even the DM to just introduce new elements, nevermind the players.<br/><br/>b) If the GM isn't responding to Beliefs (and Instincts, Traits and relationships), it's basically guesswork on the part of players as to whether they get any Artha or not, which disrupts the whole cycle, makes advancement more difficult, etc. D&amp;D already has an advancement system that works with the pre-fab sandbox: if you get treasure, you level up.<br/><br/>c) The conflict resolution in BW is meant to push the narrative forward, so that the story is alays moving and always exciting. The pre-fab sandbox is pretty explicitly Story After. It's about exploring an environment, not about creating any coherent narrative aside from the things that happen. It's made to move from location to location and action to action, not from conflict to conflict.<br/><br/>And of course it doesn't have the stuff I mentioned above, the random tables or the cypher player characters, because why would it? BW's supposed to be played differently. When you want to know what to do next in the pre-fab sandbox, you ask the DM to describe the environment or you look at the map. In BW, you check your character sheet and your BITRs (that's the player notes I mentioned).<br/><br/>Of course, the sandbox I've described is something of a Platonic ideal and lots of people are playing versions of it, with one or the other aspect of it drifted and modified. Or they're playing something that looks similar on the outside but is really a totally different dynamic at the atomic level. The more you drift from the ideal, the more easily you'll be able to use BW for it, and obviously there's people playing Bw with different aspects of the sandbox, some with more, some with less. I'm not saying it can't be done or anything, I'm just pointing out how useful, or not, I think certain tools are for certain play styles.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think that's mostly all I have to say. Hopefully, y'all now understand why I told Gregor Burning Wheel was the wrong fit for a pre-fabricated sandbox campaign. Thanks for reading, hope I wasn't too boring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294238/#Comment_294238" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T03:14:57+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  3:14AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2010 3:15AM by Teataine.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to post this (from the Rules Cyclopedia), as a supplement to the thread.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/4254/daylistrulescyclopedia.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294248/#Comment_294248" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T06:31:27+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  6:31AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not boring at all Johnstone.

You can use Wises to uncover details that the GM has established. They can be used just like a knowledge skill in later versions of D&amp;D. Anyway, I don't see using wises to generate details (or cause the GM to improvise details) that haven't been pregenerated as impinging on sandbox play. Improvising when players push into areas you haven't detailed yet is not uncommon when it comes to sandboxes, from what I can tell. Certainly in the early modules, the GM is expected to add many details, presumably on the fly. As long as those details get recorded in notes and stay consistent upon one's next visit, that seems totally within the spirit of a sandbox. <br/><br/>As for Circles, the GM is totally within his rights to bring in NPCs that he has in his notes when players want to make a Circles test. <br/><br/>If the player wants a "Farmer who knows something about what's going on," I can look in my notes for potential candidates, choosing one for a successful test. If I'm certain there are no farmers that fit the bill, I can explain that's not a valid intent in this case and suggest something else.<br/><br/>Few of the people of the Keep on the Borderlands are named, and even many of the characters in The Village of Hommlet are listed as "farmer" or "militiaman."<br/><br/>B. The players write Beliefs based on what they're currently focused on in the  sandbox. If they hear about captives held in the Caves of Chaos and decide to rescue them, or decide to determine the truth of the legend of the haunted house above Saltmarsh, they write Beliefs about it and off you go. Just like in any other Burning Wheel play, you choose a direction and write Beliefs about it. You do this in Mouse Guard every session when you write your Goal for the mission. Mouse Guard is more structured, so the GM gets to set the missions. Burning THAC0 is much more open, allowing the players much more latitude in setting the agenda for the evening. <br/><br/>The current incarnation of D&amp;D has followed a similar tack with it's major quests and minor quests.<br/><br/>C. Exploration, whether of setting or something else, is a feature of all roleplaying games. While it will certainly alter your experience of the game, I don't think there's anything fundamental about story after as opposed to story now when it comes to a sandbox game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294256/#Comment_294256" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T07:18:50+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  7:18AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Thor, I don't see anything in Johnstone's description that really couldn't be worked in Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure very many, if any, GM's have a pre-defined campaign setting that is so detailed that wises and circles adding to the setting would be problematical. As the Adventure Burner makes clear, saying "no" because the GM has already established something in his notes is actually saying "yes." And players have always been able to improvise elements into the setting, starting with their PC, or if not that, the first time someone says "I look for a loose rock to pick up and throw."<br/><br/>As to Burning Wheel promoting proactive driving action on the part of the GM, that's really just advise to the GM to always push play. If players are at a loss as to what next, the GM should start pushing buttons, and that really applies to any RPG. Certainly some groups allow the game to stall, all that Burning Wheel does is explain the GM's role better in this aspect, and provides some a few game mechanics that help this.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294293/#Comment_294293" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T11:17:46+00:00" title="September 22, 2010 11:17AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor, Frank, you guys are still arguing in favour of BW because it's a good game, not because it's particularly well-suited to the pre-fabricated sandbox style I described. I outlined the play style I was recommending a game for, you're both arguing that style should be drifted so you can play BW with it. I'm not recommending a game for the sandbox style you have in your heads, but for the one I described upthread. I'm also not arguing that you <i>can't</i> use BW, I'm arguing that it's sub-optimal. If you love the BW mechanics way more than D&amp;D, of course it's still worth it. I realize not many people are strictly playing the ideal I described, and if you want to switch topics and move back to how you can best play BW using elements of the sandbox style, I'm happy to tell people to play BW. I love BW, but I would never want to play it with the style I described.<br/><br/>Good point about Wises and Circles, though.<br/><br/>To elaborate on the point about easy character creation: One thing that BW IS particularly unsuited for is rapid character death. This isn't a mandatory feature of the pre-fab sandbox (which is why I didn't make it a big point), but it is rather common. When I run B/X, I'm not killing too many PCs, but I've lost about one PC per game playing on <a href="http://planetalgol.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Planet Algol.</a> Any game with complicated character generation is bad for high-death-rate games unless you're a masochist, or you use pre-gen characters all the time. If my D&amp;D games were BW games, we'd have run out of pre-gens before now, and we'd be stuck re-using them or making new ones. And only ever using pre-gens is <i>definitely</i> using BW sub-optimally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294296/#Comment_294296" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T11:40:46+00:00" title="September 22, 2010 11:40AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2010 11:45AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way "sandbox" is being used by its advocates in this thread doesn't resemble how anyone I know has ever defined it (big, open-world, exploration-focused game), and as the thread progresses is sounding more and more like "D&amp;D" than "sandbox."<br/><br/>And of course it's easier to play D&amp;D with D&amp;D than with BW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294302/#Comment_294302" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T13:03:46+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  1:03PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Bret,<br/><br/>  In our BW games it is <i>big, open-world, exploration-focused game</i> with most of the focus on exploration.

We started in a small village and have since explored the swamp nearby, a local faerie market, and my character has been invited to join the imperial engineers and go travelling with them. It has totally been a sandbox game, and at no point have I felt that we've been fighting the system. Our character's Beliefs aren't invented out of thin air.

What are the DM and players making up then? Where is the creativity? I'm not sure you meant that. It's also interesting to contrast this to the comparison that was brought up earlier to kids playing in a pile of sand (perhaps that was in the other thread).<br/><br/>To me, even the most detailed of settings requires the GM and players to invent stuff as they go. This is the fun of RPG, D&amp;D, Burning Wheel, or anything else. Ultimately what distinguishes anything goes, everything is invented on the spur of the moment and the most rail-roady-pre-plotted campaign ever is just the degree of invention that is possible.<br/><br/>I agree with Bret that it seems that sandbox is being defined so that only one game system (or style of game system) fits it, not defining a concrete useful construct, and then evaluating how that construct might be used with different game systems.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best way to evaluate what game systems might support the style of play you are seeking is to define the style of play without using shortcut terms like "sandbox" that may not have universal definitions.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294323/#Comment_294323" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T14:32:23+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  2:32PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel H.</cite>Play that is heavy on--for lack of a better word--illusionism would go against what you\u2019re describing here.

The players don't introduce any fictional elements (aside from creating a mostly-cypher character).
