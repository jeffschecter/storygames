That.<br/><br/>I haven't posted here much if at all, so a fine "Howdy!" from south-central Indiana - the heart of limestone country!<br/><br/>So I'm digging Microscope. Kind of a lot. Finally ran it with a new-cobbled-together/reunited group of gamers, and we all liked it a lot. We also all agreed we wanted to see if it would work to re-write an existing pop-sulture setting. I will not say which one, because I don't want to get into opinions on the setting. Also, in the spirit of Microscope, I don't want other people's ideas about the setting. Suffice to say it is one very well-known to our new group.<br/><br/>SO....<br/><br/>I'm fishing around for ideas about how, if at all, one might tweak Microscope to accommodate this approach. I think it can work, and may need no tweaking at all in the hands of an agreeable, amiable group (which I seem to have assembled). But I'd love to hear your thoughts.<br/><br/>With that, I beseech thee: opine!<br/><br/>(Oh, and here's what we came up with in our first Microscope session: <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1XALzRhFnF0LVDS7MquVPWHF-cydADlsxaqk5eVZGPus/edit?authkey=CMfDzqYM&amp;hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">Fun!</a>)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332209/#Comment_332209" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T05:44:38+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  5:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2011 5:44AM by Ry.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>If I were doing this, I'd be focused on making a good Premise and Palette document that everybody was into before play.</p>\n<p>If there was a THING that people decided was crucial to the setting, I'd give it a period and event card at the start of play (in addition to the bookends).

I like it.<br/><br/>I think if everyone is sitting down at the table with the same idea ("let's redo Star Wars" or whatever, because who wouldn't want to reboot Star Wars), you should be able to just follow the normal Microscope rules and it should work. All the procedures of history setup are about getting everyone on the same page. If, like in Ry's example, there's something you absolutely want, then you just make it yourself when it's your turn.<br/><br/>I suspect the Palette will be the critical bit, because that's when you'll decide as a group precisely what elements of the setting you want to keep or throw out. If your vision of your perfect Star Wars reboot (or whatever) doesn't match, here's where you'll find out and/or work it out -- which is precisely what the Palette is for.<br/><br/>Once you've agreed on a Palette that says something like No Midichlorians, No cloned stormtroopers, No Sith race, Yes force ghosts, No casual force powers, Yes spirituality, Yes human-centric Republic, No all emotions = Dark Side, No omnipotent lightsabers\u2026 well you've already decided a ton about your new/retro Star Wars.<br/><br/>Oh, and No Gungans.

I'll post a report on the results. We'll start the session by discussing how much of the original trilogy will be our canon, and this will segue naturally into our Palette. I don't think we'll have start and end points, but rather a couple-few events that we all agree must happen. Not sure. Maybe start and end points still make sense.<br/><br/>Opinions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333431/#Comment_333431" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-06T22:36:00+00:00" title="July  6, 2011 10:36PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Star Wars really is the perfect target.
