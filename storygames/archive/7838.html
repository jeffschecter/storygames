Taken to the extreme the game becomes like a computer game or chess.<br/>\n- <b>narrativist/story based approach</b>: the aim is to create/experience interesting stories. Taken to the extreme, it becomes collaborative fiction creation.<br/>\n- <b>simulationist approach</b>: the aim is "immersion", feel/experience what the PC is supposed to feel/experience. Taken to the extreme it should become a second life?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll games contain elements of these three poles (often with a randomizing engine to add uncertainty), but according to GNS thinking it is not possible to satisfy a group of players interested in different approaches but playing the same game (hence the utility of a social contract).<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize this sketch is very rough and probably full of mistakes, but lets move to the point that interests me: I think I pretty much understand how the game system can support a gamist or a narrativist agenda. The gamist agenda is well supported by a clearly defined set of rules that provide interesting tactical choices for the players (think of chess or various computer games). I also think I see how the system can support a story/narrativist agenda: it should provide means to manipulate elements of the narrative structure (bangs, stakes, kickers, keys, outcomes, etc) to facilitate/improve shared story building.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What I don't understand is how a system can support the sim agenda</b>. I realize that many games set out to do just that, but in fact end up serving one of the other agendas. That does not prevent you from having the "immersive" feeling, but it's purely accidental. Two examples from personal history:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 - When I was a kid I loved to play Civilization. Although I realized that it was pure number crunching and that there was no ghost in the shell, I liked to feel myself like a potentate who is outraged by the backstabbing of other leaders. I would take revenge on the Chinese who failed to honor a peace treaty and go at lengths to destroy them even though the French where more of a strategic threat, simply because they had not attacked me. This way of playing was much less efficient but personally also more enjoyable, since I was emotionally invested or at least felt some meaning in doing what I was doing, instead of just winning the game. So even in a purely gamist game (a boardgame, really), I could feel some kind of immersion (I am the leader, and I have my reasons to do what I set out to do)<br/>\n<br/>\n2 - At some point in the nineties I played a short written story where the reader is the hero and must jump from paragraph to paragraph according to his choices to push the story forward. The theme was about a guy who comes to realize that he has become a vampire. I was incredibly struck by the idea of understanding that you crave for blood and need it to survive, and that you are becoming something profoundly unhuman (yep, vampire stories are great metaphors for teenager troubles). Again I don't think that the game system was particularly suited for a sim agenda. I would not choose a paragraph based on what would give the character more chances of survival (gamist), or create a more interesting story (narrativist), I simply tried to think about what I would do if I was that character, and then pick up the choice which came closest to it. I wanted to be that guy and feel his angst.<br/>\n<br/>\nEncouraged by the experience I tried to play Vampire the Requiem, but it was a disaster. I was totally uninterested in combat/intrigues/powers, I just wanted to experience how you would feel to have your identity irreversibly changed without your control, and could not do that with that game system (or at least with the gaming group I was in, or both).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my point is that I see games serving a gamist or a narrativist agenda (with skills/powers sets, life points, etc for the former, and narrative flow tools for the latter). But <b>are there systems or tools that really serve the sim agenda and improve your immersive feeling?</b> From what I gather the only good tool for that is providing a coherent setting that somehow facilitates suspension of disbelief, and a challenge that forces a reaction from the PC so that you get things moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain sorry if this is old for you but I would like some clear input on this issue, if possible.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173578/#Comment_173578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T13:17:52+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  1:17PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Alex,<br><br>First, let me say that, unfortunately, your understanding of the Creative Agendas as defined by the Big Model is a little weak.  If you want to understand them better we can work on that but these days I prefer to shoot directly for what kind of experience the person is looking for and speak directly to that.<br><br>You speak of "immersion."  Immersion,historically, has been a problematic term.  In my experience Immersion is somewhat linked to Creative Agenda in that I find that when a person's preferred Creative Agenda is being met he will report it has having experienced Immersion.<br><br>So when YOU say "Immersion" can you talk a little more about what you mean?  This is the closest hint you give:<br><br>"I just wanted to experience how you would feel to have your identity irreversibly changed without your control."<br><br>Can you tell me what was interesting to you about that?  Did you really just want to 'experience' it?  Or was there something more to it?

However, it's proven very tricky to discuss online, which means a lot of people just want to shut down those conversations immediately.<br><br>I'm far from an expert on the Big Model, but the G/N/S part of it is probably my least favourite part, although I'm totally down with the concept of Creative Agenda as something that ties everything together into a great game. So, with that caveat, and realizing that someone more knowledgeable might (and should) step in to correct me at any moment:<br><br>It is going to be difficult to answer this question without unraveling a little more about what exactly it is you enjoy about the "immersive" feeling. The concept of feeling "immersed" is not actually strictly linked to the Simulationist agenda. It seems to refer to different things for different people, and is a very personal experience. <br/><br/>Rather, it seems to me that for individual players there are a number of play techniques which they find help them immerse, or prevent them from immersing. These are not specific to Creative Agendas; it's about what you do and say at the table, and whether it helps you get that feeling or not.<br/><br/>For instance, some people might say that they get "more immersed" if, in their game, people talk about their characters in the first person ("I open the door and..." as opposed to "my guy opens the door"), and if people act out dialogue (especially in funny voices) as opposed to just talking about it ("I chat with him for an hour and try to convince him to sell me his shoes")/<br/><br/>My own experience has been that I can play and design games that are "immersive" in the way I like by identifying those specific elements, while still using a huge variety of other techniques (especially techiques common to "Story Now" Narrativist games).<br/><br/>So, it sounds like you want to enjoy the feeling of dealing with the life choices of a vampire (for example), from the perspective of the vampire--through his or her eyes. It might be helpful to consider specific things in games you have played that help you do that, and things that distract you from it. (When I say "specific things", by the way, it's usually better to start with stuff the players in the game were doing, as opposed to stuff written in the rulebooks.) For example, it sounds like Vampire's "combat/intrigues/powers" did NOT help you immerse. If you can figure out why, for you, that was annoying, you can start building a list of criteria.<br/><br/>With that criteria, you should be able to narrow down the choices significantly. I haven't played as many games as most people here, so they'll be able to advise you better than I on specific games.<br/><br/>Edit: Apologies about the massive cross-posting!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173586/#Comment_173586" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T13:32:52+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  1:32PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, for what it's worth I think that Spirit of the Century, Full Light, Full Steam, and The Committee For The Exploration of Mysteries while talked about as "Story Games" ("Story" being ANOTHER really problematic term) are really strong Simulationist facilitating games.

The best thing to do is find some friends who are up for that kind of thing, and play that kind of game. <br/><br/>I am not sure that there are games that *enhance* immersion, but I definitely believe that there are games that are harder to immerse with. Off the top of my head, it would be a game with a lot of "handling", that is rolling dice, keeping eyes on stats, all throughout the engine: Like, be it combat, talking, spirtual stuff: Everything uses the same mechanic, and you have to be aware of what resources you have, and what you can do, at all times. Agon and Nine Worlds are like this, I believe. The Shadow of Yesterday can become that way, too.<br/><br/>Moving towards a game with less "handling" (some people equate this to "rules light", but I don't always agree: I believe you can still have a ton of stats and numbers and stuff on your sheet, but can still immerse as long as you don't have to be aware of those numbers/stats at all times: 4th Edition D&amp;D, frex: In combat, yeah you're pretty much Zero Immersed. But outside of combat, there's a lot of empty space there with no rules/numbers so that, if you tried, I think you can get immersion even more than previous editions of D&amp;D IMO).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173595/#Comment_173595" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T13:52:38+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  1:52PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you can't discuss simulationistic games and why they are such without understanding the concept of simulationism, first. And based on your short description you'll still need to hone your understanding of GNS to get there.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can just read some coherent simulationistic games very carefully and contrast/compare with some other games that you know aren't simulationistic. That way you'll get a sense of what an author trying to transmit a simulationistic agenda will focus on. Some such games that I like are <i>Dread</i> (the jenga one) and <i>Dead of Night</i>, which both I find very coherent and clear in their simulationistic agenda. I'd quote other titles, but the fact is that the great majority of sim design is very incoherent and much of the time you'll end up finding another type of game in there. For example, I'd suggest <i>Solipsist</i>, <i>Primitive</i>, <i>Vampire: the Masquerade</i> or <i>Planescape</i>, except that I can easily imagine how somebody so inclined could read any of those and end up playing them towards some very different creative agenda.<br/><br/>Also, checking out the games Jesse mentioned might be useful in that they are very good examples of how story-focused a simulationistic game can be. The sort of understanding you display is very typical of the so-called GDS or threefold model, which is an older rpg typology that is simpler to understand as a totally separate thing from GNS. Threecorner categorization of games depends very much on teleological sorting of GM motivations for play, which pertains to how you characterize narrativism above: what you describe is not actually narrativism, but <i>dramatism</i>, which is one of those threecorner categories. Thing is, a great majority of modern simulationistic games is actually simulationistic-dramatist - sim in GNS terms, dramatist in threecorner terms. So what you actually describe above are the two main technique families of simulationistic gaming.<br/><br/>But anyway, that's all rather fiddly and will probably require a long thread of discussion to sort out, if you're interested. Personally I recommend checking out good simulationistic games and comparing them to others to see how they differ. Better yet, go play with a solidly simulationistic crew of hobbyists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173643/#Comment_173643" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T16:45:24+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  4:45PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for your answers. I have read them several times, and tried to somehow clear up what I am trying to say, and it's not easy. At some point I would really like to understand GNS as alluded by Eero Tuovinen, because it's really handicapping my communication (story building is dramatism, which is simulationist but not narrativism? my head hurts). However for the moment I'll rather try to deal with the situation at hand (if someone has some current introductory text about GNS that allows me to speak on the same terms with everyone, I'm interested).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom your posts I gather that simulationism is meant as emphasizing verisimilitude of the game universe (which seems logic), but that is not exactly what I want, although it may be a condition. I also understand that immersion is a problematic term since it's usually used when the game "clicks" for you, regardless of the reason for which it clicks, so I'll stop using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm really interested is experiencing a situation from the character's point of view (POV). Ideally I would like to see things through his eyes, and think things through his system of beliefs, but in reality I can only be me, not him, and the best I can do is to project myself into a virtual situation and try to imagine what it would be to be in that situation, how one would see, feel things in that virtual situation, being in the shoes of a virtual character.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the game of Vampire I would be interested, I would imagine what the character would feel when discovering the nature of the changes he's undergoing, the different ways he would freak out, how he would explore his nature and ultimately how he would deal with it on a more long term basis. As soon as the answers to these questions are reached, the game is over for me. So the Vampire RPG I tried to play was not an option for me, since as soon as the PC starts joining a faction he has made a choice and solved the game. For me the vampire game was over even before it started.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started roleplaying, I thought verisimilitude was very important to reach the PC POV. I played RuneQuest and was happy to learn that their combat system was based on "extensive experience gathered from the society of creative anachronism", or something to that effect. I mean, I never had a sword in my hands, how can I put myself in the brain of a knight if I have no clue how a sword fight goes? Without such knowledge, I can't know if the knight would chose to fight or not. But my experience with that system was a lengthy number crunching that totally crushed my capacity to invest the scene. A short fight would last over ONE HOUR in real time, which totally destroyed my suspension of disbelief.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although intuitively I thought a game system with lots of "handling" (as Andy puts it) would help me be in the same frame of mind as my PC, my experience was the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is the following: do you think there are game systems or techniques that improve our capacity to better endorse the frame of mind of our PC, that enhance the emotional connection with him (ideally I would like to experience his emotions, as it happens in a novel, where you experience by proxy what the protagonist experiences)?<br/>\n<br/>\nSince system matters, and it is clear that some game systems are an obstacle to that, then I would assume that other game systems would actually favor it, the same way some game systems facilitate story building.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there where quite a few games mentioned, many of which I don't know (I'll read about them). Nevertheless I'll try to comment about those I know:<br/>\n<br/>\n- <b>Spirit of the Century</b>: I have recently read it and it reminds me of HeroQuest, in the sense that it facilitates the projection of the PC persona into the game scene (with aspects for SotC, and Traits and relationships for HQ). However this is not what I have in mind. These games allow the PC to impact the story the way the player intended them to, but do not necessarily facilitate adopting the PC's POV. Simply the PC is more efficient when acting according to his stipulated nature, it does not help the player to adopt the PC frame of mind. So if a PC has "Last Man Standing" as an aspect, then it will be easier for the player to play situations in which the PC is the "Last Man Standing", but it does not inform the player on what is going on in the PC's head. Why is he the Last Man Standing? the PC is a black box whose external behavior is described by Aspects/Traits, etc. I would like the system to somehow help the player to enter the black box.<br/>\n<br/>\n- <b>Trollbabe</b>: I also read this game but have so far no experience in running it. I think it seems very efficient in setting up interesting situations and playing around with social dynamics, but I don't think it helps the player to get in the head of the PC. After all, from what I understand of the game Trollbabes are just the perturbation that ignites trouble, and the focus is on the general trainwreck taking place around the Trollbabe, not the Trollbabe herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n- <b>PTA</b>: another game I recently bought, but did not yet have the time to play. Interestingly this game centers around PC's personal issues, so it might be close to what I have in mind, but the highly formalized story building makes me think that you don't really explore the PC system of beliefs and emotions, but rather build an interesting narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I agree with Eero Tuovinen that playing with people with the same agenda helps getting what you want, and with Paul's comment that adopting the "I" form instead of "he" for the PC may help. But all those are not really part of the game system. Perhaps that's not something that the game system can facilitate, but I'm not sure about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173651/#Comment_173651" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T17:07:01+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  5:07PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex,<br><br>That's all good stuff.

In the vampire example, I would not be interested in playing the guy before the transformation, and also not after he decided what to do about the transformation. Maybe you need a minimum of setting up so that you can actually get familiar with the belief systems of the PC before they are challenged, but it the crisis situation that interests me.

If you're interested in a recent effort at learning GNS, check out <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26760.0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> from the Forge. In general, consider taking the in-depth examination of the topic there; I have no doubts about my own or Jesse's understanding of it, but there are others who are used to explaining GNS there as well. Or I guess we could do it here, but that stuff <i>does</i> steal all the attention in any given thread.<br><br>You discuss immersion a lot, which reminds me of some discussions we had with Ben Lehman a couple of years ago. Ben claimed immersion is a <i>technical</i> agenda, by which he meant that it's a powerful, flexible tool that helps players get what they want from a game. It is, however, not the thing you want, but just a tool that might seem like the ultimate agenda because of how powerful and useful it is.<br><br>The tricky part that was already touched upon up-thread is that immersion means many things to many people. Another viewpoint, which I think I saw Ron Edwards or some such advocate at one point, is that immersion basically just means being really invested and interested in the game. I have no difficulty with accepting both of these viewpoints and more, as people really do use the word to describe all sorts of things about their experience.<br><br>But that's just immersion. What Jesse is shooting at with his questions is the more fundamental issue of what you want out of roleplaying. If immersion is "getting really into it", then you facilitate it best by playing with a rules system that directly provides things you are interested in. If immersion is a powerful tool that you have to learn to use with exercise to improve your roleplaying experience, then the tool will only provide satisfaction if you use it towards your genuine interests. That's what Jesse is driving at, above.<br><br>Other than that, though, if we're just interested in how games facilitate immersion, that's a pretty straightforward question for ludography. Historically, at least the following methods have been used explicitly for the purposes of immersion:\n<ul>\n<li>GM fiat or GM-controlled mechanics that remove mechanical choices from the player experience, letting them concentrate solely on the fiction and their character in it. The same ideal can be seen in larps that strive to have everything look as authentic as possible, so as to let the players ignore the real world in favor of the fantasy.</li>\n<li>Information control techniques to unify what the player knows with what the character knows. The Finnish rpg <i>Myrskyn aika</i> did this by partitioning the setting background materials into easily compartmentalized sections, for example, with the intent that players would only read the parts their characters would know about.</li>\n<li>Mechanics that strive to emulate the fiction. One of the more impressive examples of this is the above-mentioned <i>Dread</i> (which is not only a simulationistic game, but also a highly immersionistic one, too), which strives to make the conflict resolution process stressful for the player as well as the character by using a jenga tower as the resolution mechanism.</li>\n</ul>There are all sorts of other things, too, I'm just drawing this stuff from my own superficial understanding of the topic. Immersion-focused hobbyists could probably list all sorts of techniques that are used to facilitate it in games explicitly made for the purpose. The difficulty there is mostly in that most immersionistic games I know are Finnish; Dread is pretty much the only English-language one that has convinced me to any degree.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173661/#Comment_173661" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T17:34:08+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  5:34PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Alex, do either of these options strike a chord more one way than the other?</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThinking about your Pendragon knight example, both forms interest me, the later being a special and more flamboyant case.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">just to experience feeling and believing them...</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThat's something I would be interested in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173663/#Comment_173663" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T17:35:37+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  5:35PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

When you played Vampire, the guy sitting next to you might have been completely immersed in the sense that he was highly engaged in the material the GM was serving up (involving supernatural troubleshooting, I gather?)  Your dissatisfaction has nothing to do with system, setting, or even character, it has to do with what the game was about. You were in a game that was not about the stuff you were interested in.  It wouldn't matter if I pointed you to 50 places in the game text that incorporated things you were interested in - the GM (and other players, I presume) focused elsewhere. <br><br>This is one of the great strengths and dangers of big sprawling flexible games like Vampire (of any edition).  "Incoherent", pshaw.  There has to be some campaign and character <i>planning</i>.  "What are we going to do in this game?" is a key question.  (And one the game text repeatedly reminds you to ask at every stage of the pregame process.) <br><br>I assume the GM never promised you that you would be able to explore the things you wanted to explore. If they did, they're a filthy liar and a terrible GM. I assume that there was only a vague sort of conversation about what the game was going to be, and you ended up assuming one thing and the others ended up assuming something else and everyone was scratching their head at each other going "what the hell is that person doing?"  Tightening up that conversation is the only way to get the material you want to engage with.  Now, once the material is there, there may be other barriers that other people have identified in this thread (player vs. character knowledge, system that you don't understand, etc.)  But those are individualized and different for everyone. For some people, adding up a stack of d6s doesn't break their "immersion", for others, touching a die does.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173687/#Comment_173687" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T22:29:18+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 10:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think I know what you're talking about, and what's causing all the confusion (of course, it's GNS and the term "immersion"). There's such a thing as character immersion, or deep immersion, in which you strive to forget completely that you are a bunch of people sitting around a table. This is quite possible in short, and under certain circumstances even prolonged, time periods. There are many techniques that serve this agenda (for what it's worth, I definitely think this is part of the Sim agenda, though only a subsection of it, as Sim is sort of a catch-all category).<br/><br/>A friend of mine is really into this sort of gaming. He's also building a system designed to allow for this to happen. Taking all of the mechanics and making them invisible to the players is a basic step, even to the point of pre-rolling all the dice rolls, so that the players aren't jarred out of their hypnotic groove by the sound of dice. Avoiding all metagame talk and thinking is also crucial, and there are techniques like "portals", where you step into and out of your character.<br/><br/>Is this the sort of thing you're looking for?

(This sort of play can make NPCs more important than PCs in some cases, if the other players are not as focused on this level of immersion).<br/><br/>For them the key techniques seem to be<br/><br/><b>Story focused on personal traits</b><br/><br/>Stories should focus on the character's personal dilemmas and beliefs, but not necessarily to challenge them. A story focused on the character slowly falling in love with someone and then getting married is as much of interest as one about their loyalty to their master being tested.<br/><br/><b>Unobtrusive mechanics</b><br/><br/>Tactical play, multiple combat options, detailed systems and the like are often contrary to immersive play, as Alex said above. The more the mechanics pull you from the fiction, by making you make choices based on rules systems, the less immersive you are. Mechanics can be detailed and complex as long as your choices can be purely story driven and still make mechanical sense.<br/><br/><b>Realistic mechanics</b><br/><br/>I think this is the Sim bit, it's breaking to immersion to suddenly be confronted by rules that allow (or forbid) something that it seems clear ought to be possible for your character. Basically you want the rules to support what you expect to happen, fantastic or otherwise. As with Dread that simulation can be of a movie trope, rather than GURPS-style crunchy reality, but they are still simulating something clearly. Loose and vague mechanics are not an aid to immersion (you can see this in some LARPS, where the rules just don't tie up with the story ... e.g. no touching, or no weapon props or whatever).<br/><br/><b>Detailed cause and effect</b><br/><br/>I link this to the above. What I mean by this is that it helps immersion to play your story in detail, with the cause and effect of character actions clearly detailed, so that you feel you are interacting closely with a solid and external world. When you describe opening a door you want to move on to a description of what is outside, not to skip ahead to some other scene, because that breaks the causal link in your head between what you are doing and how that feeds back to your character. This often turns into an obsession with detailed physics (you can spend an hour working out how to cross a chasm), because it feels real to you, and you (the player) experience the character's trepidation at dangerous physical risk.<br/><br/>Often story-focused mechanics break this link. If you say to players "frame the next scene" or "tell me where we are now" or whatever, they get jerked out of their immersive state, because such questions often need to be answered as players, not characters. Even if the end point is the same (e.g. "I go to see my contact the fence") the process of getting there is important.<br/><br/>Saying "Okay, we cut to the fence's shop, where I am arguing with him" can break the immersion, whereas saying "I make my excuses at the party, leaving early. Then I catch the bus across town, and walk the last bit in the rain, because I can't afford a cab. When I reach the fence's shop I start banging on his door, demanding he come and see me." doesn't, because the detailed chain of cause and effect is unbroken, and you know how your character got where they wanted to be. The more you step out of the fiction to make choices which skip the detail, the harder the immersion is. (I've seen this problem with detail-light fiction mentioned before in other contexts, so it's not all about immersion).<br/><br/><b>Character advocacy</b><br/><br/>By this I'm trying to imply a non-actor, non-director, non-pawn stance where you expect to advocate for your character (not advocate for their failure, or for what makes a good story). This is a key element that makes some (but no means all) Narrativist games anti-immersion, because they expect you to play with more of an eye to a good overall story than the in-character choices made at each step. When I play games with immersion focused players, nothing ruins the mood more than asking "where do you want the story to go next" or "What do you want to happen to your characters", because they don't want to choose that plot direction, they want to get their incrementally by in-character choices. meta-thinking is not something they like (even when it creates a better game).<br/><br/><b>Limitation of knowledge</b><br/><br/>This is related to the advocacy technique. Just as a player wants to make choices from a character POV, they also often want to limit their knowledge and story contributions to things that their character knows and has control over. So most immersive players are happy to describe, for example, what their room looks like, because it's in their character's control, but not what the King's throne room looks like, because it wasn't in their control. This can also apply to vast areas of world creation, so long as they feel it was in their remit. So it isn't un-immersive to detail massive backstory, or even the culture of your entire race, provided it's *yours* (i.e. no other player's culture), but even the slightest bit of setting creation outside your characters remit is jarring. (There can be exceptions of course. If a player is really *seeing* the fictional world in their head they will often add details external to their characters because they have already visualized it before it was described).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173723/#Comment_173723" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T03:30:04+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  3:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 3:34AM by Graham.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Alex?\n<blockquote>Do you think there are game systems or techniques that improve our capacity to better endorse the frame of mind of our PC, that enhance the emotional connection with him?</blockquote>\nGNS is good stuff, but doesn't cope well with immersion.

This is mostly because Ron doesn't believe such an agenda can or should exist, and has at least a couple of times claimed that an immersionist agenda is impossible, that all immersionists are just fooling themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut let's put that aside.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeep immersionism, as I have defined it, is having as the ultimate goal of roleplaying to completely immerse in the character, to the point where the experience becomes something akin to selfhypnosis, hypnotherapy, or Jungian role-playing. The idea is to identify completely with ones character, so that it's never "he" or "she", but "I" who feels, says and does things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people shun away from this style of play, declaring it either "dangerous", "psychotic" or simply "pretentious". Be that as it may, it's still a valid agenda and there are techniques to help achieving it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why we deep immersionists want to immerse so deeply, is different for each individual. Personally, it's Katharsis. I have a certain amount of angst, anger etc in my life, and by playing out and living those feeling but inside a fictional character, I come out relieved, happy and ready to get on with my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, on to techniques:<br/>\n<br/>\nHituro has made some very good points, but I'd like to make my own list of techniques here...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Portals:</b><br/>\nIn order to immerse completely, it is useful to have a distinct door, threshold or, as I usually call it, portal. A portal can be something simple, like a special music that's always played when we are playing and are in character, or more complex, like spending fifteen minutes at the beginning of every gaming session with our eyes closed, answering questions in first person about our characters. It can be objects - when I get into my character, I have this old lighter that my charatcer also owns, and which serves as my link to him. Grabbing that lighter is a portal. Portals are a systematic approach to entering the semi-hypnotic state, and should remain fairly constant throughout a campaign. There should also be some sort of "panic button", some kind of signal to the GM that we need to abort NOW, because things are becoming a bit too... emotional, or whatever. Think of them as the "safe words" used in an entirely different sort of roleplaying...<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Hidden mechanics:</b><br/>\nOpenly rolling dice, adding numbers and checking tables are things which require active participation in the "real world", therefore hindering the deep immersionism; from being your charatcer you are suddenly turned into a nerd sitting round a table with other nerds. Not very immersionist. So; if there are game mechanics, they must be designed in such a way that they don't seem like mechanics to the players or their characters (since, for the purposes of deep immersionism, they are one and the same). A character might think "and then I shot him", so verbal commands and communications work well. The character, unless also a roleplayer, is unlikely to think "and then I attack for +3 in DAM against his DEF". Game statistics in the traditional sense should, therefore, be eliminated from the social interaction. There can still be such a system, but if so, then the GM must hide it completely from the players.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The story/narrative is not important. The characters are:</b><br/>\nWe cannot always be the masters of our own destinies. A lot of the time, stuff happens around us that we cannot control. The same should go for the characters. I don't pretend to have a lot of say in the "story" of my own life, and neither do most of my characters. Even talking about the events around the gaming table as "stories" is anti-immersionist, because the lives of real people just don't work that way. More on that later. For now, I'll just say this: It is important that the characters/players be allowed to be and act as themselves and as they see fit, but it is NOT important to keep the "plot" non-linear. Railroading is by no means impossible here. Sometimes, it's even good to railroad, because the focus then becomes more about the characters in themselves and their reactions and interactions, and less about the Big Plot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Non-episodic gameplay:</b><br/>\nNot may of us live in episodes. Things happen, and one thing seldom waits for another to finish. It's all mostly a big jumble, with a thousand different things to think about and try to do. In traditional roleplaying, there's the Adventure, and there's the Campaign. The Adventure is more or less complete in itself - it has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and a bunch of npc's which are only relevant for the duration of the adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI propose a non-episodic style, where adventures do not "begin" or "end"; but where thing simply "Happen". The characters/players may be asked to do things by different people, but they don't form queues. Things don't wait for the characters. It all happens continuously.<br/>\n<br/>\n(...wait for it...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/krank" title="krank"><img alt="krank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/krank">krank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173738/#Comment_173738" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T05:18:09+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  5:18AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (...continued...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Props</b><br/>\nProps are another technique borrows both from Jung and from the theater. I mentioned a lighter before - to the character with the lighter, I also had a set of clothes, and a black leather coat, and a pair of round mirrorshade sunglasses. Of course, I don't look like my character - but if all round the table dress up at least to some degree, and you're comfortable with eachother, dressing up and using props can really make you FEEL like your character. They help in creating and going through portals, and in keeping the illusion alive when playing. The smell of the clothes, how they feel against your body... It can help, is all I say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, deep immersionist play is not for everyone. Those of us who like to go REALLY deep find more than a few things in... other kinds of roleplaying (sexual, jungian) that can really help. Deep immersionism is not like the other types of roleplaying. It has more in common with method acting, with hypnopsis, with active dreaming, than the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh my, this because a rather long post, didn't it? I hope at least some of you found it at least somewhat interesting.

As a counterpoint:<br><br>For instance, many people who consider themselves "immersionists" aren't looking to be hypnotized or experience anything first-hand, but are just looking to enjoy a character's perspective, how the character changes, etc.<br><br>For instance, in some typical Forge/indie/story/hippy games, such a player might enjoy a situation where:<br><br>They are trying to rescue a priceless, ancient painting from a raging river. They know that they can gain a bonus to the roll (or whatever mechanism is being used) by crossing off another element on their character sheet. And the elements they have are: "Linda, someone I adore and wish I could be with" and "I am committed to overturning slavery".<br><br>The player crosses off the slavery thing, and rolls to save painting. The player then realizes that, wow, his character cares more about a dead piece of art than he does about the lives of the slaves in his country! And this realization is fascinating to her or him--watching the character grow, and experiencing these choices, and how they transform the character.<br><br>Or maybe the player realizes that, no, both those things are way too important to the character, and narrates instead how the character stops struggling, sits back, and watches the painting sink in the river, a tear rolling down his cheek. So, in this case, the rules and structure of the game are pushing the character in different, unexpected, interesting directions, and that's what this particular player is into. He or she might not get that thrill without those rules or mechanics.<br><br>I don't know if that helps show how the "immersion" thing can really, really vary. (For example, some people can get very "immersed", even trance-like, when playing a game of chess.)<br><br>Also, your comments about the vampire and your interest in dealing with the vampire's choices, and nothing before or after the "interesting part", sound well suited for a lot of what is considered "Narrativist"-supporting design, as opposed to Sim. I don't know if that's actually the case, since I don't know you, but you might want to check that out as well. <br><br>Overall, though, as others have said, looking at real play experiences you've had (whether good or bad) and sharing them with others is probably the best way for you to get some feedback and opinions.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174163/#Comment_174163" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T13:01:24+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  1:01PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 1:03PM by jackson_tegu.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These answers have been really interesting and helpful!<br>David and Mikael and Paul, thanks so much for sharing your ideas!<br><br><br>And Alex, do post about an actual experience you've had and what was good about it-<br>i'd be interested to read more specific details and everyone's responses.<br><br>thanks!<br>-jackson                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/krank" title="krank"><img alt="krank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/krank">krank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174372/#Comment_174372" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T14:25:54+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  2:25PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, you make an excellent point, one which makes it clear why I usually don't talk or write about "immersionism"; I prefer "deep immersionism".<br/>\n<br/>\n...actually, I'm not sure I consider what you describe as any sort of immersionism, really. Though I can't think of a better word for it - "exploration of character" is kind of longish and also doesn't really tell us much about what it's really about. So I guess I'll have to fall back on "immersionism" to describe it. Which, again, makes me happy to have chosen a different term to describe what I'm doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea I've been tossing around as a sort of middleground between totally engrossing deep immersionism and kind of narrativist/storytelling/metagaming, is to make heavy use of portals and have two different types of play in the same game. Overarching story is handled by some sort of collaborative narrativist system, but when there's character interaction - such interaction being, as a guy I know puts it, "the action scenes of roleplaying games" - we "zoom in", use some kind of portal technology to quickly get into character and mood, and play out the scene. And when the interaction is done, we zoom out again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntercharacter communication - put simply, talking - is when it's really possible to "play out" the scene more or less as it is - body language, pauses, eye twitching, frowning... all of these can be done in real life. Matrix-style firearms combat or fighting mechasuit-wearing ninjas, not so much. This is just a jumble of ides right now, you understand, not a finished concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n//Krank, who's kind of tired, and might not make as much sense as he'd like to                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
