<br/>
Over at the Endeavour section at the Forge, Ron advanced the concept of role-playing drills.<br/>
<br/>
So, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19292.0" rel="nofollow">I posted one</a>. Get thee hence and tell me what you think.<br/>
<br/>
But wait, you say, why is this here when most of us are also Forgites anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Well, because I wanted to make sure Kuma saw this I commented on whether similar stuff would be applicable for the workshop.<br/>
<br/>
Kuma, are you reading this?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            You know, I realize I have a purely asthetic revulsion to the idea of "role-playing drills."  Micro-games, role-playlets, rp-quickies would all be the same damn thing, but without the PE overtones.<br>

And that sort of sums up why I'm here, too.                        </br></br></div>

                            Judson, <br><br>I find myself agreeing with you. <br><br>See, I want to develop RPG skills and I very much like the idea of doing things in order to help push particular skills. I take this hobby pretty damn seriously, and want to be all I can be and all that jazz. <br><br>But when I hear "drills" my whole brain screams and runs away. I'd much rather just play an actual game that helps hit the skills I want to get at (things like Dogs and Capes are pretty good at helping get at individual skills) than do excercises seperated from game. <br><br>So, rather than just dump on this and walk away: Can those of you into the idea of drills explain to me why you'd rather drill than play a one-shot of a "stealth training" game that builds similar play muscels?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Well, I could see playing a micro-game of "I expect you to die."  It looks like the whole thing takes 5-10 minutes (I'd think I'd set a time limit rather than a sentence limit, unless it's being played in IRC or something.)  You know, to pass some time, or as a warm up, or even as a set of little games with a running score or something.<br>
<br>
But there's an unpleasant implication connected to "role-playing drills" that just sets my teeth on edge.  It makes it work, you know?                        </br></br></div>

                            It may be the word itself. <br/><br/>It may be the stance, however. I'd rather actually play to practice actually playing than to do katas or drills in order to learn to actually play. <br/><br/>Honestly, this may just be a kneejerk thing on my part. In just about anything else I do I know the value of drills: I do them for writing, for theatre, for .. fuck... lots of stuff. I'm not really sure why I'm having the spaz here.                        </div>

                            bq. Would you prefer role-play kata?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here's the thing.  I have a possibly just odd, maybe socially-unacceptably skew motivation for role-playing: I'm trying to have fun.  I really like it when I do something really profound, or find out something about myself that I didn't know before, or otherwise produce Something Meaningful, but honestly, that's all flavors of fun, and if there's no fun, there's no reason to play.<br/>
<br/>
So if I'm going to do something to hone skills or whatever, they need to be fun.  And if you call them drills, or kata, or practice, then they don't sound fun.  <br/>
<br/>
And I know that sounds childish, but follow me here.  It says to me that in your mind, they shouldn't be fun, and people designing them will abandon the fun in the pursuit of Higher Role-Playing Skills or whatever.  It just sucks all the life out of a role-playing idea, and makes it into a Federal Healthy Role-Players Initiative or something.<br/>
<br/>
Does that answer your question?                        </div>

<p>I buy that.  It gets at some of what I don't love about the sense of "drills" ... that they aren't meant to be fun foremost ... in fact, Fun Now.  They sound like investing in something boring in the hopes of more fun down the line, and I'm ag'in anything like that.</p>
<p>I've been using the term "Warmup," because it sounds (to me) like what I intend it to be:  We can't start cold, so let's do something active and quick and fun, until we're limber enough to get on to the main event.</p>

                            Terminology is definitely an issue, but these exercises can be fun. I really enjoy the Creative Combustion exercises we do with our church Sunday school. These exercises are derrived from improv theater. I also found the training for these very valuable, especially learning about offers and blocks. I think some formal training in this area would be valuable to any gamer, especially GMs.<br/>
<br/>
At a party last Friday, we played a couple of these games when a couple of the people introduced them (they were taking a theater class). Playing the games definitely helped bring the group together, especially the new guy. We played "cheese" and "zip zap zop." I was initially reluctant to engage with cheese, but once I was it, it was fun. And zip zap zop was quite fun (and we occaisionally zip zap zopped all throughout the rest of the evening).<br/>
<br/>
With the Sunday school Creative Combustion games, we (almost) always debrief after the game. That helps bring out what the game is supposed to exercise (and the exercises are good, even if you already understand the concept).<br/>

                            Hi, :)<br/>
<br/>
Judson, Tony, I follow and agree. The drill _must_ be fun, it must be Fun Know. If a drill isn't, it should be summarily discarded in favor of one that is. And if we can find no drills that are, then we don't drill. With you.<br/>
<br/>
(I have no idea whether IEYToD is Fun Now or not. I'll try it this next Friday, and then I'll tell you.)<br/>
<br/>
El Fuego, hmmm.... insightful, but slightly skewed, IMO. Yes, martial arts katas were presumably designed by experts and fixed ages ago, and now they're taught by people who know to people who don't know, but I gather that that's just because they've been what they are for ages.<br/>
<br/>
Presumably, if I'm knowledgeable of something, I may be able to devise a kata and then teach it to you, and you may find it worthwile for you even if you are twice the expert I am at that something. It's not that I know something you don't, it's that I created something new and it may well have value. Or not.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if someone should come along that is more of an expert than the kata designer, they can even take the design, tweak it, hand it back to the designer, and they can call the designer "grasshopper", and it will be Very Cool(tm), because that's probably the way it went down for martial arts All Those Years Ago!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, your comment about crazy designs was spot on, and maybe that's where katas come from, too.<br/>
<br/>

<p>No, on several levels.</p>
<p>First:  We aren't always able to <em>do</em> all the things we <em>know</em>.  If I create a game that teaches a certain skill (like gleeful opposition in Capes) does that mean that I must be the ultimate master of that skill?  No, it does not.  It means that I figured out a good way to teach the skill.  Personally, I <strong>learn</strong> from playing Capes, every single time.  I practice the skill, and I hone it.  So the assumption that a drill-maker must be perfect (or even <em>good</em>) at the skill is bogus.</p>
<p>Second:  As JMendes points out, drills are useful to those whose skills are superior to the drill-maker's.  Just as I can become better at providing opposition by playing Capes, a roleplayer <em>far my superior</em> can also improve their skills with the same tool.</p>
<p>Third:  Many people <em>are</em> better than you at certain skills, and you'd be dumb to ignore the possibility that they in fact <em>do</em> know some wisdom that you would benefit from.  Pretending that we're all equal in all ways is both arrogant and ignorant.</p>

bq. But can we _please_ stop calling them "drills?"<br/>
<br/>
I mean, seriously, guys.  I've got real issues with the word, and not mere aesthetics.  I really agree that "drills" and Anything Now don't seem to go well together.  That and the association with a dentist's chair isn't attractive.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything to recommend the continued usage of "drills"?                        </div>

                            Well...the problem is that now we've got two names for the same thing. Over on the Forge, they're drills; and here, they're either Katas or drills.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'd stick with drills. It's an OK name. And it's the one that's been used over on the Forge, so it's good for consistency.<br/>

<p>The Forge has a strongly entrenched habit of mis-naming things. I suggest that, if you object to the "drill" term, you use your own preferred term, prominently and frequently, <em>at the Forge.</em> Change the world by changing yourself!</p>

                            Tony --<br/><br/>First: <em>yes!</em>  Let's learn from Capes, which is a challenging game, not a drill.<br/><br/>Second: <em>yes!</em> Let's get everybody of every skill level, higher and lower than our illustrious selves, to practice, and let's get them to do this by offering them a challenging game -- like Capes.<br/><br/>Third: <em>yes!</em> Many people are much better at many things than I am.  I will readily admit this!  You, sir, are far <em>iMuy Macho!</em> than I am; Brand has far broader cultural understanding than I; Jonathon can, like, talk to people and come to consensus better than me.  I've got no problem admitting that.  What I've got a problem is anybody -- you, me, Brand -- telling anybody else that they're the better one.  That smacks of arrogance and ignorance to me.  But we can very easily sidestep that by offering, not drills, but challenges and challenging games.  "Here, try this!  What happened?  That's awesome!" is so much more straightforward and honest than "Here, do this, do it this way, and learn this lesson."<br/><br/>See what I'm getting at?  I'm hardly saying that I or anybody else can't learn from something.  I do take issue with people setting themselves up as instructors.                        </div>

<p>I see what you're getting at.  I just don't view "instructor" as such a crazy-arrogant term to arrogate oneself.  It's just saying "I've got something to teach."</p>
<p>When I hit black-belt at the jujitsu dojo where I studied, my sensei said "Y'know, you've been commuting an hour each way for years to practice here.  You really ought to just set up a school out where you are, and save yourself the drive."  And I replied "But I don't know everything!"  And he laughed and said "Yeah, but you know way more than you need in order to teach."</p>
<p>I would argue that we have an awful lot of black-belt level roleplayers, and they ought to be prodded to take on the role and responsibility of teacher.  They ought to be thinking things like "Hey ... I just had a really good idea for how to teach people to get past the My Guy syndrome ... it's engaging and fun and slides the message in through structure ... I'm a teacher, that sort of thing is my job ... I should publish it, so other people can learn from it!"  But that's just me.</p>

                            Tony, I think we're mostly in violent agreement.  The distinction comes down to whether you are setting up shop and offering a product that is primarily fun or primarily to teach people how to do things your way.  Selling a fun product is all sorts of good stuff.  Selling a product as pedagogy is... less so.                        </div>

I don't know that I'd like "I expect you to die", but then, it's a game that hilights activities that I'm not all that interested in including in my normal gaming.  An etude microgame that attempted to help the players become better at implicit stakes-setting or narration-sharing would be more along my style.                        </div>
