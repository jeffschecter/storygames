The Diction Cards would now be individual cards (which would make this a much more involved game), where words would specifically tied to a particular suit.<br/>A primary Narrator (the Game Master), would be using the standard deck of playing cards to lay out situations based on their suits, that would represent either people the characters meet, situations they are in, or discussions they are having (again, trying to make it feel like an Oscar Wilde play or a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jeeves and Wooster</span> story). The characters would choose their narrative ability to deal with it. Matching suits and colors would gain so many points to overcoming the situation, while adding Diction cards of certain suits would add or subtract from that score.<br/>Maybe having a rotating Game Master, much like Robin Laws' RUNE game?<br/><br/>Still, I would like to hear from anyone who bothered wading through the verbose morass that was my entry. Anyone?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
