I proposed a couple of mini-mechanics which, after some discussion, evolved into this "Connections with NPCs give bonus Action Points" rule below.<br/><br/>Now, before we actually trying <i>playing</i> with this thing, I'm very curious what other folks think, particularly about where this mechanic will break or cause screwy effects.<br/><br/>The rule as it currently stands:<br/><br/>1. Making Connections<br/>        If you, as a player, find a particular non-player character engaging, you may declare that NPC as a Connection.<br/>        - You must have roleplayed some kind of meaingful non-combat interaction with an NPC to declare him or her a Connection. "Interaction" can be as little as a few lines of dialogue or an exchange of Meaningful Glances.<br/>        - If the NPC doesn't have a name, he or she should immediately be given one. (Even if the player-characters have no reason to know the name, the PLAYERS should know).<br/>        - You may declare a Connection at any time during or after such an interaction, EXCEPT during combat. (Once the battlemap is out, you go to war with the Connections you have, not the Connections you would like to have).<br/>        - Write the name of the Connection and a brief reminder of who he or she is on a piece of scrap paper, with a check box to help you track when you spend and refresh Action Points.<br/><br/>2. Benefits of Connections<br/>        Having a Connection grants a bonus Action Point.<br/>        - The first time you make a Connection with a particular NPC, you immediately gain one Action Point, in addition to any you may already be entitled to.<br/>        - This Action Point is spent as normal, but it does not refresh at "milestones."<br/>        - Instead, the next time you roleplay a non-combat interaction with the same Connection, you get to refresh the Action Point from that Connection. (If you haven't spent that AP yet, there's no effect).<br/><br/>3. Losing Connections<br/>        You can lose your Connection and the Action Point that comes with it.<br/>        - If your Connection NPC is killed or harmed in any significant way -- including broken hearts and hurt feelings -- you immediately lose your Action Point from that Connection (if you haven't already spent it) and cannot refresh it, unless and until you rescue, heal, or otherwise restore the fortunes of the NPC.<br/>        - If you permanently leave the locale where an NPC lives, such that you are unlikely to come back for at least several sessions, and the NPC does not come with you, you immediately lose your Action Point from that Connection (if you haven't already spent it). If in a later session you do ultimately return to that locale, you can refresh the Action Point as normal by interacting with the NPC.<br/><br/>4. DM is God clause<br/>        The DM is the final arbiter of all questions about whether an interaction is "meaningful," whether an NPC is "harmed," whether combat is currently in progress, and any other ambiguity.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155641/#Comment_155641" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T10:19:50+00:00" title="July  9, 2008 10:19AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2008 10:22AM by Valamir.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may wish to limit number of contacts a character can have.  Level would be the easiest restriction.  Number of sessions played where a given "location" was featured might be more meaningful.  That way you don't have to rely on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> to keep players from racking up 50 APs with "And I want to tell a bed time story to the bakers children...all 6 of them..."<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may also want refreshing them to require something.  Perhaps winning a social skill check (a gang leader PC could "intimidate" the local shopkeepers...connections of a different sort,...) is required to refresh with the Difficulty increasing with each refresh...so your Contact would be "Frenk the bakers son, 3" indicating that you refreshed Frenk 3 times so the difficulty for the social skill check is now +3 (or maybe it needs to be +2 per refresh).  Anyway, this difficulty can be reduced by doing favors for Frenk (run a side mission like "find my lost puppy", or give Frenk's da 50gps to keep his business from failing, or whatever.  That way players can start to treat the contacts like resources to be tended on a par with the way they'll tend to their Magic Items and power selections.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may also want to limit when the AP can be used, or what it can be used for by who the contact is and what the nature of the relationship is...if you wanted to make it a little more involved.  Like the AP you get from your connection to Mara the healer woman can only be used to gain an extra action that involves recovering HPs.  the SP you get from your connection to Zaine the crazy tinker can only be used to gain an extra action to Aid Another.  The SP you get from Darg the captain of the guard can only be used to gain an extra action to use a Daily Power...that sort of thing...if you find the extra tactical crunch appealing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155646/#Comment_155646" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T10:27:44+00:00" title="July  9, 2008 10:27AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problems with actions points have already been noted - perhaps you'll be using some sort of hack in that regard as well to make additional action points actually useful, but not game-breaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside, I don't see much problem apart from the fact that this subtracts focus from the adventuring and adds it to relationship play. Presumably useful in setting up adventure hooks, though, as the connection can always threaten to break up if the character doesn't go do whatever is in the connection's interests. Adds some punch in that regard. I suspect that I wouldn't institute something like this without reworking the mode of play radically as well, myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155699/#Comment_155699" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T15:01:19+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  3:01PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard of systems that simply tack on a new reward have less problems then fiddling with the Action Point (or Healing Surge) economy.  What those points do would be up to you (maybe just a bonus, maybe more).<br><br>Awesome idea, Syndey. I'm going to riff a bit.<br><br>I like Valamir's tending idea.  It seems Connections shouldn't be severed by harm, death, a broken heart, etc.  In fact, any change should be promoted. So, instead of tending being skill challenges (or in addition to) any change in status could provide a fresh number of points.  Someone's dependable mother who bakes them pies doesn't give any points. But when Mom is kidnapped by goblins, or marries the baron, has a fight with your brother, or demands quality time during the holidays, then points are given for dealing with the relationship.  Or something like that.  Make them a fuel for story instead of only filling out the background.  You might even have a scale.  As the relationship proves itself more and more central, it rises up the scale, granting more points.  The trick is, once it maxes out (say 5? A number = to level?) you can't tap it anymore. It's effectively resolved (until you gain a level, perhaps).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
