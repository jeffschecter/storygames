A lot to think about here. Some initial thoughts, maybe. Let's break it up into pieces.<br/><br/>1) What are important aspects of a Men in Black adventure?<br/><br/>  - The "New Guy" approach: One or more PC's should be a new Agent for ease of in-character introduction to the world (How did this person become an agent? Were they an agent in the past with their memory wiped? Are they fresh off of the street? Are they an alien transfer from another planet?)<br/><br/>  - The Big Bad Alien(s): The essential, disgusting, sinister creature that threatens to destroy earth (What kind of alien are they? Why do they want to destroy (or enslave or whatever) earth? How are they connected to things that have happened in the past?)<br/><br/>  - The Minions: Does the big bad have any grunts that work for him? It's nice for players to have some kind of butt-kicking-fodder (Why do these aliens work for the big bad? Are they just intergalactic mercenaries)<br/><br/>  - The Informant Alien(s): Probably not friendly towards the MIB, but possessing important information none-the-less. It's a staple of the movies to have the MIB slap around some kind of alien trash for information about the big bad. (Will they be able to get the information they need? Will the informant betray them? Will the informant get splattered for spilling the beans?)<br/><br/>  - The Friendly Alien(s): Come up with some kind of sympathetic aliens that the players must help, or seek help from, to thwart the big bad plan (Maybe they're the ones with the key to destroy the big bad? Maybe they have information the MIB need? Maybe they just need protection?)<br/><br/>  - The Weird Aliens: Not central to the plot of the story, but pseudo-connected to things or maybe just interesting or even funny (Might blend with Friendly aliens, but their presense is more about the weird factor that the victim factor)<br/><br/>  - The Crazy Technology: Every movie has some kind of new crazy guns, or gadgets, or vehicle modifications (Probably nuff said)<br/><br/>2) What is (my opinion of) a good way to create a scenario for a family with kid(s)<br/><br/>  - A short, player-oriented introduction booklet for everyone to read. One copy per person works best<br/><br/>  - Various pre-made characters with some blank spots. Probably at least two per person to choose from. (I'd do them as Men In Black Official Agent Dossiers)<br/><br/> - Try to summarize the rules on the character sheets as much as possible (even if they're just bullet points that the players may need to get clarification from you on. Once they get that initial clarification, the bullet points should be sufficient from then on to remind the player the gist of it)<br/><br/>  - A relationship map, possibly with blank spots (again, done up as an Official MIB document. An in-character player handout)<br/><br/> - Lots of art!<br/><br/> - City maps! (Probably NYC?)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406857/#Comment_406857" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T15:00:48+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  3:00PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a nice start.

I don't think we need to struggle to be ultra original - some familiarity and tropes would probably be welcome for newbies. So, let's say the Big Bad is trying to get an item of power. It's not a power source (MIB 1), it's not a weird unfathomable energy in the form of a creature (MIB2) and it's not a planet shield (MIB3). So what is it?<br/><br/>What if some kind of recent event awakens or frees the Big Bad, who now wants to escape earth so it go back and wreak havok on its homeworld. Maybe it used to be some kind of notorious slaughterer and, since being on earth, the people of the Big Bad's homeworld have been able to enjoy peace. So Big Bad is trying to find a way home, and for whatever reason, the only way to get there is through a special device that generates a worm-hole (Tannhauser Gate?) back the home-planet. Only, that device is currently disguised as a piece of art currently on exhibition at the Guggenheim Art Museum. Then maybe you've got one of the aliens from this homeworld as a shady citizen that the agents can hit up for information, and if the guy finds out that the Slaughterer is trying to get back to his home planet, joins their cause.<br/><br/>Just a few thoughts to start out with. Any interest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406868/#Comment_406868" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T16:16:22+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  4:16PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is excellent, very excellent!

Not to mention, the Slaughterer doesn't give two craps how many people see its true, ugly, alien face. So you've got the whole global extraterrestrial masquerade to worry about too. Maybe the Tannhauser Gate is volatile and, if used incorrectly, could explode in a massive firestorm that would level the entire city?

I like that. Hmm... That gives me ideas... If you wanted it to be more 'epic' save the world style...<br/><br/>Maybe, the <i>Harbinger </i>(or whatever the big bad might be) has arrived and wants to open a wormhole to bring his army of fiends to conquer earth. He plans to use a Tannhauser Gate, a device designed to cross the Einstein-Rosen Bride with a quantum tunnel. Great for moving a whole army from one planet to another, but only a few were ever created and most have been lost to history.<br/><br/>Here's the catch. If not calibrated correctly, it could create an event horizon so powerful that the massive magnetic bubble it uses to contain the wormhole might fail, which would swallow up the entire solar system and leave nothing but a hungry black hole. So naturally the MIB would outlaw it from earth, right? Seeing as it's so dangerous? <br/><br/>Well, turns out the Harbinger has some serious connections and a shadow cell of Astrinian blackmarketeers (?) have brought one to earth for cold, hard galactic credits. They have disguised it as a piece of art and are transporting it from Paris to New York for exhibition at the art museum. No surprise the Harbinger plans to disintegrate the treacherous dealers as soon as he gets his hands on the Gate, paying them nothing and pursuing his plan to summon his armies. <br/><br/>Will the agents be able to get to it before the Harbinger does? What if they manage to get their hands on the gate, but not take down the Harbinger? What if the Harbinger gets his hands on the Gate, but it's damaged during the chaos? What if the Gate is destroyed and the Harbinger goes on a rampage?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406893/#Comment_406893" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T20:48:09+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  8:48PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good line of thought, I'd say.
