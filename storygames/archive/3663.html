I like the 64-pagers too, you know.<br/><br/>As for DS, it is the only full-scale sci-fi setting built on d20 Modern and powered by d20 Future. (That's part of the elevator pitch.) It's a "firm-science" setting. We have a technical advisor we vet all the science stuff with. Everything in the setting is theoretically possible (including our take on psionics, "Red Truth"). The setting was designed to permit a number of different sci-fi sub-genres, e.g., bug hunt, space opera, Space Western, alien relic hunting, etc. Most people say it (at least the OQL book) has a strong Firefly vibe. HR and our upcoming mega-adventure Shadow War, I think, are gleefully steeped in <i>Battle Beyond the Stars</i>.<br/><br/>Although it is d20, the mechanics are, by and large, very clearly segregated from the setting material. I think it would be a simple matter to run an adventure or campaign using a different ruleset. I could even see SG-style games in the setting, e.g., DitV in the Eotian faction camps, Burning Empires as part of a vaasi invasion, etc. You can also download a ton of freebie support off our <a href="http://www.dawningstar.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>, including extensive previews of all the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82235/#Comment_82235" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T09:00:22+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  9:00AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intergalactic Cooking Challenge is a lovely looking little game.
