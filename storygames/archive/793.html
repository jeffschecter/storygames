                    The convention is in an airport hotel near Heathrow. When I arrive, they've marked me down as getting in for free, because I'm running a LARP. It's a nice touch.<br/>
<br/>
I put up a sign-up sheet, with seven male roles and six female ones. I also write that, if anyone wants to help me GM, I'd appreciate it. (I had someone lined up to GM, but they pulled out at the last minute.) <br/>
<br/>
I inspect the space set aside for my game. It's perfect: two conference rooms with a quiet hall between them. Lots of corners for people to plot in. Great. I even have a flipchart and a clock, so I write "The first race will begin at sunset: 7pm" and set the clock so that it'll hit seven an hour into the game. I like anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
With two hours to go, the sign-up sheet is nearly full. The problem is, it's full with women. Seven women are signed up and only three men. One of the women has signed up for a male character. It's slightly irritating - I don't like cross-casting - but okay.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm happy. Better still, a reliable-looking bloke called Mike volunteers to help GM. He seems to know his stuff, so I agree. He's American and has a refreshingly blunt turn of phrase: "Here's what's going to happen. I'm going to read through all these character sheets, then I'll talk to you."<br/>
<br/>
An hour to go, and I'm sorting out playing cards and setting out the motorcycles. The game is now full, with three men and ten women.<br/>
<br/>
30 minutes to go until the game. I'm laying out character sheets and putting the final touches to the room. Mike, my co-GM, is firing questions at me: "Question! What happens when...", "We have a problem!" and so on. He finds some issues ("What happens when you run out of Love cards?") for which we develop instant fixes. We could have fixed them when they happened, but earlier is better.<br/>
<br/>
I go to the players and distribute character sheets. "Would you like to be a high-school student or a gang member? OK, do you want to be the gang leader, the womanizer or the bad guy?"<br/>
<br/>
Pleasingly, many players are in costume: rock T-shirts and leather jackets. Myself, I don't like wearing costume, but it's flattering when people make the effort.<br/>
<br/>
And then it's time to start the game.<br/>
<br/>
(Hang on. More after Doctor Who.)                </div>

                            Thor, I will, but I'm going to fix a couple of things first. There were a couple of issues with the currency system - nothing major, but it needs tweaking.<br/>

Give me a week or two and I'll put it online.<br/>

(David Tennant's good. The new series is fun: it didn't really kick into gear for me until the Cybermen arrived, but now it's really good. A two-parter starts tonight.)<br/>

                            (Bloody hell, that's the best new Doctor Who episode I've seen. Fantastic.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm standing in front of eleven players in black T-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
I'm nervous about this game. It's much more reliant on mechanics than previous games I've run and it's got a currency system. I'm well aware that this game will throw up all kinds of problems with that system. Also, there's a way of winning the game, and win conditions do funny things to people.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm nervous about running the game with this set of players. They're mostly drawn from UK Freeforms, a British mailing list. They're very enthusiastic, very experienced and nice.<br/>
<br/>
But they refer to their LARPs as "freeforms" (several people asked me about my "Meat Loaf freeform") and aren't fond of mechanics. One girl, after reading the character sheet, told me: "I'm not really good with rules. I probably won't use them". Which was worrying.<br/>
<br/>
And they're standing there, looking rather worried, possibly because they'd just read the character sheets, which explain the rules.<br/>
<br/>
So I do my enthusiastic, energetic thing. (I like standing in front of people and being enthusiastic. In fact, I think one of my LARPs was very badly designed and only succeeded by me being enthusiastic). I demonstrate the rules, which they seem to understand.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of questions: who can move a motorcycle? Can you take someone else's motorcycle? Can you use cards to bribe other people? I'd anticipated most of these questions, but not all, so I field them okay, making instant rulings on a couple of things.<br/>
<br/>
They still look worried. I enthusiastically explain (I'm standing on a table by now) that I haven't tried these rules before, so things will go wrong, but it's fine, we'll fix them, and "thanks for playtesting the game!". This last statement is meant to make everyone think that it's OK if things go wrong and, hey, let's play with the mechanics and have fun with it! Instead, it makes people look worried. There's a chorus of blank stares, if stares can form a chorus.<br/>
<br/>
By now, I'm actually really doubting whether this will work. I'm anticipating having to call people together after an hour: listen, guys, thanks for coming, it's not working, let's leave it there, thanks again. Trying to keep enthusiastic, I send the high schoolers into one room and the gang members into another, and we start.<br/>
<br/>
(And now I'm going out for dinner, so more later. Do feel free to jump in on this thread if you'd like to, but don't feel you have to.)<br/>

                            (All right, where was I? Thanks, Thor, by the way.)<br/>
<br/>
The players start by chatting in character and, within minutes, they're using the mechanics. Fantastic. More specifically, they're using the sex mechanics: in other words, they're all off in corners shagging.<br/>
<br/>
It's immediately obvious how potent the combination of sex and fighting is. The mechanics encourage people to have sex and fight. So...they go off and have sex, and then someone's lover sees them having sex, so there's a fight...and so on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, people are doing stuff with the bikes. They're putting modifications on their bikes, repairing them, and the wayward daughter is sabotaging her father's bike.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the first 45 minutes are a dream. As GMs, we hardly have to intervene except to explain the mechanics (within thirty minutes, we get asked what the mechanics for a threesome are). Mike, by now, is being fantastic as a co-GM, making instant and sensible rulings.<br/>
<br/>
And we get to the first bike race. The races are spectator-driven: each biker holds up a card saying what they're trying to do that round, Mike holds up a card saying the road conditions and the spectators decide what actually happens.<br/>
<br/>
This works really well. Quickly, the bikers get the idea that they get rewarded for doing interesting stuff. So we get people jumping between motorcycles, people running each other off the road and the wayward daughter taking her top off and throwing it into her father's face. Excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Through all this, I'm doing crowd control. Everyone's excited and shouting and it's hard to get them to decide things like who's overtaking who. It's exhausting and exhilarating and I'm doing a lot of shouting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it's noticeable that it's getting a little competitive. When someone gets told they can overtake (symbolised by taking a step forward), they overtake just a little too much.<br/>
<br/>
Mike, the co-GM, is holding up the road condition signs. I'd expected things like "Gravel" and "Grass". Instead, he's doing things like "Clear highway, distant sound of police siren". It's fun stuff and, in the last round, he throws in "Cops waiting by finish line". <br/>
<br/>
And that's the first part. So far, it's immensely high spirits and yelling. It's only in the second part that it starts getting competitive.                        </div>

                            The players have been told that there's three bike races: at sunset, midnight and sunrise. So, after the first race, we advance time to 11pm. We tell the players to get drinks, if they want, and start playing as they come back in. Some start playing instantly, some go and get drinks.<br/><br/>We've made a last minute decision to say <i>where</i> the rides are taking place. The first one was a beach, so the board now says "The second race will be at midnight in Cutler's Canyon".<br/><br/>Mike is keen to follow through on his police plot. I hadn't anticipated this, but he's doing it well: using it to give the players choices. He approaches the father character as a cop and asks him to inform on the location of the next race. He does. Mike carries on with this with a couple of other characters. It's fun.<br/><br/>The focus has moved away from the mechanics, towards roleplay. There's a challenge for the gang leadership and a couple of fights about women.<br/><br/>Some problems with the currency system are starting to show up. Some characters are finding it much easier to get cards than others. Some have very difficult objectives: "Get someone to tell you they love you" is proving difficult. <br/><br/>It's noticeable that it's getting competitive. I'm used to writing rules rather vaguely, worrying about special cases (such as "can a fight stop people having sex?") later. But people are trying to win, so they feel bad when rules calls go against them. In other words, the rules calls really matter, and I'm not used to that. Me and Mike have to make sure we're consistent.<br/><br/>But it's still fun and it's going well. The game seems to be running itself, without us having to throw things in to keep the players interested. Mike is very happy: "This game doesn't need a second GM". I think he's wrong, actually, but it's good.<br/><br/>It's time for the second bike race. It's noticeable for two things. Firstly, it's a massive amount of fun. The bikers are trying to please the spectators: screwing with each other, trying to knock each other off the bikes, jumping, fighting. <br/><br/>Secondly, the competitiveness is seriously ramping up. Bikers complain, good naturedly, when the spectators rule against them. People are trying to overtake more than they should and I'm restraining them. It's fine, it's all fun, but it's clear there's real feeling behind it all.<br/><br/>But, best of all, two people die in this race. It's great.<br/><br/>The players have been told that the first character to die tragically "gets a Rock Card from every other player". In other words, it's a huge currency bonus. But they don't know what happens after they die tragically.<br/><br/>Now, each time someone crashes in the bike races, I've been asking them whether they want to die. Finally, in this race, someone takes me up on this. They ask for a death scene, which is fine, but they use their death scene to screw another biker up ("I die with my head through his spokes"). This is all cool, all good-natured, but noticeably competitive.<br/><br/>Luckily, as a GM, I don't have to decide whether the other biker crashes. I ask the spectators instead. They decide he does crash. I ask him whether <i>he</i> wants to die tragically. He says yes, even though there's no mechanical bonus (only the first person to die got the reward).<br/><br/>After the bike race, we ask them each: "What do you want to do now you're dead?". Both of them say they want to come back as ghost bikers in the final race. We agree.                        </div>

What were the player's incentives?<br/>
Was it just a cool scene they wanted to happen, or where there other factors in making this decision?                        </div>

                            Joe, that's a good question. The short answer is that I don't know.<br>
<br>
It wasn't a cool death scene. If he'd wanted a cool death scene, I'd have given him one, but he just died.<br/>
<br/>
So it was something else. Perhaps he saw it was towards the end of the game and he felt like a change? Perhaps he had the ghost biker thing in mind? Or it could have been the pressure of the moment: he was asked in front of a small crowd and that can do funny things to people.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he seemed to enjoy being a ghost biker later, so he seemed happy.<br/>

                            The third section is where the problems start to show up. <br/><br/>There's forty minutes until the final race. There's a real sense of anticipation, a real sense that this is the last chance to win. <br/><br/>But the competitiveness is bubbling over, and I'm getting flashbacks to my White Wolf days, where people are so into the game that they're losing the fun. One  player waits by her motorcycle for 20 minutes before the race, to make sure no-one sabotages it. Now, fair enough, perhaps she wanted to do that. But do I really want to write a game which encourages people to wait by motorcycles? Not really.<br/><br/>One player has been building up to the last race by <i>hiding</i> the modification cards (a modification card says something like "Turbo charger" and you stick it to your bike). I realised he'd been doing this earlier, and wondered whether to do an instant rules call ("Guys, don't hide the cards, it's not fun"), but that would have been unfair on him. <br/><br/>He's got six cards. There's only eight in the game. Just before the last race, he begins to put all these cards on to his bike.<br/><br/>Now, one of the other players is annoyed that he's hoarding the cards. So one minute before the race begins, she tries to steal his bike, by punching him. He, of course, doesn't want to fight.<br/><br/>And now we've got a real rules problem. In mechanical terms, she's challenging him to a fight over who gets the bike. But can he refuse the challenge? <br/><br/>When I read my rules back, they're ambiguous. I'd changed the wording at the last minute. Here is the wording on the character sheets:<br/><br/><i>When someone says or does something that offends you, you may challenge them: to a drinking contest or a fight or similar. They must accept your challenge.<br/><br/>You may also challenge someone to settle an issue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example, challenge them to a fight over who gets to be gang leader. In this case, you must both agree what the fight is about. </i><br/><br/>So the punching player is saying that the the challenge must be accepted. The player with the bike is saying that he doesn't agree to what the fight is about. Normally, I'd just make an instant ruling ("Look, let's say the fight goes ahead") and people would accept it. But it's clear that, since both players want to win, I have to be fair. (And I hate that).<br/><br/>I take the bike player aside and explain the situation: yes, the rules are ambiguous; but yes, I agree that it looks as though he could refuse the challenge; and just to be clear, was he refusing the challenge? He says yes. I say OK. I think it's a shame, because I'd love to see a bike stolen, but OK.<br/><br/>And I take the punching player aside. The way it works, I explain, is the other player has to fight but he needn't accept that the winner gets the bike. She reluctantly acquiesces. I explain that the rules are ambiguous and I'll change the wording. She's nice about it. It's a sticky moment but it's OK.<br/><br/>The last bike race goes like a dream. All the bikers are playing to the spectators now: they're doing cool jumps, they're jumping between bikes, they're writing fantastic narrative descriptions ("I speed forward, the moon glinting off my mirrored sunglasses"). <br/><br/>Halfway through the race, the two ghost bikers join in. It becomes two races at once, with the ghost bikers speeding ahead. One of them is pursuing a vendetta against the other and speeds towards him, making them both crash. "I think," says one of the spectators, "They should both become real for a second before they crash." So they do. It's great.<br/><br/>After the race, Mike and I have agreed that there's be 10 minutes of free roleplay to let everyone end their story. It's a mistake. Some people stand around, because their story ended with the last race. Some people use it to gain more Rock cards. <br/><br/>At the end, we sit down and take a breath. We count up the Rock and Love cards and work out who's won. I go through every player in turn and get them to sum up how their character's story ends. (This is what we should have done instead of the ten minutes' free roleplay). <br/><br/>It's a very satisfying ending, with the ghost bikers deciding they form a gang in hell and several couples going off together.<br/><br/>And that's it. It's been three and a half hours, much longer than anything I've run before. I'm exhausted.                        </div>

                            Feedback after the game was really good. I mean, don't get me wrong, everyone always says "thank you". But I really get the impression it went well. And the new players, who didn't know what to expect, especially seemed to enjoy it.<br/><br/>If you've got this far, thank you very much for reading. The reason I wanted to write it in this much detail is to set things in context. For example, take Joe's question above. It's impossible to explain why a player might decide to let his character die without explaining the atmosphere: it's very high energy, very exciting and everyone's staring at you, waiting for you to answer "Do you want to <i>die</i>?".<br/><br/>If you've got any feedback, give it to me, especially about the competitiveness thing. It really took me aback: I expected some competitiveness, but not so much, and it gave the game a very definite slant.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham, your 'disaster' doesn't sound so bad.<br/>
<br/>
1. You had somebody hanging out by their bike rather than socializing.<br/>
2. You had somebody want to start a conflict to acheive something and got blocked.<br/>
3. You had ten minutes of free roleplay at the end that was aimless.<br/>
<br/>
3's easy to fix -- don't do that again!<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised that, in denying the conflict, the guy didn't have to give up his bike.  Can the rules be rearranged so that, if you don't fight you are letting the challenger have their way?<br/>
<br/>
The first one is the hard one.  They really wanted to win the race, I take it.  Would winning the race have won them the game in terms of cards?  Or would their time have been better spent making love and getting in fights?  If so, was that made obvious to them?                        </div>

                            It seems to me like 1 &amp; 2 come from the same place. They're both solved if it's clear that stealing is on the table, and that it's a conflict to do so. That way a person can be assured that their bike or cards or what have you won't be taken away without their knowing. However, it also mean that turtling will do no good, because if you hoard stuff, it will naturally attract attention, and with attention comes conflict and Awesomeness.<br/>
<br/>
The 'they don't have to be involved in a conflict if they don't want to' seems weak to me. It means people with a lot of stuff will avoid conflict in order to avoid losing it. Thus you have these, admittedly minor, problems.<br/>
<br/>
Overall it sounds like a hoot and a half!                        </div>

                            Joshua and Remi,<br/><br/>The rules were written so that you could reject a fight about something you didn't want to have a fight about. I wanted to avoid situations like this:<br/><br/><i>Gang Member: I want a fight about whether I get to be Gang Leader!<br/>Gang Leader: But...I don't want a fight about that.<br/>Gang Member: I don't care!  The rules say you have to accept a fight!</i><br/><br/>In other words, you could reject a fight if you didn't agree to the proposed stakes.<br/><br/>Now, in retrospect, this went too far. Players <i>should</i> be able to reject some fights, but they should be obliged to accept fights when:<br/><br/>a. Someone's trying to steal their bike<br/>b. Someone's trying to stop them having sex (this happened a lot)<br/>c. Someone's trying to stop them sabotaging a bike<br/>d. Someone's trying to steal what they're carrying<br/><br/>So, as you both suggested, it's easy to fix. I'll just put that list of "mandatory" fights in the rules.<br/><br/>(It doesn't help that I tried to use "challenge" as a generic word to cover "fight" and "drinking competition" and...well...it made the rules unclear. I'll fix that too.)<br/><br/>So, yes, the harder problem is the waiting by the bike.<br/><br/>Remi:
<blockquote>They're both solved if it's clear that stealing is on the table, and that it's a conflict to do so. That way a person can be assured that their bike or cards or what have you won't be taken away without their knowing.</blockquote>
I think you're probably right. The problem is: I don't want a situation where someone wants to steal a bike without the owner knowing and <i>to do that</i> they have to find the owner and do a conflict. Then you'd get this weird player-character knowledge thing.<br/><br/>Actually, I know. I can give all the bike owners the keys to their bikes (symbolised by cards). To steal the bike, you need to steal the key. Of course, you can still <i>sabotage</i> the bike without having the key.<br/><br/>Does that solve it? I think so.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

That reads to me like a give.  Gang Member wins leadership by default.  Gang Leader should probably say "Okay, but if I win, I'll take you out: no longer in the Gang, and I take your bike.  Still wanna fight?"                        </div>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me like the blocking thing is really to keep the chaos to a minimum, right?  Like; one-scene-at-a-time per player, right?  So would it work if you institued a rule that just said that very thing?  You can block if you're already involved in a conflict, or something.<br/>
