                    How have you had fun role-playing with really little kids? <br/><br/>This <a href="http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20060401a" rel="nofollow">My Little Pony D&amp;D spoof</a> is obviously wrong; combining picky rules which bore kids with a story line and characters which bore adults isn't going to make for fun. But our children (girls aged two and a half and four and a half) spend much of their time making stuff up and telling stories together. Surely this energy could be effectively harnessed for my own entertainment? Their plots and characters are rather unsophisticated and they're very free-form in style; switching merrily between techniques of LARP (dressing up), miniatures (dolls), and a little pure description.                </div>

Also, I've had fun with Brennan's daughter at conventions playing "Capes" ... our rules are pretty much this:  We each set stakes ("If I win then the jello monster eats the enchanted forest, but if you win then you defeat the jello monster") and then we roll dice.  Whoever rolls higher gets their stakes.  Since the stakes from the adult are always reversible ("He ate the enchanted forest!  My stakes are to get him to spit it back out!") the game proceeds more by clever twists than toward any overall victory or defeat for either side.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: susan</cite>How have you had fun role-playing with really little kids?</blockquote>
The easiest answer to this question is to listen to what they already play.  My stepson (3) and my daughter (2) play the games they've seen on TV, from Spongebob Squarepants to other silly cartoons, or what we read to them (Mog, Benjamin Bunny).  For the younger kids, minatures are a MUST, but use it from their own collection.  Storm castles.  I do lots of sword fighting and lots of kissing and practicing words with both of them.  I do games based off "What would these creatures do in nature?" with our plastic dinosaurs, and "playing house" with the baby dolls.  We do have some large dice that we sometimes roll and we'll just play a game where I call out how many pips are on top.  [shrug]  Roleplaying with older children is almost harder because you're expected to provide just that little touch of more imagination, which takes energy.                        </div>

                            First, I have to mention, in case people are unaware, that there is a yahoo group called Kids-RPGs that discusses this sort of thing all the time. Come on over and check it out. <br/>
<br/>
Second, and I hope I don't sound too preachy or obvious, while you can sorta "harness this energy" for your entertainment, just realize that it's not going to be the same sort of entertainment you get with your friends. That is, your children are not your friends, and cannot (in a healthy way, at least) provide you with the sort of social feedback you get from play with friends. At best you entertain them, and get joy from seeing them learn and show you what they know. Which is great, don't get me wrong. It's just a very different animal. <br/>

                            Oh, damn, good catch Drew. Clinton ran this game for us at Origins. Wow. It has a slight bit of math (basically the DitV mechanics). But if they can hack that, or you're willing to help them out with it, then I'd say that this game is probably the best RPG for kids yet invented. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, in play, Brennan's character learned the trait, "Sometimes Bad People Do Good Things." How amazingly cool is that? <br/>

                            As Awesome as The Princes' Kingdom is, it's not really a 2-4 y.o.-appropriate game. I think 8 is probably the minimum age.<br/>
<br/>
Mike, it's substantially simpler than the Dogs mechanics from which it grew. You roll your Age, then roll whatever Traits you have. If the Traits are things that make your life easy, you roll d6s. If they're things that give you a hard time, you roll d4s. If you can count, you can figure out which dice to roll, and if you can add, you can find the appropriate pair to see/raise.<br/>

                            Er, yeah, Josh, as I've said, I've played it (and I've played DitV, too). And I mentioned the math. <br>
<br>
I personally don't think that there's any 2-3 year old appropriate RPGs. That is, this is the age where they're just learning verbal skills and for games getting used to simple ideas like turns and such. Even something as easy as Shadows is going to be too difficult for most kids that age. <br>
<br>
I started with my Alex at 4, and, though I think he's pretty smart, I still have to help him quite a bit even with simple RPGs that we've tried even now that he's 5. <br/>

                            At that age (under 5) they are very quick-minded, and trying to pin them down to a certain game or a certain system seems  dubious. I've had the best luck with just following along and getting into being an animal/truck/snowman, while trying to model good turn-taking and shared authorship, etc.                        </div>

Heh! No kidding! I introduced some of the scene framing and stakes setting stuff I stolen from games like PTA to the Floor Games I play with my daughter-She ended up wearing my brain out in around 45 minutes!                        </br></br></br></div>

                            It's hard to say when, exactly, you cross over into RPG territory. This morning Benjamin (who will be five in a few days) and I told a story with Everway cards. We took turns telling a part of the story, based on the pictures on the cards. We've done other RPG-like stuff earlier, like rolling dice to see who gets to tell, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun I've had is when we both have creative input, and there's some sort of system to decide who gets to say what happens at the end of a scene/conflict/thingy.                        </div>

                            Not <em>exactly</em> on topic, but I'm going to be running some kind of game for a dozen junior miscreants from our local juvenile detention facility next Tuesday - I've been told that they are "high spirited" and "like to move around a lot".  The topic is cryptozoology, so I'm writing a game that puts them in globe-hopping teams to go on monster hunts, roll dice, and shout a lot.    I anticipate a lot of fun!                        </div>

                            Having time to run around in the play is key, I think.  Elliot, the younger of my junior play group always insists on it, and he has a point. We oldsters might try doing some more too. :)<br>
<br>
And the advice I have is to make sure that everyone contributes--we usually take an idea from everyone &amp; bring it together for the setting: much like the tenet phase in Uni.  And when there are obstacles to overcome (because these kids know what makes a good story &amp; that means having things to struggle with) we all come up with one and face it in turn.  Helps if we each have some special ability that can come into play. Never hurts to match menace to ability. <br>
<br/>
What else? Arts &amp; crafts. Draw the characters, make a map, that's one of the things that makes it the most fun for me and what helps keep my interest.  Also, I have a much harder time when we use brand characters--the kids are way into NeoPets and Pokemon. Sometimes I go along and take one, but they are so steeped in the genre that it's more restrictive for our play (a character wouldn't do that, the physics of the world are such) or I just get lost in the whelter of details they can spin. If we are all making it up together on the fly it is more fun for me &amp; more creative in the long run. So I lean toward the original settings.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Always good advice Emily!<br/>
<br/>
I've run into some things similar to what you're talking about ( re: Brand Characters) when I've played various floor games with my daughter. When we use my collection of gaming minis ( usually centered round the villagers set from MegaMinis), we get a very different sort of game than when we used branded character toys ( such as her Winx Club action figures and dollhouse). In the first case, there is a lot more experimenting with adding personality, names, history, relationships and so on. In the second ( with the Winx), there's a lot of appeal to cartoon canon that I'm fairly unfamiliar with.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting also is that with the fantasy villagers, canon is developing. Much loved figures have become characters with set personalities and histories that "travel" even when a new table layout is in place. To some extent, this is also true of terrain. The resin terrain that is the interior of The Green Griffin Innn and a couple of the paper models have taken on something of a life and history of their own. Less beloved figures seem not to have become as realized/canonical and are likely to change in personality or history between games.<br/>
<br/>
One way I've seen canon breaks with branded characters is when two different groups of branded characters meet. All of a sudden, the canon breaks at the edges, and some characters become more flexible or re-moldable.                        </div>

                            Thanks for all your thoughts. I haven't replied because I lacked any kind of coherence on the matter but I did think of you this afternoon when we actually did it and it was fun. <br/><br/>I have a <a href="http://susan.sean.geek.nz/2006/08/geek-breeding-programme-success.html" rel="nofollow">blow-by-blow actual play</a> account on my blog (half a dozen paragraphs), short version follows. <br/><br/>They chose characters by photos: <br/>Hazel chose a pretty land girl, Lucy, who had been waiting more than an hour for a train that had her brother Harry on it, they haven't seen each other for a very long time and she is very excited that he is coming. <br/>Iris shuffled through the pictures, claimed WWII officer and said that she was Harry. <br/><br/>The train was just chuffing into the station with a squeal of brakes and a plume of steam and Harry could see Lucy out the window of the carriage. I turned to Iris (who, being only 2 1/2 to Hazel's 4 1/2, I guessed might be the less confident player) and said "Okay, so your train has just arrived, what do you do?"<br/>She leapt off her seat and rushed over to hug Hazel saying "I get off train, go hug my sister."<br/>"Oh! I haven't seen him for so long! I missed you!" said Hazel.<br/>"I say: 'I back now sister' to Lucy," Iris said.<br/><br/>I told them that after the noisy train left they could hear a strange "Tch tch tch tch tch tch" sound. (I thought it would be a big wierd brightly coloured bird and they might talk to it and hitch a lift or something). Hazel took over; she said<br/>"My character looks out over the fields (gesturing at the map) and up the hill beyond. She can see that what is making the noise is a ghost!" (Yes! I thought, not only playing but going hardcore! That's my baby!) <br/><br/>Afterwards Hazel told me, with pride, "You are in two role-playing groups now Mummy."                        </div>

If you're running around the living room (like an Owlbear perhaps), the coffee table can definitely generate some wound effects.  I think rules about no-eating in the laboratory to limit radiation exposure should also start at an early age...<br/>

Seriously though, for very young children I'd start them with make-believe games and maybe some very easy boardgames (Candyland?).                        </div>

<br/>
Not just RPGs, I'd say many (most?) games are "make-believe" of some sort, or are based on games that were make-believe in origin.  Chess is a make-believe game -- although a very highly abstracted one.  Ancient sporting games began as ritualized make-believe combat -- and modern sports evolved out of those.                        </div>
