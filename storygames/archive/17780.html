Time is not an issue, for example, unless it's "too long for goal X". Also, what if you roll an 11, shouldn't the answer to that just be "sure"?<br/><br/>Here are some options that would be what I'm taklnig about:<br/><br/>* You need a rare material and only (name other playbook here) has access to it.<br/>* You spend so much time on your project that something goes wrong in another part of your life (grades drop, etc.)<br/>* It will cost far more money than you have.<br/>* Someone important to you gains a string on you - guilt over your abandonment<br/>* A rival gets wind of the project and finishes it first<br/><br/>Things that actually are drawbacks. There's no "time" mechanic or "resources" mechanic in Monsterhearts so saying those are drains is not a drawback.<br/><br/>Also, no Darker Self should be able to get out of with a "realization". You need to concretely DO something. I would suggest: destroy all previous inventions to this point and burn all your notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402398/#Comment_402398" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T15:35:57+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  3:35PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make sure you explain how the Nightmare is different from the Hollow. They are different, but it helps to be clear on how. And I agree that getting out of Darkest Self needs more than a Realization. Would it be too hard if, for the Nightmare, breaking out meant someone else had to ask / offer what the Nightmare wanted / feared? The thing about the Nightmare is the character is so focused on others, and so this shifts the focus to the Nightmare.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402399/#Comment_402399" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-01T15:38:54+00:00" title="January  1, 2013  3:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trying to wrap my head around the Cursed.

And you know what? Lately, it has gotten worse. Accidents just seem to happen all around you, and they are certainly more malicious than usual..."<br/>And let the Darkest Self go Final Destination on everyone for being so mean to them all of the time. It just seems like a real excuse for as much havoc as possible?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
