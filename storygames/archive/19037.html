It's called The Ladykillers. I'm looking for some feedback and play testing before releasing early next year.<br/><br/><b>Playtesters get mention in the text and any of my existing games in PDF, including this one.</b><br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzxc8LOtvfOfZGNoeVBOUXh2WVE/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzxc8LOtvfOfZGNoeVBOUXh2WVE/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/><b>The game</b><br/>You play women who come back from the dead as assassins.\xa0<br/><br/>From the text intro:<br/><i>You died before your time. At least for a while. Someone, somewhere gave you another chance. The woman you were has returned to the world. You\u2019re free from darkness. But it all comes with a heavy price. Call it justice. Call it God\u2019s wrath. Curse it if you want. Redemption is out there. Peace. You would kill for that. And you\u2019ll have to.</i><br/><br/><b>Some thoughts for playtesting</b><br/><br/>Do the hitlist targets work out well? Do their number of hits make things to prolonged or too easy?<br/><br/>Are the aspect powers engaging, and can you tie them to the fiction?<br/><br/>Are there parts and procedures that are unclear? How could a summary or guide help out?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
