I've read it and there's lots of cool things in it including Fame.  Not quite the implementation I have in mind though.<br/><br/>From the infancy of the hobby, the entire concept of character leveling itself is a part of that gold mine.  You see it in a ton of games apart from Prince Valiant.  Legacy stuff from Pendragon or Microscope, writing a piece of history in the Dictionary of Mu, making maps in Geiger Counter or On Mighty Thews; there are hundreds of examples where either individual creative input or tactical prowess is "stamped" and given a sort of permanence or reality.  Every instance of "Yes, and" across a constellation of game sessions...<br/><br/>I mostly mean a more literal gold mine.  Like, not just "it's a hot design aesthetic that has a lot of potential for what it might bring out in play," but "collectible, well-produced character achievements you affix to your character somehow and which are earned though step-on-up play could be a huge seller a la Magic the Gathering/World of Warcraft/Farmville."  On a smaller scale and within its niche, of course.<br/><br/>edit: Gamma World 7e and Risk Legacy are doing some interesting things along these lines.  Apocalypse World's playbooks tapped into it a bit as well.<br/><br/>Also, sorry for the threadjack - I'll stop.  Skyrim has lots of things going for it including some cool signifiers for character achievements, but it also gets slammed for how few of those achievements are reflected in the world around the protagonist in terms of how the NPCs respond to the player, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355327/#Comment_355327" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T12:22:47+00:00" title="January 22, 2012 12:22PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not the biggest Skyrim fan, but my experiences with it and other sandbox games are informing how to prep for a dynamic sandbox game.<br/><br/>Things to keep: Random events can make interesting emergent stories, unstable situations made more unstable by player interaction, keeping a consistent world, and repeat after me...emergent stories, don't aim to tell one, just let one happen as the players interact with the game and the setting...oh and maps, and history behind everything is cool.<br/><br/>Things to change: <br/>the world moves at its own speed, sometimes the player will have no choice but to be swept up in events. Example: The Civil War in Skyrim, add a damn timer to that, have things happen beyond their control, see how they react to it. <br/><br/>Focus, make sure everyone is on the same page of what they will be doing. Be upfront with what interest you, the GM, and have players tie in their motivations to it. Seriously, if you're into exploring caves and have elabrate structures to explore and delve, and the players want to run a blacksmithing operation...there is going to be some dissonance. Skyrim is a game, so it can get away with forcing you down a path.<br/><br/>Also...consequences, when I sacrfice people to Dark Gods, damn it! The game world should respond with more than quest complete, here is some token XP, and YET ANOTHER magical artifact.<br/><br/>Finally, the world exist as its own entity. It is not leveled.

They look like this:<br><br><b>Recovery/Rescue</b><br/>Lost Vessel: Ithaca<br/>Last known location: Neptune, Triton orbit<br/>Reward: 15,000 credits<br/>Contact: Issac Njembwe, Oasis, Mars<br/>XP: 2,000<br/><br/><b>Privateer Charter: Terran Mandate</b><br/>Wanted: Vessels for active combat duty<br/>Reward: 25,000 credits per deployment<br/>Contact: Major Katherine Ford, Terran Mandate, Paris, Earth<br/>XP: 1,500 xp per combat deployment<br/><br/><b>Scout Report: Mining Surveys</b><br/>Universal Dynamics Corp.<br/>Wanted: Survey scans for uncharted areas<br/>Locations: Asteroid Belt, Mars, Jupiter<br/>Reward: 5,000 + credits (each)<br/>XP: 750<br/><br/>There are 21 of those in play right now (organized by location and faction). SWN has a faction mini-game that the GM plays every in-game month, which determines which factions prosper and which suffer, and those outcomes make new opportunities appear and others vanish. Plus I just create some new ones when I get a new idea.<br/><br/>I use the news feeds to keep the group up to date on solar system events (the cold war is about to get hot, so there's lots of crazy reports about warships being mobilized, for example). This is usually just a short snippet or two whenever they have some down time in transit or at port.<br/><br/>My NPCs are also free to take on contracts, so I sometimes slip tidbits into the news feeds about another ship completing a job, or getting blown up, or whatever, just to keep the world feeling alive. In the last session, the PCs ran across an NPC freebooter crew who had accepted the Terran Mandate privateer contract and were flaunting their new status.<br/><br/>Maybe that covers it? Ask questions and I can say more.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
