To find a trap you roll two dice and add them your Sharp. 7-9 some result, 10+ some other result etc.<br/><br/>Game 2. To find a trap, you say what you do. If you push on the red plate with your shovel, you'll see that it's on stiff hinges and would fall if you stepped there.<br/><br/><br/>In Game 1, improvise all you want. There might or mightn't some meta rule in place for how many traps you can offer.<br/><br/>In Game 2, interacting with the prep <em>is the resolution system</em>.<br/><br/><small>There are also games that historically started as having only mechanics from those two categories ("1/6 to hear through door" and "If you step on the plate you step on the plate") but has merged to include variable "difficulty classes". "To find a trap you roll a d20, add your Perception, and try to overcome a value, and that value varies from trap to trap." Arguably these systems have the same problems with improvisation as Game 2 while enjoying less of the "tangibility" benefits of Game 2.</small><br/><br/>My statement. The referee can't make up traps as they go and still be a referee. There needs to be "hat separation" in order for this particular resolution system to work.<br/><br/>Now, can the trap in the room be invented while the characters are in the hallway but before they enter the room? I guess.<br/><br/>This article is part of "the mirror argument". The mirror's effect being set before the players even step in the room is part of the resolution system for that particular game.<br/><br/>Games that use other resolution systems, like PbtA, are not bound to this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462570/#Comment_462570" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T10:19:38+00:00" title="April 28, 2017 10:19AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know actual PbtA is "lead with the fiction" but for the sake of argument Game 1 differs from PbtA in that regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462588/#Comment_462588" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T14:39:46+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  2:39PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2017 3:11PM by Airk.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, the disconnect is that you are (again) maintaining that improvising requires you to make up stuff when the players start interacting with it, instead of making stuff up before that.<br/><br/>You can totally improvise with method <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (as you "guess") if you decide, as the PCs open the door into that segment of hallway or room or whatever, that there is a red plate covering a pit trap or whatever.  Then the PCs can interact with it just as if it were "prepped".   But you are still improvising.  You are just doing it in a fashion that allows you give the PCs useful information and be prepared to present it as part of a coherent environment instead of saying "Yeah...uhm.... you push the plate and...erm... it's actually lid to a ...a...box built into the floor!" or worse "You enter the room, and uh... there's a... red plate on the floor and you... step on it..."<br/><br/>You can't safely improvise this stuff in the exact moment, but improvising in the exact moment is the GMing equivalent of running out in front of the train to lay tracks.  It's much more sensible to have a least a 100 meter headstart. <br/><br/>Even in the Game 1 example, everything works better if you already know what the trap is.<br/><br/>I don't understand why you keep bringing up examples of this difficult and problematic playstyle and asserting that somehow this is "how improv works" and then pointing out all the problems.<br/><br/>You shouldn't need to "guess" that the trap can be invented while the characters are in the hallway.  This is, as far as I am concerned, the only sensible approach to the situation - it shouldn't be treated as some sort of weird fringe case.   You should not be making up more details about the room once the PCs are in it, unless you are playing a game that explicitly uses systems where a die roll or something can literally add an all new element to the fiction.<br/><br/>It feels like you are constantly attacking a strawman, because I don't feel like deciding this stuff in the literal moment is a sensible, sustainable way to improvise a coherent universe, but you continue to approach it as the default no matter how many times I say "I don't see why you would do that when you can do ";  Maybe this is all because when you did your improvisational stuff, you improvised everything in the moment, but as you have discovered, that's not a good idea... but even a little bit of forethought prevents 99% of the problems with this method and doesn't require you to perform extensive prep just to maintain a coherent world.  <br/><br/>To take "improvising everything at the absolute last possible moment", find problems with it, and conclude that the correct solution is to prep everything in advance feels like a crazy pendulum swing instead of the extremely modest course adjustment that it could be. <br/><br/>Now I'm not saying you can't run a game with full prep if you want to - that is obviously a nonsense suggestion - I am just saying that the style of play you appear to be seeking can be achieved without it.  The mirror needs to have an effect when it enters play, not when it is revealed, and not two weeks in advance when you prepped it.  I'm not even saying there are no <i>advantages</i> to prep, because presumably you can come up with more intricate and detailed 'stuff' if you are prepared to spend large amounts of time on it.   But it's not a <i>requirement</i> for the playstyle you are seeking.<br/><br/>I mean, in all honesty, I wouldn't want to do a fully improvised dungeon crawl anyway, but my "prep" would be for my benefit, not the world's. It'd be like "There's an entryway with three passages leading out of it. One goes down into the goblin's roach hatchery, one is just a dead end, and one leads further into the complex.  There are barracks with kitchen to east, and to the west is the chief's area with a throne room, and a hallway with a pit trap leading to his hoard."  Because this helps me structure my thoughts and make sure I'm including all the stuff that I feel should be in there. But it's not rigid or binding - if I realize that, crap, the goblins probably have a common area, or a slave pit or something, it's easy enough to add that.  If I decide that a pit trap is a dumb idea because this is all hard rock and who chisels out pit traps in solid granite and that a deadfall makes way more sense, then as long as the PCs haven't encountered the pit trap yet, I can change it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462592/#Comment_462592" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T16:13:10+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  4:13PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Sandra and Airk, though a bit more into this and I realized a couple of things I'm ready to reconsider and concede a bit. I'm sorry if I often come out as someone who changes his mind constantly but It's my nature that once I calm down a bit and find some new information I may end up conceding things and changing my mind. I often forget to mention this -that I've just changed my mind a little-, even when speaking in person. But that's who I am, whenever I feel I've reached a wall when discussing things with someone, I rethink things, try to put myself on their shoes, negotiate and go in a different direction trying to reach an agreement. I get frustrated because I usually expect people I'm arguing with to do the same, but I understand sometimes it's not meant to happen, and that is alright, we can perfectly agree that we disagree.<br/><br/>Back to the point: I'm with Airk on some points on this; sorry but for me too Impro means "making up stuff at least 10 seconds before I have to frame it and then stick to it", while "modifying stuff as I talk" falls more like into a category of what we could call "desperate firefighting", like a last resort ugly fix to prevent the session from losing flow, momentum or going into an uncomfortable direction, etc.<br/><br/>The use of this last resort, while I already acknowledge that it may mean that things may go worse, that it's nothing but lying to the players and/or manipulating them to give the illusion that everything is right and fair, that you know exactly what you are doing and if they don't like it it's their fault - and worse things. While I do acknowledge that things may go this way for some groups, ruin the fun and confirm the bad rep the hobby has, I also believe that tis so called firefighting should be guided, restricted and purified, as it's quite hard to be entirely dismissed by some groups and some others have even been able to turn it into a sort of patchwork dialect that remains functional despite all it's baggage.<br/><br/>I mean, being as roleplaying is partially a conversational activity where real-life conversational skills are applied, mixed with literary resources like descriptions, metaphors, tricks like changing the pace and point of view of the narrative, and other techniques - and that it's even invaded by other media like drawings, music and more, players and DMs end up reasoning that anything goes. Even things like deception, misdirection, illusionism, etc. Among magicians there's something known as "force of cards", which is a method by which the magician can influence people to make certain choices and still make them feel like they chose freely. Dunno how the equivalent in roleplaying is called, but I'm sure it's there among the illusionism repertoire.<br/><br/>So it's sadly common but anyone coming into the hobby can/will bring (and too many have already brought and thaught) these tools into the conversation, used them plenty and become so good that they won't need to change those with real fair rules. It's even possible to theorize it enough into something that could be called it a fully functional valid playstyle. Some would cal it an idiom, I tried with dialect before but now I prefer to call it "desperate firefighting" in absence of a better term. Mostly because it tries to fix a problem, but does it in the edge of a situation that shouldn't have happened; in a way that can definitely go wrong and that may generate a toxic gameplay if abused, when the players realize what's actually going on. <br/><br/>It's such an easy solution that GMs can become addicted and not notice that their group is no longer having fun. From the other side you can have players that go into denial or some sort of stockholm syndrome and collaborate to maintain the game going, or that are just too occupied enjoying other parts of the game to actually care. Usually for GM that stick to this practices, that's the case and the important thing: nobody cares, nobody has to notice, we're not ruining the fun of anybody and even preventing ruining everyone's fun with this so called white lie. That's why it's so hard to think of this in the bad light it can get to have in the wrong hands.<br/><br/>So basically:<br/><br/>Impro \u2260 lying                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462593/#Comment_462593" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T16:21:21+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  4:21PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Surely it's useful to distinguish between improvising qua impro and in-the-moment prep at the very least in a technical sense?

Mentally.  So I also wouldn't have PREPPED anything that would be useful to fall back on in those situations.<br/><br/>Those are usually the times when it's a good idea to call a break and be honest about the situation though, and even if you don't, you have to honor your commitment to not change what is established.<br/><br/>All that said, I don't think improv and illusionism and its techniques are related at all, except in the sense that you can lie to the players about whether you are improving or not, and you can lie to the players about whether their choices matter or not.  You can also lie to the players about whether you already put in your share of money for the pizza, or about whether you believe in Santa Claus.

And that I had prep for the other choices too because otherwise players will feel cheated out of their options.<br/><br/>On time, players will realize that it's not possible for you to prepare for everything and so you will have to admit that you do improvise a bit. I've heard and witness a few players resenting not about being cheated out of their choices, but mostly about learning how the GM makes and places their smoke and mirrors. (no pun intended, Sandra) They didn't care about quantum ogres, they just wanted to fight and ogre!<br/><br/>And then somehow in the hobbie, the worst GM isn't the one lying to their players, but the one who broke their illusion by saying too much or not being convincing enough when they lied.<br/><br/>But here is where I think Sandra is right: thinking this way you justify everything that is wrong with the hobby, because then is right for the GMs to fudge dice, to cheat the players out of their fun in favour of yours because players don't know what's best for them and the story, it makes Rule Zero the only certain truth about RPGs, it takes away player's agency and blames people complaining about this for ruining the fun in the game.<br/><br/>I don't like one extreme nor the other, I'd prefer to have some kind of line here, even a blurred one. A middle ground where things can be fair and rules unflexible up to a certain point so the game remains a game instead of a make believe that also upholds the "make believe that this is a game where player interaction do changes something". But then I like to have space to come up with things whenever I want/need to, because playing unsafe, relying on the players ideas and following your instincts also makes up for an excellent game experience.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462611/#Comment_462611" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-28T20:09:55+00:00" title="April 28, 2017  8:09PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now, can the trap in the room be invented while the characters are in the hallway but before they enter the room?

I'll butt out afterwards, if it's not welcome.<br/><br/>My experience has been that this is one of those places where the idea of "creative agenda" (or any similar centering/aligning of priorities, whatever you want to call it) is the key to cutting through this kind of debate, both in discussion and in actual play. Having an aligned creative priority gives a group a way to get through such debates and keep making their game as fun and as productive as possible.<br/><br/>Focusing entirely on techniques of play is good, but you can get into the kind of argument we're seeing here: for instance, whether it's acceptable to invent something 10 seconds before they come into play, but not 2 seconds before. This all seems a bit silly to me, and to see people getting heated or upset over it (presumably because they feel like their preferred "fun" is being attacked, a natural human reaction) is really unfortunate.<br/><br/>Of COURSE, in any given game there are things which are prepped and things which are improvised. There's simply no way to play without improvisation at all.<br/><br/>So, how do we know when it's OK to do so, and when it's undesirable or suboptimal?<br/><br/>Looking purely at approaches and techniques only gets you so far, and can eventually bring you to a point where you're so attached to the techniques that they become overwhelming (for example, if you become convinced that the only way to have a fun game is to prep EVERYTHING, or that you shouldn't prep because improvisation is more flexible, or whatever other absolute stance).<br/><br/>I find that focusing on some kind of creative goal or guiding principle can help us all take a breath and relax, and then align our process with that goal.<br/><br/>For example, in Eero's "challenge-based adventuring" paradigm, we adopt a fairly explicit "Gamist agenda": the whole purpose of the game is to challenge the players' cleverness, wits, and ability to judge risks vs. the odds provided by the game itself. We create fiction (sometimes very intense, detailed fiction!), characters, fictional environments, secrets, enemies, and so forth, all in service to this goal.<br/><br/>This kind of insight about the game you're playing immediately allows you to cut through a debate like this, because you can safely consider and discuss any given choice in play and hold it up against the object of our game.<br/><br/>This shows us immediately why it's satisfying to decide what the effects of the mirror are before the PCs even encounter it (because it means more of their earlier choices are lucky guesses or smart risk-taking, and they pay off - or not - appropriately), but why it's totally fine to improvise a dungeon layout, adding a slave pit to a corner (because we're concerned about the characters' ability to defeat the slavers, and the pit is equally advantageous as it is disadvantageous - it's just another tactical feature which a clever combatant might use to their advantage, if they can). <br/><br/>More importantly, it allows us to see why, given a slightly different setup or different player goals, <i>the exact opposite might be true</i>. If improvising the slave pit makes a challenge significantly harder or allows the players to circumvent it altogether, it was an unwelcome addition to the game; we have failed to engage in the challenge fairly. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if revealing the mirror turns out to be entirely irrelevant to the challenges we're dealing with, simply improvising something might be entirely acceptable and even welcome.<br/><br/>We can negotiate these things in real time, as well. That allows us to troubleshoot difficult situations smoothly and without conflict, by embracing our joint commitment to creating and resolving challenges impartially. For instance, I might say, "I haven't determined yet what the effects of the mirror are. Are you committed to the act of pulling off the canvas? If so, I'm going to roll on this random effects table here. Any objections to that?" (And we might negotiate over which random table gets used, if necessary.) Perhaps I already had an idea, but I hadn't settled on it, so I could say, "It's clearly either a demon-trapping mirror, or a scrying mirror. Roll 50/50 to see which it is; if it IS a demon-trapping mirror, however, there will also be a 2-in-6 chance it's currently containing one." This then becomes a precedent for handling such things in the future, as well.<br/><br/>Similarly, I might say, "It occurs to me that a dungeon like this definitely *should* have a slave pit. However, adding it to the layout of the dungeon might make it significantly harder or easier to reach your goals. How should we handle this?" The players might agree to let me think about for a while, because we're all really committed to this particular challenge, and we don't want to sacrifice the integrity of the dungeon map. Then we might spend some more time on other concerns for the rest of the session ("We need to sort out our provision situation, anyway..."), and agree to get back to it next week. <br/><br/>Or we might agree to randomize it somehow, or bow to the judgement of a player knowledgeable about this kind of thing - "Hey, Julie, you started this whole 'slaver dungeon' thing when the campaign began. Where would a slave pit typically be, in this kind of dungeon?" Or we might try some other operation entirely, like adding it in the logical place, but then making a roll to decide where the characters are - to see how advantageous their position is relative to this new addition. A successful Dungeon-delving roll might allow them to choose freely, as though they had known about it before they got to this latest crossroads, whereas a failure might mean they were clueless and wandered past it earlier, missing out on the opportunity.<br/><br/>The point is that the clear guidance of a creative agenda or game object allows us to consider this kind of challenge together and come up with a solution. We know that we want to create interesting challenges and resolve them as impartially as possible, we know that we value certain information over other information (like the concept of "fog of war"), and we know that we want the fiction to remain as coherent as possible (or whatever our actual priorities are in the game; these are just examples). With that kind of collaborative focus on a creative goal, these hiccups no longer form an obstacle we can't easily overcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462638/#Comment_462638" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-29T04:34:52+00:00" title="April 29, 2017  4:34AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WM: Airk had said that you could change it all the way up to the cloth being unveiled.<br/>And yesterday, I thought of a style of play where that would work better \u2014 the "roll to find traps" style of play. Especially ones where DCs are static or deterrmined by the system.<br/><br/>I've already also written about another style of play, the capital-I "Impro" style, where holding off on determining the mirror's effect (if any) to the latest possible moment is not only acceeptable dut even desirable.<br/><br/>So I'm giving charitable interpretations of how going against the best moment I ever had in an RPG (best because it was the first thing that happened, not the only or the last) can be an OK or even a good thing.<br/><br/>But I'm also trying to show that there is one style of play where it's necessary to commit to the mirror's effect before the player characters enter the room, because that's a core part of the resolution system for that game. Just as when you play morra or nigiri, you can't say your number after the number has already been revealed. Obv roll-to-find-traps and build-and-tilt modes of play aren't bound to that principle.<br/><br/>I am being charitable towards those modes of play.<br/><br/>I made sure to explicitly mention the determining the floor trap after play has started, adding an "I guess" not to minimize that way but to indicate that it would be a bit od a side track. But when I came back there were seven posts all about that side track.<br/><br/>So let's talk about that side track: Committing to the trap's trigger mechanism and effect before the player characters enter the room.<br/><br/>That side track has nothing to do with the last week's posts. It's on record that Airk wrote that the mirror's effect could be set when the cloth was removed. And this topic wasn't about your discussion at all, WM, but if you're so eager to drink from the same spoon, here you go: that side track has nothing to do with setting the damage from a Lightning Bolt after the bolt is fired either.<br/><br/>It's a reverse straw man which is one of the weirdest forms of arguing I've ever seen and I have to start thinking that you are only making things up as you go in order to string me along into these ridiculous arguments.<br/><br/>If I was talking to the hypothetical GM who are inventing their traps (both triggers and effects) after play has started but always before the trap has truly entered play, I would have a very different discussion with them (for example, coming up with a floor trap <em>is</em> different after you've seen your players be consistent about checking the floor of every room vs after seeing your players never doing that).<br/><br/>But that's not who I've been talking to.<br/><br/>Saying I'm "maintaining that improvising requires you to make up stuff when the players start interacting with it, instead of making stuff up before that" when<br/>A. I have written post after post about how functional impro usually involves bringing some or a lot of preconceived ideas but holding to those ideas lightly,<br/>B. I'm writing charitably about impro but Airk is writing disparagingly about prep,<br/>C. Making stuff up post-hoc instead of before <em>is</em> improvising, making stuff up before that <em>is</em> prep,<br/>D. Airk has previously explicitly and clearly argued in favor of waiting to determine the mirror's effect (if any) after removing the cloth,<br/>E. I used a couple of my very few sentences in this very thread to acknowledge setting the trap before they entered the room but after play has started<br/><br/>is BULL SHIT.<br/><br/>And capital-I "Impro" when you're creating a story together (Johnstone style) and it's not only acceptable but even desirable to hold off on describing the effects and mechanisms of traps and mirrors isn't a difficult or problematic playstyle iff that's the group activity. I know groups who play that way with great results.<br/><br/>And Airk has now goal-posted his position from being "against prep" to\n<blockquote>Now I'm not saying you can't run a game with full prep if you want to</blockquote> and <blockquote>The mirror needs to have an effect when it enters play, not when it is revealed</blockquote> -- two <em>significant</em> changes from what he has been adamant on before over many posts.<br/><br/>While <blockquote>It's much more sensible to have a least a 100 meter headstart.</blockquote> isn't counter to anything I've been writing about improvisation.<br/><br/><br/>I had an epiphany that day in the dungeon. And yes, the pendulum was swung very far that day: the whole dungeon was completely prepped, the module was written far in advance, the DM and the module writer weren't the same person, neither the DM or the module writer had seen my player character, and the DM had never DM:ed for me before.<br/><br/>And I've been putting in work and making mechanics to find a workable middle ground that still gives some of that tangible feeling even in less fortutious circumstances.<br/><br/><br/>And I'm trying to teach people, here and on other forums and in real life, about this experience and how it differed from the RPG experiences I have had in the past.<br/><br/>And what do I get?\n<blockquote>as you "guess"</blockquote>\nFUCKING SARCASM!<br/>from someone who<br/>1. have been consistently denying <em>any</em> merit of experience (up until now when he's instead saying that that denial is a strawman)<br/>2.

I can't always follow discussions from one thread to another nor remember exactly what and where was written something, nor I really have time to try to track and puzzle all these pieces to have a complete accurate idea of each forum's member current viewpoint on game design.<br/><br/>Not even those with efforts I get interested in and try to follow up to my best.<br/><br/>All I have is the memories of the harsh, polemic or revolutionay things they posted before, if I had the luck to read that post before it went lost in the sea of comments and discussions. I often try not to answer based on this incomplete map but when discussions tend to drag this long and coincidences with this map start to come up it's easy to think "oh, here comes this person again with this usual crap".<br/><br/>Though it looks like I'm not the only one who thinks this way.<br/><br/>Sandra, I don't want to discourage you from trying to educate others in your way of playing. It's admirable that you have gone so long and so far up to the point that it even changed my way of thinking about how I DM. <br/><br/>I have had these epiphanies myself about other aspects of the game and wrote about them time and time again receiving only a limited small welcome and tons of advice and education against things I feel that should be a basic consideration in every RPG (note: things totally outside the scope of the current discussions). I mean, it even got to the point where people here started threads to ask people like me to stop posting about game design ideas! I hadn't felt such heavy, uh, let's call it "blocking", intent since the last days of the Forge when Ron closed any thread about loose mechanics that weren't integrated to an actual full game design document.<br/><br/>When this happened in SG there was enough people defending the right to talk about loose mechanic and design ideas that the ban subject got dropped, but the limited welcome and tons of advice against my ephiphanies happened so consistently that I concluded there was little to no interest and that the unwritten social contract of SG considered unpolite to insist on such endeavours. <br/><br/>And it made sense, I mean, I've never seen here Eero educating us on his way of playing unless somebody asked for it. It wasn't from Vincent that I got into PbtA but from all his fans, same with Jason and Fiasco. So it made sense that if I had these ephipanies and wanted to get people into playing RPGs in a certain way because of how much fun I envisioned there, it was better to design an actual game o a playing aid that took advantage of these ideas and showed the results, instead of trying to convince people with theorethical arguments -though mostly because I suck at theorethical argumentation, I'm not saying it's not a valid avenue.<br/><br/>So in resume, I apologize for blocking so much, I misreaded you, I posted assumming too much based on limited information, felt attacked and got too defensive. Thank you for educating me, I do appreciate it -and this is not sarcasm-, though I would have preferred to be something I asked for instead of something I got into because I wanted to give my opinion on what I thougth was more of a discussion and was more of a classroom instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462658/#Comment_462658" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-29T18:38:52+00:00" title="April 29, 2017  6:38PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2017 10:15PM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk, I apologize to you too.

This is the entire point of a whole host of mechanisms and principles of play in games like <b>Apocalypse World</b> and <b>Blades in the Dark</b>, to bring the GM to a mental state where they can more effectively wear their referee hat in the face of uncertain fiction. You have to be what John Harper calls a <b>curious explorer of the fiction</b> in <b>Blades in the Dark</b>. You need to be motivated to really consider what the fiction would be rather than what you want it to be. You have to <b>advocate for it</b> - not put <b>designs on it</b>.<br/><br/>I mean anyone who is interested in being a referee will need to do this from time to time because it is largely impossible to prep every detail of the fiction before hand. In many cases - like determining what an NPC's response should be to what a PC has just said - being an improvising referee is the best way to effectively respond as a GM because it matches the thought process of the NPC. You just need to take a moment and really consider what the impact would be in the fiction - like in your bones consider it - and put it in the hands of the character.<br/><br/>I also do not think prep is in any way a silver bullet to remove bias, particularly if you know your players well and have time to germinate on things.

I can't meaningfully get upset when I am doing the same thing!<br/><br/>From my vantage point being a referee is not about the tools you choose to use. It is entirely about applying <b>judgment</b> in the face of <b>uncertainty</b>. This is not something we should fear, but a vital part of being a GM in any game. The mechanisms we find in a game like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, or Blades in the Dark are focused on embracing our judgments over fictional positioning - not mitigating their need. Part of the reason we hold on lightly to fictional details is to ensure their coherence in light of the enfolding fiction. <br/><br/>What most Powered By The Apocalypse games do is to provoke us to really think about the fiction, really consider it, and utilize our judgment over the fiction. This extends to other players as much as it does the GM. We are expected to really think about what motivates our characters, what their pasts were like, what they are doing now and what that all means for the fiction - to play with integrity. You do not get to make a move without first establishing fictional positioning. The GM is supposed to regard that positioning when assigning consequences. The 10+ result on go aggro provokes the GM to make a judgment about what the NPC is willing to possibly die for. The targeted questions of read a charged situation provoke the GM to make a judgment about the fiction. It is literally the mechanics speaking to the GM saying <b>be a referee <i>right now!</i></b><br/><br/>Those gaps in the map are not a time where we get to stop being a referee. They are a time where <b>we must be referees!</b> The game tells us it is our <b>duty</b> to <b>really</b> follow the fiction - to be curious explorers.<br/><br/>I do not mean to poopoo on prep here. We need context to make the judgments that allow us to be referees. Prep is one way of establishing that context - making prejudgments rather than judgments. Another way is responding to player interrogation of the fiction. Yet another way is to disclaim decision making at times. <br/><br/>I do think it is a mistake to assume prep can fully obviate the need for judgment or that it will lead to reliably better  judgment than those made in the heat of the moment for all GMs in all situations. I view this as a deeply personal matter that very much depends on our own mental strengths. I personally can not be trusted with too much overt prep. When I do so I have the tendency to become emotionally invested in my prep and fall into a story advocacy trap. During play I am much more focused on the fiction as a living breathing thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462721/#Comment_462721" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T07:30:25+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  7:30AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside: I think dungeon delving is one case where overt prep does tend to be more reliable at least when it comes to things like traps, secret doors, puzzles and the like because they are largely static features. Things like monster behavior, responding to lateral decision making, and like tend to be more authentic when we do not prep for them in my personal experience.

What would be the actual benefits?<br/><br/>There are D&amp;D board games like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/66356/dungeons-dragons-wrath-ashardalon-board-game" rel="nofollow">Wrath of Ashardalon</a> after all that are, well an extreme viewpoint of this idea, but a totally functional one. <br/><br/>My approach would resemble this... perhaps only on the player commitment to a previously discussed game goal. Like "we're on this for the money" or "we want to establish our own kingdom". It can even be staged in two or three parts, like "we want to explore this place first" and a few sessions ahead change the goal to "we want to freed this place from the evil Lich we found three sessions ago". Each agreement to a goal would mean that the GM would prepare in that direction, though not necessarily a railroad. <br/><br/>We could have sandbox hexcrawl procedures and all predefined static physical things like towns, castles and dungeons all pre-designed in their simplest form, plus the necessary descriptions in brief form. We could have a fixed set of DCs to assign to each module, balanced by player level. We could have random encounter tables that we could switch for each module. Most hexcrawls just mark the important predefined locations on the map and leave the rest blank to be filled as the random tables are rolled, so prep could be reduced to a flexible minimum of procedures and tables, while other things receive a more detailed treatment.<br/><br/>Players would have to refrain from straying away from the main goal before certain point, like the limit of the prep or otherwise the GM would need to have a number of possible player choices prepared, but ask the players to somewhat roll with it and keep their choices that narrow or negotiate to leave that path to be explored later, when prep in that direction is ready. <br/><br/>Well, it doesn't have to be this restrictive though, I mean, currently I'm using something like this but I end the session before the party reaches any place that I haven't prepped for. Travelling takes it's time and it's an interesting part of the game by itself: navigating the map, handling the logistics, random encounters for battle, social conflict, opportunities and exploration, etc.  I can use this time to place signals of what's about to come and generate expectation, or better yet, get ideas from the players about what they expect to find.<br/><br/><small>However I wouldn't use D&amp;D for this, mostly because despite the encounter design balancing rules and procedures do somewhat work and aren't impossible to master, they take too much time for me and often become useless when a player doesn't come or when one who had cancelled before suddenly decides to show up with a friend that wants to try playing, often to disappear later. It's not the game's fault but my group's and mine.<br/><br/>For my own games I ended up coming with a simple approach, making PC levels "virtual", meaning that they could level up but their stats wouldn't change too much (either a +1 to an existing skill or item or a new skill/item). NPCs had only 5 actual levels:<br/>-don't roll, PCs narrate how they vanquish these minions when encountered.<br/>-PCs roll with advantage against these enemies<br/>-PCs are in equal terms against these enemies<br/>-PCs roll with disadvantage against these enemies<br/>-Run or die.<br/><br/>So, what happened when PCs level up was that monsters <i>went down a level</i>, thus making these "virtual levels" actually matter. HP nor damage didn't need to escalate so mostly things were about tactics, how skills could be applied on creative ways, doing things by doing them and such. I could either go around the table asking for actions or let the player with the quickest reaction go first, and then the next one, and then ask whoever was being passive for their actions. The mess was actually fun and organic. <br/><br/>Monsters would act whenever players failed a roll <i>a la</i> PbtA and I could have players making more than one attack if it made sense in the fiction somehow. And on a fumble, the monster would use an area attack or some change in the terrain affected all the PCs.  </small><br/><br/>The benefit for the players would be a more competitive, fair and honest kind of challenge, dunno if it would be okay to call it a simulationist CA as the jargon is way old, what's the proper term these days, if there is one?

I think motivation is what matters here - not timing. </p></div></blockquote>\nThe most recent post is one I also agree with, in full.<br/><br/>Sandra,<br/><br/>I don't have any interest in starting a new thread about that tangent, mainly because I don't have any more to say about it. (If you want to start one, I'd be happy to answer questions and such, though!)<br/><br/>It baffles me that you don't see how it is relevant to this conversation, since, in my view, the entirety of the argument/disagreement which is taking place is due to a focus on Techniques, rather than going to the source and looking at the motivation behind the decisions and procedures of play.<br/><br/>In my gaming life - both in discussion and in play - realizing (however implicit the understanding may be) the creative agenda/motivation at work*... <b>means that I never have to have this kind of argument ever again</b>.<br/><br/>That's an enormous benefit to me, and has transformed my enjoyment of gaming in a really dramatic way.<br/><br/>For instance, consider this:<br/><br/>You're unveiling the mirror, and the GM admits they have not determined what it is or what it does. What's at stake here? Are we just curious about what happens next, and what would make most sense (1)? Are the players going to feel cheated if there's no chance their clever attempt does something good for them? Are the players interested in having a legitimate challenge to face? Is the GM having trouble making an impartial decision?<br/><br/>For some of those (e.g. #1), saying, "Ok, we don't know what the mirror does. What can magic mirrors do in this world? We've discussed it a bit before. Let's brainstorm together quickly and make a random table. Then we can use that in the future for all uncertain mysterious items. I think there should be a chance of demonic possession, do you agree?" - would be <i>perfect</i>. <br/><br/>If the players are feeling that they want their earlier decisions to really matter, and worried about a fair adjudication of this challenge, then this solution won't work. The players won't be able to comfortably invent entries for the random table, because they will feel pressure to invent things that are beneficial to them, and that will feel dissonant. Maybe in that case we'll want to pause the session and call our creatively-minded friend to come up with a "random" magic mirror effect, or whatever other thing.<br/><br/>And so forth. Having a clear sense of what we're doing and why immediately allows us to get past this kind of hitch and form a solution which works for everyone.<br/><br/>Another way to look at it:<br/><br/>Yeah, sure, it's awesome when you can prep every little thing, and the players interact with that prep. However, it's impossible to do this for everything in the game. If nothing else, you'll have to make rulings or apply bonuses/penalties when PCs try unexpected things, and that's just as significant.<br/><br/>The success or failure of the game, at that point, depends on your ability to make principled choices in response to players' lateral thinking or unexpected moves, as well as other judgement calls (can a demon jump from a mirror covered with a thin cloth?).<br/><br/>Interacting with prep is <i>awesome</i>. But it doesn't cover all the other situations - you need tools to deal with those, too. Only then are you ready to really have a successful game - and that's where you have to deal with principled improvisation.<br/><br/>How can you do that? I think the best way is to have a clear sense of what the game is for and why you and your group is playing it - what are you trying to get out of this? That's when it all clicks into place.<br/><br/>Imagine a married couple with kids having a terrible fight over their finances. My perspective here is to come in and say, "Hey, remember what your real priorities are here? It's not winning the fight against your spouse: it's loving each other and providing a good home for your children." Take a step back and figure out what you really care about; that's when the argument can finally be resolved. This is the gaming equivalent.<br/><br/>If it's not interesting to you, of course, I have no attachment to forcing it down your throat. I just think it's an obvious way to fix this disagreement, which seems to be frustrating people and causing some heated exchanges. (And equally so *in actual play*  at the table - not just in theoretical discussion.)<br/><br/><br/>*: This has nothing to do with the "GNS Modes", necessarily - I don't necessarily agree with the three recognized modes, but the analysis, in the abstract, remains just as useful. The point is to have some sense of what the group is going for creatively, and lean on that - much like a "mission statement" can help a business venture make difficult decisions, perhaps, or how a Constitution can help a government follow principled rule.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462748/#Comment_462748" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T19:07:14+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  7:07PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think with your very last paragraph, Paul, we can understand each other.

(Or, more relevantly, all the people who have been inspired by his writeups here and have started games based on them after reading?)<br/><br/>For many people - including myself - his Step On Up view of D&amp;D (which I'm using as a shorthand for a whole lot of material, though, and direction) produced precisely the same lightbulb moment you experienced with the "mirror" in your D&amp;D game. Suddenly the game makes sense.<br/><br/>I suspect - but cannot be sure, of course - that people who play in this style but can't see the usefulness of a "Step On Up" mindset are attaching all kinds of other associations to the idea, and <i>those</i> include stuff they don't like in gaming, so they reject the label. I strongly suspect that if they were to play together, they would see that they're doing the same thing, after all, and almost certainly have a great time.<br/><br/>The shorthand is that the players are trying to be clever and to take risks and to pull off meaningful successes. We create a tangible and believable fictional environment for them to set the parameters for these meaningful challenges and successes. The GM uses prep and principled improvisation to set up challenges and then steps back and resolves them as impartially as possible (as an arbiter or referee), which, in turn, enables the players to engage with the challenges in whatever way they like and to enjoy facing them, with a legitimate sense of danger and real outcomes at stake.<br/><br/>The combination makes play feel "real" - the effect is one where the players are set against solid fictional challenges, and outcomes are determined according to what seems believable - "what would happen" - and successes pulled off by the characters feel incredibly meaningful, imparting a real sense of accomplishment. <br/><br/>We all know that the stunt we pulled with the mirror had real impact, because it was a logical outcome of prior decisions (GM's prep + character actions + circumstances of play), and no one can gainsay it. (This is why that effect would be lost if the GM simply improvised something by fiat; it would no longer be grounded in the fictional challenges we have all committed to by engaging in the game.)<br/><br/>Notably, from the GM side, this feels very "Simulationist" because of the techniques she brings to the table, which are all about verisimilitude, consistency, and a "simulation" of outcomes, viewed as an impartial arbiter of the fictional reality. <br/><br/>However, this is belied by the GM creating challenges and rewards in the first place (for instance, if it's a game of D&amp;D, there will almost certainly be monsters, traps, and treasure, or something similar for the players to engage with - we don't spend a session playing out a trip to buy milk at the market unless there is some challenge of accomplishment at stake). We know this is true, because we skip over such minutia unless it's likely to contribute details interesting to other future challenges (e.g. provisioning for a long voyage) or provides a challenge on its own.<br/><br/>I have yet to see a lightning-clear formulation of a Right to Dream gaming philosophy, but I've seen many that have come close, or are at least mostly useful. (On the other hand, some of the Nordic LARP manifestos may do so, depending on how you look at this whole rigamarole.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462758/#Comment_462758" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T19:38:21+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  7:38PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2017 7:53PM by Airk.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra, I explicitly mentioned your "I guess" comment in an effort to head off all this, but yes, I'm right there with WarriorMonk that that phrasing feels extremely dismissive. "Oh, I suppoooose you could do it THAT way..." - as if it is clearly an inferior solution.  Your language feels belittling every time you bring this up, though I felt that this particular example seemed particularly dismissive.  You wrote a super long post with a single sentence addressing my entire stance.  It's why it's so long between my responses to these threads.  I literally toned down my response through four different re-reads and edits an effort to be LESS angry about this.<br/><br/>And I don't feel that I am moving the goalposts at all here.  The trap is "revealed" when it enters play.  Which is to say, when the PCs enter the room with it and potentially start interacting with it, either automatically (by seeing a visible sign of it), intentionally, or unwittingly (stepping on it without noticing it in the process of exploring the room).  You need to know, at that point, if it's a pit trap, or a plate on the floor that teleports you, or what. <br/><br/>I don't really understand why you think the goalposts are being moved - my stance, as far as I can recall, has always been "improv stuff slightly before you need it"; If you are introducing a covered mirror, you need to know what that mirror does when you say "oh, and there's a covered thing, probably a mirror, in the corner" because half the damn time, the next thing that happens is someone saying "I run over to it and yank the cover off!"; It's the same with the trap.  If no one notices it, you'd better have an idea what it does for when they step on it.  but you don't need that information when they're still on the other side of a closed door.  But anytime you introduce an element, you should be introducing it with the expectation that it's going to be interacted with Very Soon, and as a result, you should know how it will be interactable with.  Which means knowing what it is.  I feel like this is the same point I've been trying to make the whole time. Sorry if you feel it's not.  It certainly hasn't been my stance for the last two threads of discussion here.  You were the one who talked about your experience improvising a box and not even knowing if it was a bomb or what, and I distinctly recall thinking that that was a crazy way to try to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462767/#Comment_462767" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T21:11:11+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  9:11PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for taking this slowly Airk and thanks for putting in effort at managing your emotions.<br/>I failed at doing that the other day and I apologize for expressing my anger so rawly.

Of course your decisions matter starting with when you start interacting with the mirror... unless of course you make decisions where it doesn't actually matter what the mirror is at that point... like a lot of the stuff you are describing. A scrying mirror probably doesn't feel any different from a Mirror of Soul Eating or a perfectly normal mirror. Maybe a mirror that's actually a portal to the Plane of Fire might feel different, but if so good luck covering it with a tarp. ;P No, it's not just about the bullywug scene... but the bullywug scene was the first scene in which your decisions about the mirror actually matter, regardless of what has or hasn't been decided about it, so that is the first scene where it's even possible for your choices regarding it to matter.<br/><br/>So close and yet so far. </blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote>Uh, yes, that was my point. The Bullywug scene was when the cards were flipped. But up until that point, you were still free to adjust your bet. :P </blockquote>\nThat mindset was what I was specifically addressing.<br/><br/>I wrote "Now, can the trap in the room be invented while the characters are in the hallway but before they enter the room? I guess." because that was a side-thing to your original statements which were that it didn't actually matter what the mirror was until the tarp was removed.<br/><br/>Now, you are saying things like <blockquote>If you are introducing a covered mirror, you need to know what that mirror does when you say "oh, and there's a covered thing, probably a mirror, in the corner" because half the damn time, the next thing that happens is someone saying "I run over to it and yank the cover off!"</blockquote>\nIf that's how you feel, then that's fantastic! We're on the same page!<br/><br/>What you write now, that you (in some idioms) need to know what the mirror does when you first introduce it as just "a covered thing", is exactly what I have been trying to explain. Two weeks ago you were saying something that I, still upon rereading it, interpret as disagreeing with that.<br/><br/>I was saying: you need to have the mirror's effect set when they enter the room.<br/>You were disagreeing with that.<br/><br/>I was saying: there are some idioms where you need the mirror's effect set when they enter the room and there are some idioms (Johnstone-style Impro) where it's beneficial to not set the mirror's effect until the very last possible moment.<br/><br/>You were disagreeing with that.<br/><br/>Then I started this thread giving a new argument for why there <i>are</i> some idioms where you <i>do</i> need to have the mirror's effect set when they enter the room.<br/><br/>And now you are instead saying: Of course there are, don't insist that improvisers don't set mirror's effects when the room is entered.<br/><br/>If that's what you're saying: OK, good then. Having it recognized and validated that there <i>are</i> some benefits to setting the mirror's effect when the room is entered is what I've asked for for two years.<br/><br/>Now the side topic became how far in advance you have to set it. Weeks in advance or just when they're on the threshold? And whether or not I was dismissive of the "just on the threshold"-method\u2014the point of the "I guess" was that it was a bit beside the point since you hadn't previously been talking about setting it on the threshold, you had been talking about setting it as the tarp was pulled off.<br/><br/>Now it seemed to me that you've moved the goal-post from tarp to threshold. If you re-read your quotes in this post, can you understand why? They really do give the impression that you were arguing for not setting the mirror's effect until the tarp was removed. Even if that wasn't what you meant, can you understand how they really, really read that way?<br/><br/>And sure, we can talk threshold; that's an interesting side topic but first the tarp topic needs to be resolved and buried.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462771/#Comment_462771" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T21:40:37+00:00" title="May  1, 2017  9:40PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I deliberately left my issues with Step On Up and Right to Dream unsaid.

We know this is true, because we skip over such minutia unless it's likely to contribute details interesting to other future challenges (e.g. provisioning for a long voyage) or provides a challenge on its own.</p></div></blockquote>\nI've experienced strong resistance from my players and unease in myself in skipping over such minutia.<br/><br/>However, we've skipped over routine (repeated) parts both slice-of-life and in the dungeon. Consider BW's "beliefs"&gt; "We always check the ceiling before we enter any room". Scripted Standard Order of Procedure. Now checking the ceiling for Spider-Things is far from mundane. But we only need to play it out so many times. Same goes for buying milk. We roll for a (very low prob) "did something happen at the market that week and if so what day" once we've done it a couple of times.<br/><br/>When God created the tree she made all the leaves similar. When God created the leaf she made all the little veins similar. When God created the little veins in the leaf, she made all the cells similar. And the atoms in the cells and so on. That's how she got it done in seven days, she used Lisp and set up efficient macros.<br/><br/>When we play an RPG we can zoom in and out of time. We can slow time down and speed it up, focus what we want to see, what we're curious about. Buying milk at the market in the diegetic culture is very interesting. But we don't need to do it 16 times. There are other interesting things to see.<br/><br/>A friend of mine ran a campaign in a contemporary setting where the players were playing ordinary people going to a vacation in a summer house. They were playing how they moved into the house, how the kitchen looked, they were doing slice of life there. Several sessions had passed when I heard from them about this (not sure what happened after this because he broke it off with another friend of mine so I lost contact with him). The players were loving it. They were thinking something was going to happen, some sort of supernatural horror or non-supernatural crime drama. But they didn't know for sure that something like that was going to happen. And they were enjoying roleplaying out these coffee-sessions on the porch, these blue wooden walls in the kitchen in that summer house in the SIS.<br/><br/>Now, you mention monsters, traps and treasure. The challenge element of these are very appealing, that's right. But there are other appealing things about them. They create danger and they create uncertainty and they create conflict and they create drama.<br/><br/>Traps also are a strong affordance for investing in the SIS. If you play out a trip to the market to buy milk, you don't roleplay out every step taken, every muscle in the foot how it feels in that wooden dutch clog. But when you're in a trapped dungeon, you often <em>do</em> care about every step and describe it carefully.<br/><br/>Treasure is also a big stirring the pot of the status quo. The characters will have different circumstances and different possible choices after having their wealth increased or decreased.<br/><br/>Stepping on up is appealing, and challenge -- though no guarantees of a particularly fair or even possible challenge -- is a pleasant part of the game and a part I hope to keep. However, there are <em>so many</em> aspects to these games that I find appealing. I can't reduce it to <em>just</em> Step On Up.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462777/#Comment_462777" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-01T22:25:10+00:00" title="May  1, 2017 10:25PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2017 10:28PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that within the general play style of no-railroad, impartial ref GMing, there's room for specific play styles with specific requirements on prep.  Some allow the GM to determine the reality of the fiction as needed in the moment, others a little in advance, and still others way in advance.  Sandra's specific style rewards her more for operating toward the "way in advance" end of the spectrum.  Airk's doesn't.  Mine doesn't either, but I do get the gist of why Sandra's does, even if I don't understand it down to every last detail.  <br/><br/>My hunch is that the disconnect here has arisen from talking about two (or more) different things as if they were one thing.

The word is <i>simulation</i>. Redefining for the purposes of the thread, it means that the game we're playing is trying to capture certain aspects of reality. Maybe not all, maybe not more than once, but after all your motivation to enforce certain techniques is to obtain something closer to certain real world feelings. In this case, real uncertainty. The feeling that a challenge was real, that things existed long before you reached that place and that every choice that took you to that place interacted with the prep to create something more akin to a real situation. With unforeseen consequences.<br/><br/>I mean, when I first heard the word on the Forge it sounded kind of unfeasible for me to have fun with that. It didn't even looked as a popular agenda for games post forge anyway. But the more and more I read about your experience, the more that word makes sense.<br/><br/>For me and it seems for Airk and Paul too, our fun seems to be so far removed from there that most of the actual benefits of your playstyle simply can't be conceived by our minds. We don't need the real-life uncertainty this much. That's why it feels more convenient and reasonable for us to make up things as they are needed, being the time to create these "T-1x", where T is the moment it gets framed on scene and x any measure of time, like a second, a minute, an hour, a day, a year, or an instant. For us the amount of exact time is irrelevant, which is why Airk and I seem to be changing idea about how much time before using the thing is "the right and proper way to achieve true legal uncertainty" - the answer for us will still be "anytime"<br/><br/>I believe it's key to get an idea of Sandra's playstyle to grasp this vital element of her agenda: the need to recreate that feeling of fair uncertainty. The GM must know the mirror is there and what it can do because the more the players approach to it, the more excitement it generates for the GM, which seems to get transmitted to the players subconsciously if I'm reading her accounts correctly. That communication is so clear for her group now that if that minutiae isn't addressed they can feel it, as well as the vibes that something is actually there. It's almost like, while Sandra can perfectly Impro like us, she can't transmit the same vibes that communicate that the thing is "real", that interacting with it will bring consequences.<br/><br/>Am I getting closer by any chance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol" title="Jonathan Nicol"><img alt="Jonathan Nicol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20Nicol">Jonathan Nicol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462786/#Comment_462786" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T04:09:45+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  4:09AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is one of those things where we often confuse methods, aims, and results. I am of the opinion that the methods that will result in achieving our aims are deeply personal and very much depend on the vagaries how our minds process information. I am very much concerned with real-life uncertainty and what Sandra calls <b>tangibility</b>. Her specific methods often fail to achieve those aims <i>for <b>me</b></i>.<br/><br/>I find that when I play or run a game where prep is a significant component that play often drifts to engaging with the prep rather than the fiction and fictional positioning. It becomes something of a mind game between the GM and the other players rather than a game about a dynamic fiction. When the GM is deeply invested in the fidelity of the fiction and actively advocating for it I find play more tangible with a hefty degree of improvised content. When I run a game I find that making judgments in the moment is more likely to result in real-life uncertainty than the biases that rise to the surface when I prepare concrete fiction.<br/><br/>For my interests and the way my mind works the best way to achieve real-life uncertainty is for us all to lack certainty and for the tension at the table to be real for all of us. I mean a certain degree of concrete prep and establishing of the fiction is necessary to provide a context for referee decision making, but it matters what that prep is.<br/><br/>I am also weird in that things like maps, concrete distances, and the like result in a game that often feels intangible to me - less like being part of the fiction and more like X-Com, Diplomacy, Starcraft and Civilization in feel to me. I tend not to process visual information so concretely in my day to day life so it feels more like a tactical overlay to me. That's fine when I play a game like B/X or Stars Without Number because I am looking more for a tactical overlay when I play those games than a tangible experience.<br/><br/>The games that feel the most tangible to me tend to rely on a lot more abstraction and GM judgment - Exalted 3e, Apocalypse World, Masks, Edge of the Empire, Chronicles of Darkness.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462787/#Comment_462787" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T04:28:07+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  4:28AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2017 7:08AM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk, you might be right. When I was looking for the way to play that was right for me, I heard about simulationists and thought it was going to be incredibly boring. Historical research, cube roots, and endlesss math. And sure, it's been some of that.<br/>But there's also been interesting magical kingdoms and long hours spent in gothic castles. The word I want for it is "tangibility". I can lift up a pebble and toss it in the creek and it makes a splash.<br/><br/>Not because we would use some rule that calculates the speed in which the pebble would hit the water and how big the splash would be. But because we imagine that the pebble hits the water. We imagine that the grass is under our feet.<br/><br/>That's one of the miracles of finchian trap finding. The tangibility of it. We pour water from our skins to see if there's a trap door. We see how it turns some of the sand to mud but it doesn't seem to drain away. We take a wooden pole and make a line in the mud. Etc etc<br/><br/>This didn't require any calculations or research. Or even a lot of prep. "The floors throughout the dungeon are stone unless otherwise listed. The first twelve rooms have a thin layer of sand as the lizardmen have been coming and going through the desert."<br/><br/>I improvised games for 15 years. I was unaware of the Forge's techniques and of Johnstone, but we discovered a couple of them on our own.<br/>But when I had the mirror experience, I had this sensation. "Tangibility." When I started running dungeons myself, too.<br/>And I don't know the key. What causes it.

I didn't get the vibe you're describing now from your earlier descriptions of your games - not at all. It does, indeed, sound like a Step On Up label would seem ill-fitting, or constrictive, for what you're looking for.<br/><br/>When I look at or think about this style of play, I always come back to:<br/><br/>Where does the fun come from? <br/><br/>Which bits of play do we skip over or summarize? Which ones to do we zoom in on?<br/><br/>The focus on - for instance - trap-finding and other D&amp;D staples does suggest that challenge, threat, and player performance is a major part of that. It's possible, of course, that it's the other way around, as you're suggesting: the reason you like the trap-finding is not because you care about the outcome, but because you like the focus the tension it creates it brings to play. Much like a near-death experience in real life, here the threat of terrible things happening is bringing details, colours, and sensations to greater light, to a greater intensity.<br/><br/>It sounds a bit muddled to me, but that's because most of your descriptions of play have all been about more typical "adventure-challenge" stuff. For instance, it was the use of a mirror in a fight which brought on your "lightbulb" moment, not a quiet scene where a character lay on the grass and your described the feeling of the sun on their closed eyelids.<br/><br/>To bring it back to the topic being discussed, the former example relies much more heavily on the usefulness or prep and impartial arbitration than the latter - which is, in fact, likely much better suited by improvisational GMing and play.<br/><br/>Interesting, in any case. It's one of those things that could never really be figured out in an online discussion, I would think, so all we can do is blabber about and make wild guesses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462795/#Comment_462795" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T07:27:06+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  7:27AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, we crossposted so I missed your post at first. Yes, very interesting and I tried to cede ground to you in the new version of RISS, 1.4. This isn't meant as a slight against other improvisers, I guess Jonathan just writes in a way that I have an easier time understanding.<br/><br/>The following excerpt of the new version would be considered heresy to prior versions of RISS, if it weren't for the official, canonical status of version 1.4.\n<blockquote>generational like \u201cRoll on this table every time a player searches a strangers pockets to see what they find\u201d</blockquote>\nPaul: So let's examine some aspects of the mirror scene. I've had sun-on-eyelid\u2013moments in games before (in Cthulhu Gaslight, I'd go "What does it smell like in here?", "How does the floor feel?" and the like) and that didn't trigger the same lightbulb. The mirror's danger:<br/>\u2022 afforded careful navigation of the SIS<br/>\u2022 required careful adjudication of that navigation<br/>\u2022 created specific consequences from that adjudication<br/><br/>That came together to make the SIS become more real and tangible.<br/><br/>The mirror's danger also provide a challenge element. And that's an appealing element. But not the only element or a particularly necessary one.<br/><br/>The danger in and of itself... well, it's become apparent in my play with that group (this isn't the group where I'm DM) that we aren't challenge oriented. We're into exploring the dungeon and finding out what's in there but we also bring our own characters and their issues.<br/><br/>My last character, Mukoi, was a sort of religious character. My temple had assigned me a "dakli" (which means "burden" in Mukoi's language), and I was to be that dakli's confessor and protector. I was strictly pacifist and used all my spells on protecting my dakli. The spells wore off as soon as the dakli attacked, and the dakli's player wanted to attack but still wanted to keep the protection so there was tension there. I followed them (along with the rest of the party) on my bare feet into the dungeon, with no inventory except my magical metal bowl of wooden pearls, my longbow, and only one arrow.<br/><br/>We were just doing a dungeon crawl one shot to test out a B/X-inspired clone, no wilderness just "The game starts outside of the dungeon" so the rest of the world was left blank. I created Mukoi's religion and asked if any of the other players would volunteer to be my dakli, otherwise I would choose one randomly. A couple of players wanted to do it so I chose the one who said it first.<br/><br/>There were no "blanks left" inside the dungeon itself. It was prepped. It was up to us to explore it. Ally with some monsters and fight others. I ended up getting transformed into a goat by a misfired spell. It was a great session and the dungeon felt very alive.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462796/#Comment_462796" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T07:33:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  7:33AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So elements of all four corners were there.

The challenge element of Skillfrotz was there, we solved the puzzles in the dungeon and survived some fights. Railgnusto; not really. I did have some story beats in mind but I held them lightly and they didn't come to pass. It's possible that the dungeon designer (who was not present at the table) also had story beats in mind and I can't tell if they did or not, and if they did, whether they came to pass or not.

We could play in this dungeon, it was our adventure area, we started chopping down a tree to make a raft but abandoned it after a few hours and entered by foot instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462805/#Comment_462805" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T15:19:34+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  3:19PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aaaahh, so that was it! <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>Wow, it took a while and there seems to be much more things in your playstyle, but it's finally getting clear, at least for me. It's amazing how the intricacies of RPGs, of human perception and mental processes keep us surprised!<br/><br/>It like, two people who like ice cream but finally finding out they like it for different reasons, that the same exact thing is perceived differently by both and their mind processes the sensations based on different things. They could both share the same agenda: cool off, feed themselves some sugar, spend a moment with someone - but the way their minds perceive the same moment, taste and temperature are different, they are focusing on different things at the same time, even when both are enjoying it in the same degree.<br/><br/>Tangibility is a somewhat tricky word here. I mean, we all could say that the fictional world<br/>feels tangible for us, that it has a degree of uncertainty and that the danger is real. And we could even be sharing the same agenda! But the reasons why the fiction feels tangible for us and the mind processes/amount of prep/Impro/techniques we use to get there will be completely different. Because we are focusing on different aspects of the fictional world that "feel real and alive" for us.<br/><br/>For example, my experience with detailed prep is that it's a sacrifice I'm doing as a GM to make the world feel more real to the players, because for me to feel the experience of a world being explored knowing what we will find there defeats the purpose. Later I read a bit of "Play Unsafe" and realized I could improvise lots of stuff, leave blanks and share the exploration experience with the players. Since then I can play without knowing what's going to happen and this feeling of uncertainty is what makes the fictional world more real for me.<br/><br/>As a player, it's not like the GM is always sharing with us their prep procedures as it isn't the point of the game to get to know that. What we care about as players is the result. If the scene framing is good and clear, if challenges appear balanced (as in frighteningly difficult some times and suspiciously easy now and then), if our choices and efforts do change something, if consequences narrated feel reasonable, if the whole process creates exciting/shocking/hilarious moments and everybody is having fun, then the world feels alive and we are okay with/prefer not to look behind the DMs screen and risk breaking the illusion. I mean, even if we knew for sure / found out everything was prepped, that doesn't add anything (for us) to the experience, it just tells us something about the GM persona.<br/><br/>Going back to my GM experience, I have lots of memory issues. I can't memorize my prep unless I prepare like if I'll have an exam next day. And make really concise and complete notes (it's another way to help me memorize stuff) which is something I hate about 5e: I have to keep interrupting myself to check my prep and remember what was supposed to be in that room, then I have to think a way to properly narrate that. And then look at the players faces and recite it by memory while trying to infuse it with the proper emotions I want to transmit about the place! Arrrrgh!, it's so slow and frustrating that the most enjoyable moments are either when I remember the prep and/or when I fill the blanks with Impro. Which in D&amp;D I end up regretting because when I check up the rules and numbers it turns out the great scene and challenge I just framed is totally unbalanced and the players will die without a real chance of changing anything because of all this.<br/><br/>I mean, okay, players can tolerate a few moments of prep checking and rules searching, I do delegate things, they do help me with that, but roleplaying is a conversation which I'm taking forever to answer with 5e, so I can't blame them when they pick up their smartphones while I'm desperately searching for the proper way to keep the conversation going. Brrrr, it kinda reminds me of the worst dates I had when I was a teen, when I look at it like that! <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/><br/><br/>That's why I'm most comfortable and feel the world more tangible when conversation is fluid, when I can keep all players on the edges of their seat and I don't have to worry about the session as if it were an exam, nor about juggling lots of numbers on my mind while trying to come up with an interesting engagin character. And specially when I don't need to stop everything to make sure I'm being fair. I love 5e but it still seems not to be my thing anyway, so I'm most probably returning to the design table for the next system I'll use for our upcoming campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462806/#Comment_462806" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-02T16:09:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2017  4:09PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Later I read a bit of "Play Unsafe" and realized I could improvise lots of stuff, leave blanks and share the exploration experience with the players.</p></div></blockquote>\nYes.

I mean, that was us and this is you, and that's okay. We could be sharing the same agenda and using the same techniques yet what we perceive, what we focus on, what we enjoy from this and how our minds process it is what makes our games completely different!<br/><br/>For example, it never occurred to me (and possibly to Airk and Paul neither) that a GM could get excited by knowing that something can happen and that players are closer and closer to it, and yet the GM doesn't know how could things turn out - which just makes it twice as exciting! Add to this the fact that it's fair. If you're a person who naturally feels uncomfortable when lying to your players and no rationalization/stronger drive around it makes you feel any better, playing like this totals a liberating experience.<br/><br/>It's not as this way of thought is strange or counter intuitive; as a matter of fact explained like this it looks fully natural, rational, intuitive and fun on top of being more socially acceptable. The GM doesn't need to, but CAN be open about her prep, because it's a clean work. Here both player and the GM can feel proud of both what they accomplish or not. Like if you actually had travelled to the Everest IRL and couldn't made it to the top because or weather or a strained ankle. There's no guarantees IRL that you will get to the top, no nice GM that will let you get there and pretend bad weather didn't happen or that your ankle perfectly healed overnight. Because that's what real life challenges are all about. If you get back you can say 'I got to the top' or 'We got THIS close' and still be proud of the results.<br/><br/>The gameplay I use still achieves this but pays different costs. As with yours you need a more precise prep and be able to memorize enough, apply it quickly, juggle the numbers etc. and you're okay with it, I'm okay about going Impro, focusing on the effect, changing my mind on the track, following the players more closely, as well as being comfortable rationalizing around any lie I may end up telling, on top of never telling too much about which parts are prepped and which not. What we get in exchange are positive player emotions, amplified and shared. That's where our fun comes from, that's why what was fair and when was conceived isn't our main interest, and rationalizing around the lied and denial needed to get there is both painless and efforless.<br/><br/>So, techniques, CA and the rest of the theory is all right, but which part of it actually engages with these different perspectives on the different feelings and inner focus on the mind of the GM and the players?<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462833/#Comment_462833" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T00:35:51+00:00" title="May  3, 2017 12:35AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno if this has changed over time, but I remember getting the impression a while back that the "running a simulation" aspect was really important in your GMing, Sandra.  I think one of the ways we (meaning you and me and many others) as GMs "play to find out" is by treating some substantial parts of the gameworlds, which the rules generally allow us to control, as inviolate and <i>outside</i> our control.  I imagine this is part of why unbiased prep is so important for your style -- it allows you to run the experiment without having your sense of "finding out" threatened by any sense of "making it up".  That's how I am, anyway (though different techniques get me there).<br/><br/>So, I dunno, possibly one more point of clarification with which to puncture some communication barriers?<br/><br/>Separately, I wonder what it'd be like to GM a game where the rules put certain traditionally-GM-controlled things outside the GM's control.  Like, "You can <i>never</i> invent an artifact's powers/properties, you <i>have to</i> roll for them."  It might be annoying for a GM who's having accustomed freedoms taken away, but it might also point to where the fun of discovery lies.  "In <i>this</i> game, I get to be surprised by what magic items fall into the PCs' path, and which NPCs are deceitful, and [etc. etc.]!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462836/#Comment_462836" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T03:21:51+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  3:21AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's a great point.<br/><br/>However, as far as I can see, Sandra doesn't consider "rolling for stuff" to be a form of improvisation, for some odd reason. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(To be fair, you could argue that if you're rolling on random tables that are prepared ahead of time, there's an element of prep involved... but that really depends on what kind of tables you are using and how - and, more importantly, you can't then turn around and make the argument that your fiction was coherent up to this point, since you *just rolled for that thing*.

You're right to clarify here that the je ne sai quois of having some inviolate facts as a hard landscape was the point, rather than creating the ultimate Sim City With Swords.<br/><br/>Paul: I consider consulting and trusting the gloracle very, very different from the DM making it up in the moment.

And a really strange thing is that while I'm not, as I stated before, a numbers person, I've got a really good grasp at statistics, replacing what others call and use as 'intuiton'. It's useful and emotionless enough that I can consistently mix it with my custom random tables to guide my Gloracle into a more efficient engine, regulated by my empathy with the player group.<br/><br/>Ways to process information can be completely different from person to person. I've got people more number-oriented in my group, that get excited and see a living town in a spreadsheet full of numbers, where I usually only get a headache. The same person got an actual literal headache when I told him "imagine we throw a pinch of sand in the air, freeze it's motion before it falls to the ground, and then rotate all the coordinates of each grain of sand around a common vertical eccentric axis so each one describes a circle..." -I couldn't finish the phrase because he had to step out of the room to take a breath.<br/><br/>Being a comic artist, I got extremely surprised to work once with a really good writer that wasn't able to come up with actual mental images of his descriptions. Even among comic artists I've found lots of people that have problems thinking in 3d while drawing and others who can't stop thinking in 3d and take advantage of the fact that the page is 2d to stylize parts of their drawing. And they all are great artists despite their shortcomings.<br/><br/>This is because for each thing you can't do directly, you can twist your mind a bit and find a way around it, getting similar results to other people. Be as enthusiastic as you want about how your method is straight or convoluted, how easy it is to learn and use once you understand the principle and how well balanced are it's benefits against it's cost. And yet you will find people that even understanding how it works and caring about the benefits, won't be able to use it because their minds process things in different ways.<br/><br/>This isn't however, reason enough not to explain and tech about your discoveries. We're still talking here about 10% of whoever hears you, that will definitely hate, never use and won't get anything out of your findings, while the rest of the people will at least use it partially and a good 40% will probably adopt it happily and wonder how did they lived without it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

content when it comes to the sort of play I most enjoy the Play Unsafe and <b>capitol-I Improv</b> techniques are not generally of much use to me. I consider blocking and the idea that we get to mess with each other's stuff to be a crucial feature of the underlying tension of the moment that makes playing the game exciting. What I tend not to be in favor of is <b>negation</b> after the moment of resolution. You have all the opportunity in the world to block while fictional positioning is being established. Once something has been firmly established in the fiction I am of the belief that only actions taken in the fiction can negate it.<br/><br/>I am also not opposed to prep. I think prep can be important. The question for me is not - to define or not? It is - what do we define beforehand and how committed should we be to it? What should be tangible? What should be intangible until the moment?<br/><br/>In the sorts of play I prefer it is not all that important for physical space to be tangible until we interact with it. What I want to be most tangible is characters, their relationships to places and other people, and their desires. This applies to both player characters and NPCs. I'm not like opposed to maps, and will sometimes prepare them depending on the game. Relationship maps are more crucial to me. This probably says something about how I approach the world being a deeply social creature and all.<br/><br/>In terms of what we are playing to find out these are all important to me:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I: Play to find out what story our storytelling chemistry creates when we get together<br/>S: Play to find out what concretely, solidly, tangibly <em>happens</em><br/>S: Play to find out who wins, and how<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI favor playing to find out what happens the most. The other two are still important and I vacillate back and forth on what it most important to me in the moment. Rails are a distinctively negative feature most of the time for me. If I want to be told or tell a story rather than experience one I tend to find other mediums far more enjoyable and immersive.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462850/#Comment_462850" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T16:30:45+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  4:30PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agree with that last part                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462886/#Comment_462886" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-03T21:21:24+00:00" title="May  3, 2017  9:21PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an idea, and a thought experiment.

Which is to say, when the PCs enter the room with it and potentially start interacting with it ...</p></div></blockquote>\nI think Sandra has a different idea of when the trap enters play than Airk does!<br/><br/>For Sandra, the trap entered play when she -- <i>a player with a GM role</i> -- put it into the fiction, that is, when she prepped it.<br/><br/>For Airk, the trap entered play when the players learn about it. In Airk's case, the GM's knowledge about the world is not in the fiction yet until it is revealed to players.<br/><br/><b>This is a deeply philosophical divide about what is represented by the idea of "the Fiction" (or The Shared Imagined Space, or whatever).<br/></b><br/><br/>I can see both sides of this. <br/><br/>On one hand, if it's only in the GM's head, it isn't shared, so who cares? Until it's shared, the players don't know about it and it <i>literally doesn't exist yet</i>.<br/><br/>Except it exists in the GM's mind, right? The <i>techniques</i> we use to put stuff into the fiction absolutely matter, or we wouldn't debate this stuff. <br/><br/>Here's another way of looking at it. Say you give your D&amp;D 5e character the Arcana skill proficiency. You don't use it for the first five games, but it's written on your character sheet. Only you know it's there. On the sixth game, you need History, which you <i>don't have proficiency in</i>, so you SWITCH IT. <br/><br/>Is that cheating? Why? Why not? If it's cheating, why is it okay for the GM to switch stuff?

Great point, Adam.  When I as GM show the players the rooms of my cursed ziggurat, it is a very different experience for me if I already know what's there than if I don't, even if the player experience turns out to be identical.<br/><br/>For me, the details of the ziggurat don't actually become real when I jot them down in my notepad.  My creative prep process sometimes distinguishes between "this is what absolutely exists in this place in the setting" and "this <i>might</i> exist", but sometimes it doesn't.  Accordingly, my prep tends to become real when the players commit to interacting with the nearest edge of it.  So, in this case, it's when they commit to going to the ziggurat.  At that point, I know the reality of that thing they're going to.  If, on the other hand, they might <i>never</i> go there?  Then the ziggurat in that location might settle in my mind, or it might not.  The parts I was most excited about might get repurposed for another place or time.<br/><br/>I am disappointed when I prep something which the players never see, so this is part of my process for managing that.  ("Play through what you've prepped, finish, determine what next session will contain, then prep that," has never worked for my "get caught up in the fiction and follow where it takes you in the moment" style of play.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462895/#Comment_462895" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T04:30:55+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  4:30AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it's fair to continue to argue against Airk when he's taking a break from the thread and from the site.

It's just that I don't know some of the details yet until somebody asks or answers my questions. I'm there with the players, I'm just the player that notices first what's there, like when kids start playing "the floor is made of lava, watch out!" - I'm the first kid yelling it.<br/><br/>Also, much of the reasoning behind "the GM must prep and be fair to that prep, as players are expected to be fair to whatever they wrote down on their character sheet" is based in seeing the GM and player roles as simetric in agency and responsability. Not saying that they can't be, but depending on the GM, the group and the gaming style this can work in favor or against the game flow.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm okay if a player changes a skill that she hasn't used yet and finds useless for the current campaign. Though I admit that that time the player asked for it <i>openly</i> while when I GM I'm rarely open with my procedures on the spot (I leave that for discussions after the game or other situations). We have played before with the GM openly asking to change the prep, discussing it with the players and being obvious about the fact that it's being invented on the spot. We kinda get used, but it was and still is so immersion breaking that now we conceal it a bit, ask the questions to the players in character or make no further questioning nor comment about the issue. It would be the equivalent to the kid that says -... but the floor isn't lava. To which we would all reply "it's a game (of let's pretend), come on!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462931/#Comment_462931" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T20:02:45+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  8:02PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2017 8:04PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>soon afterwards, all the newly discovered corridors were littered with pits that we could get over on foot but not easily with our cart.

And that mirror story really is an interesting, engaging textbook example deserving to be remembered and used.<br/><br/>For my part, I'm glad the word "<b>to commit</b>" has finally entered this conversation, a dozen or so posts up-thread! It's been on my mind since halfway through the parent topic to this one, though I couldn't manage to chime in.<br/><br/>How I see it overall:<br/>(My "theoretical framework", if you care, is as defined in 1st edition AW - I haven't carefully read 2nd edition yet - which I believe to be the state-of-the-art Forge textbook. Thus, RPGs as conversations, turns which don't feel like turns, and simultaneously RPGs as games, with an object you make moves towards. That kind of stuff.)\n<ul><li>In strictly Forgite terms, the SIS is by definition shared: a social, conversational thing. There is no committing to it except by saying something aloud, for everybody to hear, of course. That's your move, and as it changes the state of the "board", you can't take it back. Note, though, how this just means "that's the object of Forge theory" rather than "nothing else matters". Of course there's more which matters! Here, we're discussing something which does matter to game-play but actually happens <i>before</i> all the SIS stuff.</li>\n<li>It is entirely possible to mentally commit to your move, in advance of actually making (speaking) it. As everybody appears to agree upon in this thread, this isn't just desirable on a GM's part, but it can in fact be required for a satisfying, functional game to happen, depending on what its object is. <i>How far</i> in advance depends on the object of the game and other techniques. Accordingly, <a href="/forums/profile/2097%27s">@2097's</a> enjoyment of the magical mirror scenario depended on knowing that the GM had already committed to the mirror's properties <i>before</i> the bullywugs uncovered it, even if - technically speaking - that's the moment the GM made their move.</li>\n<li>A significant peculiarity of games with a "traditional" GM role, compared to games where everyone is on more equal footing, is that - unlike other players - a GM has a lot of stuff to mentally juggle, including committing to moves they won't be able to visibly make until later, or they might never be able to make, making the trapped mirror scenario somewhat typical. Another peculiarity of many (though not all) such games is that other players tend to phrase their moves as implicit or explicit questions, with the GM or group consensus needed to validate them as "final" moves, while the GM's moves are self-validating. Sum up those and it follows that it takes significant mental discipline for a GM to distinguish between their already-committed-to but not yet implemented moves and mere musings for possible future moves, and to honor their own commitments... It may feel futile at times, as everything is happening within their own mind only.</li>\n<li>A special case of the above is when a "traditional" GM is decidedly committed to an <i>outcome</i> and, in order to achieve that, treats anything else as comparatively noncommittal. A GM who's committed to the PCs surviving the fight, for example, might make the mirror magical and cursed/trapped on the spot <i>specifically in order to</i> kill some bullywugs and give the PCs a break. As long as this doesn't contradict any previous move (actual move, as in publicly manipulating the SIS: like, a PC magic-user casting Detect Magic and the GM telling them the mirror isn't magical) this doesn't even count as cheating: it's well within the scope of the GM's legal moves. Depending on the game, it may run against some GMing <i>principle</i>, though, or be a breach of social contract.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat I'd most like to point out is: according to the above not all <b>prep</b> is the same. There are different kinds of prep, namely:\n<dl>\n<dt>Noncommittal prep</dt> <dd>You prepare a toolbox to use during the game. Lists of names, items and stuff are just an example such tool. Writing random event tables can be seen as an instance of noncommittal prep too: commitment to an event only happens when you roll on the table and make a move accordingly, to start disclosing what the new event is.</dd>\n<dt>Committal prep</dt> <dd>When you write something down, you commit to it. It feels to you like a game move you're making and failing to honor that commitment would be like taking back a move. In AW (1e) Fronts, it's an act of commitment to write down a Stakes question: you commit to only finding out the answer through certain methods which aren't entirely under your exclusive control, as opposite to just dictating the answer by fiat.</dd>\n</dl>\nNoncommittal prep doesn't have to be sketchy, nor does Committal prep have to be detailed and exhaustive.<br/>I'm not sure a "middle ground" is even possible, but I do believe <b>mixed</b> prep to be common - where some elements are mere tools while others have been committed to in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462958/#Comment_462958" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T23:20:13+00:00" title="May  4, 2017 11:20PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a>, thanks.

It means very much to me.<br/><br/>Yeah, I got a couple of things tangled up. I'm generally a suspicious person, I've played board and card games with the same friend for the last seven years but we still avoid games like Roll For The Galaxy where accountability is difficult. If it's "don't play with people you can't trust", then I can't play any games. <a href="http://adamcadre.ac/if/photopia.html" rel="nofollow">Even video games can have illusionism.</a><br/><br/>That, combined with all my efforts into Transparency of Method. All of those hypermedialized intrusions makes the game a lot less immersive. But I chose that route because my players had been playing with all sorts of 90:s style GMs prior. (Including me.) If you have a GM you can fully trust, you can play CoC with them with your character sheet behind the screen and they'll roll the dice, hide away the math and numbers, and follow the dice results and rules and damage etc completely honestly, and you can have a very immersive experience. But as I and Guy say, it's not always that easy to get to that trust level.<br/><br/>When things are this close to the bone for me, and also this tangled up with each other, it's perhaps me that should avoid the conversation rather than you, David.<br/><br/>As an aside, "If you're going to [suspect me], then just keep playing with whichever previous GM actually <i>was</i> a dick." doesn't really make logical sense. If I was OK with playing with them, then why would I care about that type of moves, and why would I then harbor any suspicion? Obv I'm not OK keeping playing with them.<br/><br/>Also, there are many reasons why someone would add that sort of pits. The "dick" reason is obvious: to shoehorn the progression to their preconceived notion of what would be appropriate for any sort of misguided game balance or dramatic reason.<br/>But it could also be based on a well-meant sense of challenging the players, a la the "earseeker" arms race, or challenging them creatively. "You're so clever coming up with that cart? I love it! But we've played with it for a couple of weeks, let's see what you can come up with next once I've introduced these pits!"<br/>To be clear, I do disagree with those "well-meaning" moves, they're counter to my kicks in this solid stone dungeon.<br/><br/>As a (pretty relevant) aside, let me mention why the campaign ended. The campaign premise was that when a PC dies, the player gets a new level 1 character. But after a couple of deaths and TPKs, there simply wasn't enough easily accessible gold for us to level up enough to handle the more difficult areas. We had scoured it all, leveled up to level 4, then died. (And, that last TPK session was pretty brutal, there was a new player in the group and I did not get along with him. He killed one of my PCs.) So the DM didn't know what to do and still keep it to the original campaign premise. That's the opposite of "adding well-meaning pits"; a harder restock of monsters and gold could've solved the problem but broke the credibility "dream".<br/><br/>David, we're cool, OK?<br/>We can agree to disagree on this one. I think it's a pretty difficult and nuanced topic and I'm trying various methods to rebuild, recreate, re-earn trust and buy-in in the notion of the dungeon as real. There this old TSR recording where they give an example of how it can sound\u2026 and you can hear how much the players <i>believe</i> in the dungeon. I wish I could find it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463014/#Comment_463014" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-05T21:55:17+00:00" title="May  5, 2017  9:55PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2017 9:56PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya on all of that.  I don't even know if we really disagree!  Maybe we do, or maybe we're just coming from very different experiences, making different assumptions, emphasizing different components...<br/><br/>I experienced (and perpetrated) a lot of GM tyranny in middle school (age 11-13), but then in high school (age 14-18) my play was more often sabotaged by attempts at impartiality.  Or, well, I guess it's more accurate to say it was sabotaged by bad scenario design; but it was the GM's insistence on "what would happen" that prevented any salvaging of those messes (and it was clear that our scenario design abilities weren't going to blossom overnight).<br/><br/>I've also had a lot of fun in games where I opted in to GM deception.  Want to fudge some die rolls to make your pet NPC come off as appropriately menacing?  Fine by me!  Just don't use deception to take meaningful choices away from me, and we're all good.  I'm not saying this is my preferred way to play, I'm just saying that, in the White Wolf games I'm thinking of, the GM wasn't doing enough actual harm for it to be worth my while to eye them suspiciously.  All I'd accomplish would be to cost myself the chance to make the best of things.  <br/><br/>As a player, the more I prioritize "fun" over "fair", the happier I am.<br/><br/>The only response I've ever had to <i>truly</i> harmful GMing was to quit and GM my own game.

It was there as a guideline. Rulings were made in the spot if we couldn't find the rule in the book, we could turn the dice into an impartial referee when we couldn't reach an agreement and both GM and players always stuck to it. Perhaps it was this that saved us from having totally a dysfunctional experience or never ever being able to trust the GM fiat again. Also, we had more than one GM choice and as we started to find out things that we didn't like from this GM or that and agreed exactly on which, we developed our own toned down version of this gameplay.<br/><br/>I don't think we ever reached the "cult of the GM" level of things on our games, but when the experience is consistently good through the years you don't talk or worry about transparency. You just remember how great were the times you spent playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463135/#Comment_463135" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T08:22:17+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  8:22AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1/2\n<p>Ok, you want a point by point breakdown of this old post so bad you're harassing me all through the night over PM?</p><p>As I tried to explain to you in PM:</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097, in PM" rel="nofollow">2097, in PM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I was very clear about<br/></p><ul><li><br/>Specifically addressing it to Airk, by name<br/></li><li><br/>Giving a <em>new</em> and revelant reason for why the mirror experience mattered to <em>me</em></li><li><br/>Being <em>very</em> clear about why what I was saying was specific to the resolution system for that <em>particular</em> game<br/></li><li><br/>Explicitly leaving provisions for two other types of play styles, and how they differed but could still be functional<br/></li></ul>\nWho could ask for anything more?!<br/></div></blockquote>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Thanks Sandra and Airk, though a bit more into this and I realized a couple of things I'm ready to reconsider and concede a bit.</p></div></blockquote><p>You are missing context.
