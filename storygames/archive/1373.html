                    Okay, so in a variety of threads we're talking about "how RPGs work" and comparing them to "how sports work" and "how LARPs work" and "how quilting circles work."  Repeatedly, we're referring to "how RPGs work" by referencing a traditional/mainstream play structure that is, I highly suspect, composed of 80% assumption and 20% reduction.  It's something like this:
<blockquote><cite>Traditional Play</cite><br/>There's a GM who's also often the host.  The group gets together on a regular (weekly, biweekly) basis to play an ongoing game that has no planned endpoint.  Each week is a new installment, forwarding the story onward.  Individual characters may die; they are usually replaced.  Play continues week to week until the players get bored and/or real life interrupts the weekly meetings.  The underlying assumption seems to be that the game usually ends before the story reaches climax.</blockquote>
I don't think that the above is very realistic, either in terms of how the folks on this forum play or in terms of how folks beyond this forum play.  I think it makes a lot of oversimplified and disparaging assumptions about how gamers interact socially.  I think it mistakes how gamers present their games with how gamers actually play their games.  In short, I think it's bullshit.<br/><br/>What I'd like to hear in this thread is how you currently play.  If you'd like to add in how you used to play <em>as well</em>, that's gravy, but I'd caution: (a) I want to hear about your current play structure first, and (b) please be careful to describe how you actually played, not how you might have described it to another potential player at the time.<br/><br/>This is how I play:<br/><br/><strong>LA Games Playtesting Circle</strong><br/>We meet weekly, either on Tuesday or Wednesday depending on individual schedules.  There are currently five active members, and on any given week there's three to five of us there.  If you can't make it, you can't make it, and it's not a very big deal.  We play lots of different games, and with the exception of our very first game, we haven't played any single game in two consecutive sessions.  There is no planned 'endpoint' to the circle, but we've had to members drop out to pursue other commitments, and while we miss them, it hasn't messed up anything.<br/><br/><strong>The Summer Campaign</strong><br/>Ever since I headed off to college, and then after I came home and my brothers have taken their turns going to college, we have been doing "the summer campaign."  Each summer we play a new game: a short-run, three-to-six session thing.  They've been pretty traditional fare, with a GM and a preplanned story arc to fit the available time.  We meet sort-of weekly; there are a lot more than six weeks in a summer vacation, and we don't plan to play every single week.  We play when we can, and since our planned story-arc doesn't blithely assume that we'll play every week, it's not a problem when we don't.  Over time we've gone from incorporating other friends home from college to playing with the wives.  We usually make it a dinner-and-game night thing.<br/><br/><strong>Belletrists Online Tabletop</strong><br/>I'm actually not doing this anymore, but was up until recently.  In all truth, I've discovered that I live in a giant city with lots of gamers and setting up a face-to-face game is actually easier than setting up an online game.  But.  When we were playing, we met up once a month on a MUSH server (sort of like souped-up chat).  When one player couldn't make it, we just scene-framed her out of the action.  When two players couldn't make it, we rescheduled.  We played Dogs; the assumed commitment was to complete one town and see if we wanted to continue.  We didn't finish the town; nobody was very hung up about this.<br/><br/><strong>Pick-Up Gaming</strong><br/>This last sunday my wife was bored so we invited Jesse over to play/playtest my reversed-engineering game.  He showed up, we played a pretty long session (8 hours), and ate curry.  Pretty simple.  My wife and I pick up and play games occasionally, as well.<br/><br/>I'm going to skip over Con games, even though I'm starting to consider them a large part of my RPG "diet."  How do other folks play?                </div>

<b>How I currently play</b><br/>
I show up at StoryGames Boston on a Wednesday and hope there's something going on.<br/>
<br/>
I have plans to add a second outlet for play, but they haven't fruited yet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How I used to play when I lived in Philly, 2 months ago.</b><br/>
We'd play every week on a Wednesday.  A given game would last 6-9 weeks at a stretch and then there'd be a gap of a couple of months before we got the next one together.  Everyone would gather at our house at 7 and order Chinese, kibbitz and hang out.  Around 8 or 8:30 I'd move people to recapping the previous session and talking about what they liked in it and what they thought was coming up in the current session.  Then I'd take a smoke break and plan for 10 minutes, then we'd play.  Play would last about 3 - 3 1/2 hours, wrapping up just before midnight.  If someone couldn't make a session then we'd try and reschedule for that week.  I'd try and pace things so everyone's Kickers wrapped up in the last or second-to-last session.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How I used to play when I lived in Ithaca, 2 years ago.</b><br/>
We'd play every week on a Thursday.  I was GM'ing a long-running 7th Sea game.  My friend Dan was always the host.  We'd meet at the ABC cafe, down the block, and eat dinner and hang out together.  Then we'd go up to Dan's place and game from around 8pm to 1 or 2 am.  We'd kill a couple bottles of wine and a bunch of chips and cookies while we gamed.  Around 12:30, Bobwoolfe would lay down on the floor and pass out, but we'd nudge him awake if we needed his input.<br/>
<br/>
The game was a "long-running" campaign, but I always knew that there would come an ending.  By the time I started this campaign I'd already run, and successfully ended, three other campaigns, each with a duration of 2 1/2 - 3 years, so I knew it could be done.  Within a couple of weeks of starting, I knew roughly what the final revelations would be.  I just didn't know how the players' path from where they were would lead them to those revelations.  About 6 months before I had  to leave Ithaca I announced to the players that we were entering the Endgame and that<br/>
a) I would not be introducing any new subplots, only revealling existing aspects of stuff as they discovered it, and<br/>
b) I would not be framing up adventures for them.  Instead, they should establish their next goals and targets before each session and I would have prepped the material to cover said goals and targets.<br/>
It worked out pretty well, IIRC.                        </div>

                            Okay then, I pick up your gauntlet.<br><br><b>Mike Holmes' Shadow World <i>HeroQuest</i> Game</b><br>This is a weekly IRC game.  Play generally runs three to four hours.  Two players hold 'GM-power', one of them must be present for play to happen (it's almost always Mike).  We have a huge cast, but generally 3 to 6 players will show any given week.  Some are regular, showing almost every week, some are sparodic.  No biggie either way.  If a player doesn't show for long enough then their character will often be NPC'd, but will be returned to the player if they return.  Since most of the characters are involved in semi-independent plot-lines, missing a few sessions is no big deal.<br><br><b>Foundry <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> Game</b><br>Temporarily on hold for some reorganization, but this was also a weekly game.  One GM, three players.  Three hour sessions.  If one of the players didn't show up, play didn't happen.  Period.  We're planning/hoping to complete three towns before reevaluating to see if we want to continue.<br><br><b>Otherworld <i>HeroQuest</i> Game</b><br>Looks pretty much like the <i>Dogs</i> game.  Everyone shows, or play doesn't happen.  The major difference is that we don't really have a planned ending point.<br><br>So, it appears that two out of three of my games look pretty 'traditional'.<br><br>Thomas                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua,<br><br/>Actually, your example above is pretty close to how my group plays, with the solid exception that it's understood the campaign for whatever game being played has a pre-determined end. No one, not even the GM, knows how long that might take, but every week after week we play until the story-arc/campaign has run it's course and come to the end and completed the goal as established in the very beginning. Then we switch games and start over.<br/><br/>Occasionally we put the regular campaign on hold and try something else for a couple of weeks just for variety or to test a new game, but after that we get back to the campaign.                        </br></div>

<b>Pickup Games</b><br/><br/>These days, I play one-shots. For example, Fred Hicks invited me to play AGON with him and his friends a few weeks ago. On Thursday or Friday night, I got an emailed invitation that described the game and how he wanted us to bring the awesomeness and the trash-talk. Saturday morning, I drove down to his house, got a bit lost, but eventually found my way. We talked and made up characters then played through the scenario. There's been no talk, as far as I know, of an ongoing AGON series or anything like that.<br/><br/><b>Miniconventions</b><br/><br/>I run an annual house con called AdamCon. I invite just about everyone I know and folks converge on my house over the weekend of/before July 4th weekend, which is usually a holiday. I run most of the games but sometimes we play a GMless game (I still had to teach people the rules for Roach) or board games or card games and sometimes another person will GM a game of some kind. This lasts all weekend. I generally get to run or play in 3-4 RPGs, play some other card and board games, and hang out with friends I don't get to see all the time. It's a blast. And my non-gamer wife is a saint.<br/><br/><b>Old School</b><br/><br/>I used to run a D&amp;D campaign. The most recent one started a month or so after 3E came out. We met every other week. Characters died occasionally and players made up new replacements and we worked them in somehow. More people joined and occasionally there'd be 9-10 players around the table. So many players meant less attention per player and some got bored and left, and some moved away. We generally had 6-7 core players. But there were really two groups within that one group: one liked the Gamist kill-and-loot play and the others wanted political and social role-play. I split the group into two separate campaigns so they could have more of the stuff they wanted.  I continued to host the "adventure" group at my house for a while but a really bad argument with one of my friends (unrelated to the game and not even during one of them) resulted in us not speaking for a year or so (resolved now) but I closed that campaign down and never picked it up again. The "political" group gathered at the apartment of two of the players about once a month. We played for a while before things puttered out. I had artificially extended the other campaign (didn't let them beat the bad guy, essentially) because I didn't know how to sustain play and figured they didn't want it to end. I should have let them win big and said 'The End.' We transitioned abruptly over to my new Towerlands setting that I was designing on my wiki. We played a half dozen times in that before one of the players moved to another state and the group dynamics didn't seem the same anymore, so I stopped running it.                        </div>

                            How I currently play<br/><b>daily</b><br/>My spouse and I might do impromptu scenes.<br/><br/><b>weekly</b><br/>PBeM games (three of them) that have a GM post either once a month, or three times a week. These games either work through private email or a list server. The games have 3 to 15 people in them.<br/><br/><b>monthly</b><br/>Amber DRPG. This game meets twice a month for eight hours on a Saturday. A GM and two players. If a player isn't there, the game can run with just a single player quite well. This game has been running off and on since 1996. It started as a once a week game with three players. The GM is often the host, but the game travels when there is a reason to do so. Players who have since moved from the area make 'cameo appearances' in the game when they visit town.<br/><br/><b>yearly</b><br/>Homebrew rpg. This game meets once every four months for six to 12 hours across two days. Hosting duties switch off. Three players and a GM. The game is an experiment with comedy romance genre.<br/><br/>Amber DRPG convention. For me, this event happens once a year. There are eight game periods of four to six hours across four days. Each game may have two GMs and two to sixteen players. I've done this irregularly for eight years and find that I'm running games for smaller groups (six max.) I usually run three games, play four and socialize for one period.                        </div>

                            Oh, this is worth sharing, and I'd meant to include it but forgot.  You'll note that the three games I'm involved with are all online (or maybe you didn't, but they are...)<br/><br/>There's a reason for this, and it plays into footprint stuff.  I've got a close group of friends and we share a lot of the same interests.  Board gaming, design, similar tastes in fiction and in study, all that jazz.  But we're all busy, busy, busy people.<br/><br/>I'm a fulltime student, and I'm working 24~30 hours/week to pay for that.  Same thing with Nikki.  And Will works full time, does school part time, and is involved in mentoring high-school students.  Oh, and Jared just got married and is teaching 7th graders.<br/><br/>All this means that social gathering are catch-as-catch can.  Getting everyone together in once place happens about once every six weeks or so.  Sometimes Nikki and I will be the only ones free.  Sometimes me and Will.  Sometimes Jared, me and Nikki.  You get the idea.<br/><br/>The result of all this instability is that we don't meet regularly, we just meet when we can.  With chances for interaction so few and far between, we want every single instance to be as fun-packed as possible.  And it turns out that, for us, a one-shot of <i>PTA</i> just isn't as satisfying as a night of board gaming.  This is probably due to the fact that some of us just don't feel like we're <i>done</i> at the end of that one-shot.  We want to play the rest of the show.  Not in the sense of 'that'd be fun, but if we don't that's okay' (which is the case with our board game play), but in the sense that 'man, part of the fun for this activity was invested in future play, but we probably will never get that effort rewarded.  Suck.'<br/><br/>So, yeah, a lot of the social footprint stuff that's been discussed recently matters to me.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<b>Recently deceased</b><br/><br/>Two PBP games, one of PTA, one of Capes.  The PTA one probably had a hypothetical foot-print of about forty hours over the course of a year.  We didn't get there.  The Capes had an unlimited foot-print.  Both of them just faded away, when people realized that they didn't feel like posting any more.  As is typical of PBP, the "break-up" was conducted by everyone studiously ignoring the fact that there was a game.  First person to mention someone would have borne the onus of being the one to break up the game.<br/><br/><b>Recent past</b><br/><br/>Just finished a six (seven?) session TSOY game:  24 hours over way more than twelve weeks.  We tried to do a meeting every other week, but schedules were insane.  I spent <i>at least</i> six hours total trying to keep track of the schedules, and jigger things into a position that would let us game.  Also, I skipped out on some things that, honestly, I'd rather have gone to if it hadn't meant disappointing my friends.<br/><br/>Before that we played a six session PTA game which followed exactly the same pattern.  <i>Exactly</i>.<br/><br/>I was very much <b>not</b> dissatisfied with these games as games.  They were spectacular roleplaying, and I'd do them again in a heartbeat!  But they certainly were a pain-in-the-ass when considered as elements of my life and schedule.<br/><br/><b>Right now</b><br/><br/>Last week I had a board gaming night, and that was a freakin' ball.  Lots of people showed up.  Most of my regular gaming crowd couldn't, but we had friends from work, friends from the internet, all that good jazz.  We did Jungle Speed and Memoir '44 and Puerto Rico.  I left it very energized, and ran out to start writing up the threads that eventually emerged as Social Footprint.<br/><br/>Wednesday I had playtesting for Misery Bubblegum, which had been rapidly and effectively rejiggered into a small footprint game.  Two of the three friends coming had to cancel in the two days coming up to the game.  Not a problem.  Eric showed up, we played two games of Memoir '44, we played one game of Misery Bubblegum, we considered whether to play something else but decided that, at 11 p.m., the hour was late enough that he ought to be heading home.                        </div>

                            To compliment what Thomas has said...since he's covered a lot of my play, in FTF, I've been playing sporadically of late, because of scheduling issues. The last game I played regularly - weekly - was an indefinite length game where I was the sole GM. <br/><br/>Here's the thing. I like the traditional model. I agree that it's problematic because of the footprint, and even that it might be getting more and more problematic, especially as my social groups age. But I don't care. It's not been problematic enough that I haven't found ways around it. In fact, I'm pretty sure that, had I more time myself to play more weekly games, I could organize at least one, and probably two more weekly FTF games with the same old traditional footprint. <br/><br/>Instead I settle for randomly scheduled WH40K and boardgames, because that simply takes less time. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Mike, do your indefinite-length games come to a satisfying end, or collapse?  Assuming it's not the latter, what do you that makes that happen?                        </div>

<b>Friday Night Group:</b> We get together around 6:30pm each Friday, order pizza (or something else that delivers; we'll run for food if people are tired of pizza) and begin playing.  At the moment we're playing an ongoing D&amp;D game.  We tend to play in 8-16 week chunks, picking up other games at the end of logical story arcs, when the GM runs out of inspiration, etc.  We usually play 2 systems at a time; right now we're switching between the D&amp;D game and a d6 Star Wars game.  Our games tend to last 18-24 months before we abandon a game.<br/><br/>There are five of us who play and we're quite consistent. We always cancel if more than one person will miss, and occassionally if any one person will miss.  We play at my place, where I provide soda but not food. Different people GM the two active games; we've all GMed at one point or another.  We play until people start drifting off-- often around 11 or 11:30, but sometimes we're jazzed and play til 1 or 2 am.<br/><br/><b>Wednesday Night Group:</b> There's some overlap w/ Friday night, but several additional people are on the Wednesday night list.  We get together at 6:30 and play until 10-11pm.  It's all board gaming, mostly Euro games with a few party games mixed in when  more people show.  Some people show consistently, while others are very occassional players.  I call around Tuesday night to see who will make it the next day-- I cancel if too many won't show.<br/><br/><b>Thursday Night:</b> I'm currently recruiting for a PTA game, scheduled opposite my girlfriend's magic classes.  I was hoping the defined beginning and end would make recruiting easier, but it seems too alien to the local mindset.  Hopefully it'll take off soon.<br/><br/><b>Occassional One Shot and Weekend Games:</b> When friends visit from out of town, we'll often play a one shot RPG game or play lots of board games.  Over the 4th of July, we went up to a friend's trailer and played board and roleplaying games for the weekend.                        </div>

<strong>Current games:</strong><br/><br/>   I play in one old skool D&amp;D-modified campaign that in theory meets every Friday, though we usually just skip a week if one of us can't make it.  All of the players are friends from back in college (which is now 15+ years in the past), and we usually do a homecooked dinner (fortunately our usual host is an excellent cook) and then share fine single-malts and the like while we game.  I think we all see the social gathering as the point of the evening, but we enjoy the mainly hack-n-slash gaming part of things too.  At least most of the time.  We tend to have long campaigns which get wrapped up because the characters have reached a level where the system starts to creak, rather than because the GM has had an endpoint of the story arc in mind all along.<br/><br/>   I also play in a D&amp;D 3.5 game with an entirely different group of friends that usually meets once a month, which requires a friend and I to drive 1.5-2 hours each way to get there.  There is a big story arc with an overall goal that the characters are trying to achieve, but I'm not entirely sure that the game will last long enough for us to get there, as it's already been going on for three years.<br/><br/>   The only other gaming I'm currently getting in is at <a href="http://www.ambercons.com/" rel="nofollow">Ambercons</a>, and, now that I think I'm only going to be going to one of those a year, that's not a lot of non-D&amp;D gaming.  I'd quite like to get more opportunities to play "indie" games, but I don't know how soon that might come about.<br/><br/><strong>Past games:</strong><br/><br/>   I was in one long-term Amber Diceless RPG campaign that ran for several years, and seemed to be entirely open-ended, though the GM did manage to have a sort of climax to the whole thing once she decided to end it.<br/><br/>   Otherwise there was a lot of PBEM gaming, something I don't do anymore, in which I don't think I once played in a game that came to a conclusion story-wise.  Not once.                        </div>

                            Roleplaying<br/>
<br/>
We play every wednesday, starting at around 6-7 p.m. I originally planned to swap hosting duties with one other player who lives nearby, but he recently moved in with his fiancÃ© and was busy organising a local con, so the last couple of games were played at my place. <br/>
<br/>
We meet for about 4-5 hours each week, where we try to finish one complete adventure. We first started playing an on-going Warhammer Fantasy "campaign", in the sense of stringing together a bunch of short, easy-to-run written adventures. The only continuity between them are the characters. No GM-planned metaplots or recurring NPCs so far. We only had to split an adventure over two nights once. If one of the players can't make it, we switch to some other game for the night. We try to follow up a WFRP game with a one-shot of some other game. Games we've played: With Great Power..., Dogs in the Vineyard, Primetime Adventures, InSpectres, Galactic. And the occasional board- or cardgame if somebody had to cancel at the last minute. The last couple of games though, have all been Indie though. Mostly DITV. <br/>
<br/>
It's a very solid core group of 4 people (plus me), although weddings, honeymoons and the like threaten my players' commitment in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Boardgames &amp; Cardgames<br/>
<br/>
I also run a weekly boardgame night, which I've just moved from friday evening to saturday evening. I've had this one for a little over a year, and we're slowly settling into a groove as far as the gaming/hanging out-ratio is concerned. We play games like RoboRally, Shadows over Camelot, Bug Bluff and Cash'n'Guns. Fairly easy to pick up and reasonably quick to play. We play at a nearby African restaurant and start at eight, so we usually only have time for one big game or two smaller ones. <br/>
<br/>
To be honest though, I'm really eager to bring out Doom, Fury of Dracula and Junta again. I'd even settle for Illuminati or Hacker, but the boardgame people aren't that enthusiastic yet. The fact that those games are all in English is making them a tough sell, too.                        </div>

<b>Group 13</b><br/>Six of us meet weekly on Monday or Tuesday nights, from 7 to 11:30 or midnight, organizing through a phpbb forum we maintain for our game just for that purpose. We meet at the offices of Channel 13/BBC America (i.e., the offices of the public television corp. here in NYC), where one of my players works. We use one of the conference rooms. Generally, the first order of business is to order food for delivery. It is not uncommon for one of us to bring a couple six packs of beer. We play in a consciously "traditional" manner. I'm the GM and the rest are players. We have a Burning Wheel campaign with no designated endpoint, though over the course of the past two years or so, we have wrapped up three campaigns and are presently playing a fourth. If one of us can't make it, we default to a back-up campaign. Another member of the group GMs that, and I play. Otherwise the procedure is the same. If the player that supplied the space can't make it, we default to a conference room at Nettwerk Music Group, where one of the players works.<br/><br/><b>Group Nettwerk</b><br/>Five of us meet weekly on Thursday nights. There is no overlap (other than me) between Group 13 and Group Nettwerk, though all members of both groups are friends. We generally get together at 6 p.m. after work and go out to dinner together. Then we go back to the offices of Nettwerk Music Group, where one of the players works. We play in one of the conference rooms. We never drink in this group as two of the players are straight edge. We play until 11 p.m. This group is set up as a playtesting and new games group. We generally play games for one to three sessions and then switch up. We take turns bringing games to the group. Generally the person that brings the game also runs it, assuming the game has a GM. The most recent games have been Donjon and Shock:. If a person can't be there one week, we play anyway (unless it's the player that supplies the space).<br/><br/><b>Group BWHQ</b><br/>This is the core BWHQ group, and largely overlaps the Group Nettwerk crew, though not exactly. Seven of us get together about twice a month at Luke's apartment on a Saturday or Sunday. Sometimes we go out to eat together first, sometimes we bring food, sometimes we come already fed. Sometimes we go out to eat afterward. We get together between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and play until 6 or 7. This group is largely straight edge. We have lots of water and healthy snacks on hand. We play Burning Wheel with one GM and a defined end point, though the end point is dictated by in-game events, not a schedule we keep to or a mechanic in the game. If one player can't make it, we don't meet, though we may get together to play something else, like Memoir '44.<br/><br/><b>Group Iskander</b><br/>This is a group of four that meets two Saturdays a month. We get together at Alexander's apartment and play from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. This is a new group, but it has a single GM (Alexander). We play Nine Worlds. It is so far fairly casual. I expect that if any player can't make it, we will not meet.                        </div>

                            Joshua, your original blockquote describes my groups to a "T". They play D&amp;D and HERO.<br/><br/>The one exception is that my Monday D&amp;D group has been playing the same campaign for 3-4 years, and we have an overaching goal we're trying to accomplish that will probably culminate at 20th level. After that, it's up in the air whether we'll try some Epic play ro move on to a new campiagn.<br/><br/>I supopse one other exception is Chicago Gameday, but that's typical one-shot stuff. People sign up, you play 4 hours or so, and it's done.                        </div>

                            My fucking net just ate my fucking 2 page long reply. <br/><br/>Fuck you interwebs. <br/><br/>The short form goes like this: <br/><br/>One on One Games -- Probably my most played at this point. I play with Mo a lot, and the two of us you know, live together, and so that makes playing at the drop of a hat easy. We have regular games and not regular games, and tend to cycle in and out of different ones in shifts. I also play a few of these on a catch-as-catch-can basis with others. They're easier to do, once you get used to the shifts in style needed to make them work. <br/><br/>Online Games -- Dogs online, baby. Do it all the time. Been thinking about dropping in on Mike and doing Heroquest again too. <br/><br/>Boardgames -- Two differently monthly boardgame meetings. One with the friends, where anyone who can drops in and we play hot boardgames. Another with Mo's sisters, who love them Days of Wonder games and because of them have been asking about RPing recently. The friends group has been trying to get together another monthly night for pick up RPGs (I've high hopes about Spirit of the Century for this), and we'll see if that happens when I get home. <br/><br/>Long Running Trady Games -- I've been in one of these, ususally Exalted, for the last several years. Usually monthly to twice monthly, on Sundays. The next one is due to start in November. <br/><br/>Once In a Blue Moon Games -- A tradition I started when playing Tribe 8 with Wicked Ink. These are epic session games that happen quarterly or less often, and must go big when they go. I've done this ongoing with Mage and 7th Sea, and it works out well so long as we can tie up each session before the end. Because dangling bits for 5+ months sucks. <br/><br/>All of this, of course, is not applicable while I'm 9000 miles from home.                        </div>

<b>How I really want to play:</b><br/>
What I really want is a group of 4 or 5 people, all told, who're willing to try and meet weekly.  Play would rotate between different short-arc games, with each arc lasing 3-6 sessions.  "Gap" weeks could be filled by boardgames or one-shots.  Longer campaigns could be formatted into 3-6 session blocks, the way that ongoing comic books are formatted into graphic novels.<br/>
<br/>
That's pretty much my dream gaming setup.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br><br>Mo and I have two games we play regularly -- every Friday night and every other Saturday (barring other social engagements). Those tend to be played in the later hours, and to run for 4ish hours a session. (Playing from midnight till 4 in the morning, after getting back from a dinner engagement, is common. It destroys the weekend, but its worth it.) <br><br/>We also have um, 2?, other games we play semi-regularly, like when the TV sucks. <br/><br/>Past that we've a few more that we play in waves -- like every holiday season we play a rocking 7th Sea game for a week or so (like every night) and then put it away until the next year. <br/><br/>Playing with the wife is easy.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            One that I haven't seen so far here (if I missed it in the list, sorry):<br/>
<br/>
<b>Semi-competitive GMing</b><br/>
<br/>
Back in high school, the group I played with met two nights a week, for about six hours each night.  Usually, two sessions would happen each night, for a total of four a week.  More than half the people in the group GMed, and several different systems were played.<br/>
<br/>
At the start of the weekend, there would generally be multiple people willing to GM, sometimes each with multiple ideas for games to run that night.  They'd toss out vague descriptions of their ideas, along the lines of "I've got an idea for D&amp;D, characters about eighth level.  It's a city adventure."  The group would (eventually) come to a consensus about what to play, and the selected GM would start their adventure.  It would continue for about three hours, and would either wrap up by then, or we'd stop at a natural stopping point for it to be continued later.<br/>
<br/>
The "semi-competitive" aspect came in with the fact that GMs wanted to get to run their ideas... and so would try to put on the best "show" they could while they were running games, so the group would want to play in their adventures again.<br/>
<br/>
This lead to a lot of heavy illusionist GMing in some cases, where the GM would march the group through an adventure while making it seem as if everything was their idea.  On the flip side, some of the GMs became extremely good at improvisation, essentially tailoring an adventure as they went along to the players who were there that night and their characters.                        </div>

<p>I got one.</p>
<p><strong>Sol Invictus</strong><br>
It's a long-running trad game over IRC, under the Exalted system. Nominally we are playtesting Charms for a fansupplement, but the fansupp is long complete and now we are just having fun.</br></p>
<p>We have regular weekly sessions, when the GM and at least half the players show. On hiatus right now, because the GM is getting married, moving, doing wedding prep, &amp;c. Congrats, Josh!</p>
<p>We also do "miniscenes" with like one to three players (one of whom may be but isn't always the GM), on weeks when we have absentee players, or at various times during the week when we're around and feel like playing. These aren't always in line with the timeline of weekly sessions; sometimes we will say "hey let's do a mini about things that happened like three sessions ago" or "we will do this bit in minis since you all are splitting up" or "let's do a foreshadowing mini and like see what it does to the next few sessions."</p>
<p>We also have a nice collection of "in-character documents", ephemera from inside the game, that we keep on a wiki. The GM makes most of these but we also make our own from time to time.</p>
<p>It's a pretty interesting model; the long-running game and the consistency of the characters gives a lot of weight and depth to the solo-play of ICdocs and pickup play of miniscenes.</p>

It seems to me to assume an absolute allegiance to a number of Geek Social Fallacies and require the participants to be completely without critical faculties.  Especially if you include the last "underlying assumption" it's a model that consistently and reliably <em>fails</em> and I have trouble believing that large numbers of people repeat behavior which they know will not work.                        </div>

                            I consider myself fairly fortunate. While I was living in Brazil, we had a traditional group. Met every week. We ran 2 long campaigns (more than 1 year combined) meeting almost every week which had a very satisfying end. This was GURPS on a fantasy setting. Ran a weekly GURPS Camelot campaign over several months through the end. Played a GURPS Vampire campaign also over a few months and again through the end. These games had 4-11 players and were successful getting a regular quorum. We played a few short games in-between campaigns. Even after I moved, I ran a DL SAGA in the USA while my friend ran in Brazil and 2-3 times the groups got together and in one of these crossovers, we coordinated a finale. <br>
<br>
For the couple of years that I moved back to Brazil, we ran a short Castle Falkenstein game (2-3 sessions). A failed D20 DL campaign (the DM missed a lot), so no finale. A weekly 5-6 months successful D20 DL campaign through the end. A D20 Modern (Alias style) campaign (9 sessions) through the end. And finished with a 3-session Castle Falkenstein adventure. Now, I am back in the USA. The only currently open-ended RPG we have is Castle Falkenstein where whenever we get together, we run some adventure that lasts for a few sessions.                        </br></br></div>

<b>Many years ago</b><br>I used to run a game of RQ, but I was very rarely the host. I never pushed for a regular session; I would always wait for somebody else to organise it. We would often play on a Friday or Saturday afternoon and then go out nightclubbing. At times we would organise to start a game at 9am so we could play all day (12 or 14 hours).<br><br>All the people I played with were friends outside the game, and several had known each other since primary school. Over the years I even shared houses with some of these guys.<br><br>We all smoked large amounts of pot while playing, but alcohol was normally a secondary thing (I don't drink much, for example). <br/><br/>Quite a few characters died over time, but a few characters continued the thread. I'll admit to fudging to keep certain characters alive, because their death would in fact have killed the game.<br/><br/>This game got put into limbo in 1999, when I moved interstate (at which point it had been going for 16 years). I still run a few sessions of it whenever I get back to my old hometown.<br/><br/><b>Right now</b><br/>I'm playing in one group right now which sounds like what Robert wants: six people with an explicit agreement to play short-run games (with an option to return). We play fortnightly. I'm enjoying it a lot, but I do miss playing with people with whom I share more than playing RPGs.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua - Ok, I guess part of it for me is that my games don't have an over-arching story or anything to climax, so the game isn't building towards something that is never attained. We play, and it's fun, and eventually it becomes less fun (because we reach some point in the game system where the nature of the game changes, people drop out/schedules change, or we [I] are just ready for something different). Perhaps it's useful to compare such RPG play to bridge groups (or any other similarly organized activity). Is it sad that a group of people will regularly play bridge together, with the group membership possibly changing, and eventually something happens to break up the group? If not (and I see absolutely no reason that's sad), why is it any worse for an RPG game to have a similar life (and for those, like me, who like the continuity effect, there's a bonus over the bridge model).<br/><br/>Maybe it helps that long ago I realized I was never going to have one of those 10 year long campaigns (let alone 20 or 30 that these days <b>could</b> exist). Or maybe it was even that I realized I would never hit a 5 year campaign. By the end of college, I was quite satisfied that a year and a half was about the most I could expect a campaign to last for me. In fact 6-9 months is way more likely. And that's just fine for me. But I don't feel any need to plan the ending of a campaign, in fact, for anything more than a handfull of sessions, I think it would be very hard to plan for an ending and actually reach that, far more likely, you will plan out the ending for a 1 year long campaign, and the campaign will die just before this ending that you've invested in.<br/><br/>And no doubt, it's a bummer when a campaign ends. I was also bummed out to move away from college. Before that, I'm sure I was bummed out to move away from the town I lived in for 10 years, and later to move away from high school, and even away from junior high. I was bummed to leave Raleigh NC for Portland OR, even though there was lots of exciting possibilities. I've been bummed out to leave committees at church, and to see groups that I worked hard to foster wither away. It's a bummer to lose friends to cancer and old age (I forget when one of the players in my high school D&amp;D group died, it was either during my first year of college, or during the summer before when the group had mostly dispersed, I know I was aware he was struggling with cancer near the end of the game, and I learned about his passing when calling him up to game [which is why I think it might have been durring the first year of college]). It's even a bummer when I reach the end of a novel, or a series (and there I did get a planned climax).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

This reminds me, again, of the "how'd I get a story in my D&amp;D" discussions that have happened on various places on the net over the years. Because I remember way, way back in the day play like this. You'd show up and play and each game was, you know, a game. We weren't playing towards anything (maybe 20th level, but even the idea of getting to the Gold box came along later), we were just playing. <br/><br/>It's when we got into the concept of the epic story and added the curry of ongoing plot to the chocolate of our D&amp;D that the trouble started.                        </div>

                            I have three regular groups at the moment:<br/><br/><b>Amber</b><br/><br/>This is group is centered on me, my wife Liz, and our friend Bill -- with other members shifting a bit.  We play biweekly on Friday or Saturday evenings.  We played in Vinland RuneQuest campaign that I GMed for two years, and the Buffy RPG for three years -- both of which came to satisfactory conclusions.  The Buffy campaign was three self-contained season arcs of 15 session each.  We've also played various short games including My Life With Master, Polaris, Blue Rose, Truth &amp; Justice, and Parlor Larps.  Right now we're playing Amber as GMed by Madeline.  The current members are Madeline, Lee, Bill, Cynthia, Liz, and myself.  It's a bit notable that Bill and I are the only men.  <br/><br/><b>Harnies</b><br/><br/>This group is centered on Jim, David, and Dennis who have been playing for ages -- but I've joined a four years ago, and Daniel joined a few months ago.  Also, Elliot used to play with us but has stopped at the moment.  We usually meet on Sunday afternoons at Jim's house.  We got together over HarnMaster play, but we do other games regularly.  We've also done James Bond 007, Lord of the Rings, and (briefly) Dogs in the Vineyard.  Right now we're playing Call of Cthulhu, game-mastered by myself.  The campaigns don't generally have an arc which closes.  Most often, the GM says that he's tired of running, we wrap up the current adventure and then try something else.  <br/><br/>There's some overlap with the other group.  Jim used to play in the Vinland RuneQuest campaign, and has done a few one-shots since then.  Also, Liz and her sister Laura tried playing in the Lord of the Rings game, but eventually dropped out.  <br/><br/><b>GURPSers</b><br/><br/>This is a group new to me in the last few months, who play on Tuesday evenings -- ostensibly weekly but with a lot of misses.  It consists of Jesse, Peter, Cliff, and myself.  We were mostly brought in by Ryan, who unfortunately moved away from the area a few weeks ago.  Ryan contacted me through my listing on the Steve Jackson Games player-finder.  We played a Hero System Gamma World adventure which came to a satisfactory conclusion, and two towns of Dogs in the Vineyard.  Right now Cliff is GMing his first game, and he's doing GURPS Supers where we're all supervillains.  <br/><br/>There is no overlap with the other groups.                        </div>

                            This is another model that I may be moving towards more:<br/><br/><b>GenCon <i>Avatar</i> Playtest</b><br/><br/>Shreyas, Thomas, and I were playing.  Selene was watching and occasionally commentating from the wings.  The three players had spent the past week roadtripping together, sleeping in tents and singing along to Sean Paul together.  We were fucking ON: reading each other really well and knowing exactly what we wanted out of play. We didn't need resolution mechanics.  We just needed goals to drive towards and then a mechanic that would pace the game properly, so the results would come out "feeling right" (which we had, thanks to an early incarnation of "key chains" or the "journey map" that Daniel described).  And then we freeformed the rest.  Usually I would throw down some GM fiat and then the other players would throw out ideas on top of that, negotiating the result a bit.  This "negotiated GM fiat" was super fast and worked really well, mostly because of the strong sense of shared purpose.<br/><br/>I think you can see the same thing happening in the Durham 3, the Vincent's old "Adventures in Improvized System" threads, and other groups where people really get each other and know what they're doing.                        </div>

                            Brand - yea, I think you've nailed it. See, I never bought into the epic story idea. I saw people doing it, and I saw the problems right away. That doesn't mean there can't be any story at all to the "adventures," it just means that there can't be an overarching epic story that "must" be completed. Each adventure is then filled with its own climaxes, and it's a lot easier to try and keep going until the climax, but even if you don't, it isn't this huge let down, because it's at most a few weeks of play invested (well, maybe more than a few, but honestly, if a single "adventure" takes more than a few weeks, I start to get old on it).<br/><br/>And from a pure level gaining standpoint, I've always figured you never played til the end (and thus I really don't see a need for epic level D&amp;D).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>Perhaps it's useful to compare such RPG play to bridge groups (or any other similarly organized activity). Is it sad that a group of people will regularly play bridge together, with the group membership possibly changing, and eventually something happens to break up the group?</blockquote>
I think Brand's already identified the difference, here.  The "Traditional Play" in the OP is not like a bridge club because it has that epic-level continuing storyline that cannot be abandoned or else the entire affair is a failure.  Modular play, with each session its own adventure with its own ups and downs and climax, and the individual stories loosely connected, is more like the bridge club, and I think that sounds like a <em>fantastic</em> way to play.  Take it a few steps further and you get Jacks' "Open Game" which also sounds like a ton of fun.
<blockquote>And no doubt, it's a bummer when a campaign ends. I was also bummed out to move away from college. Before that, I'm sure I was bummed out to move away from the town I lived in for 10 years, and later to move away from high school, and even away from junior high. I was bummed to leave Raleigh NC...</blockquote>
This is my only follow-up.  Are you saying that a campaign ending also ends the group that was playing it?  Cause you seem to be equating the bummer of a campaign ending with the bummer of a community ending.  Do you not pick up another game after the first one is done, and play different characters in a different setting with a new succession of loosely-linked individual adventures?                        </div>

I know I'm wishing for something that doesn't exist, but I'd love to see some numbers on this. My take on traditional play -- or at least the kind of play I grew up with -- was definitely more in the modular vein. I thought that was the most common way to play, but all my evidence is anecdotal.                        </div>

                            On epic story line as traditional play - I'm curious what time frame you're basing this on. When I got outside my small circle of friends in 1979 or so, play at MIT was definitely very episodic. Most campaigns allowed characters to move from campaign to campaign. The modules of the time were fairly episodic, though granted, there was somewhat of a story line to the Giants and Drow modules, but it wasn't much of a story line. Outside of those modules, things were much more episodic. But late 80s, things were changing, especially with Dragonlance. Dungeon Magazine continued (and still continues) to be a source of episodic modules.<br/><br/>Some of the more "mature" MIT games were trying to get away from episodic play, but I suspect they were heading deep into sim territory, and the long running plots were not carefully crafted by the GM, but things that were happening, and the PCs action would interract with those things, sometimes changing them, sometimes squashing the PCs.<br/><br/>My freshman year in college I did encounter a group that was playing an episodic story, and after one session, I pretty quickly saw the flaws in that idea, and I guess I saw the potential for illusionism.<br/><br/>So at least for me, traditional, old school gaming does not in the least require some epic story line. I've never played that way, and any time I've started to use a module that was pushing that kind of thing, I bailed real fast.<br/><br/>For the most part, a campaign ending has resulted in ending the group. Almost always has there at least been significant turnover. One exception was last years switch from Arcana Evolved to Cold Iron, everyone switched, though one player did drop out (and the campaign lasted just a couple sessions after that). I'm struggling to think of any other exception where the whole group started the next campaign. Now since the AE campaign, up until now, there have been 3 players following along. There was some significant overlap between a few campaigns in college.<br/><br/>But I was not attempting to claim all those bummer things were exactly the same. Sometimes it's loss of community, sometimes it's just something else passing, though I guess in the main, it's loss (or change) of community.<br/><br/>But that's also why I think the ending of the campaigns in this way is natural, because the successfull campaigns most often end due to changing community (the Arcana Evolved campaign was one of the few successfull campaigns that didn't end because of changing community, the most recent campaign, a RuneQuest campaign, was not entirely successfull, but also died in part due to community changes).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            I have two modes of play (three, if you count the boardgames).<br/><br/><b>tabletop campaigns or one-shots</b><br/><br/>We either play a mini-campaign (when we know about how long the game runs), an "infinite campaign" (in which we don't) or one-shots (one session, or two if it's just too long for one). There are no set playing dates; we try to reserve a playing date a week or few weeks before with a reservation matrix (an email with dates of the next month; players mark the days when they can play, can probably play and cannot play - then we pick a date from those which fits all). We usually play once every two weeks or once a month, depending on free times. Campaign's and mini-campaigns have set players (my current Fading Suns has four), with one-shots, the GM usually sends an invitation email to players of his choosing.  I usually play campaigns with a certain group and draw players to one-shots from a pool of about 20-30 players, consisting of folks I've been playing with and know. I usually play on weekday evenings, with session length of 6-7 hours (or more with one-shots). <br/><br/>I usually play once or twice a month.<br/><br/><b>LARP's</b><br/><br/>LARP's are usually advertised two or three months prior to the event (some even longer); invitation-only games could have a slightly shorter notice time. I make the decision to participate well before the event, if I have nothing else scedhuled. Participation time ranges from a long evening to a weekend, plus the preparation time. I usually play in few LARP's during one year - maybe four or five if there are lot of invitation-only games or a running campaign and one or two if not. <br/><br/><b>Boardgames</b><br/><br/>I play RISK online and make my moved (almost) daily, other board games only occasionally.                        </div>

                            Frank, <br/><br/>My (highly anecdotal but pretty widespread) experience is that for many D&amp;D folks the style you describe is pretty close to the norm. For folks who were more into WW games, or the plot based games that sprung up around the time of TORG and such metaplot badboys, the style that Josh talks about is pretty normal. <br/><br/>Which is one of the reasons I've long been wondering how much of what we do around our individual tables (and why we do it) is really as much the same as we think it is.                        </div>

                            Brand,<br/><br/>I've always thought that these days there is a lot of story-line D&amp;D. I just detached from D&amp;D play before it started, but I've encountered hints of it in my recruiting. It mostly hasn't been an issue with the players I've recruited because I'm pretty up front about what my play style is (especially since I finally decided to ditch "role play not roll play").<br/><br/>I do think it would be helpfull when people talk about "traditional play" that they at least identify the time frame because 70s, 80s, and 90s play (not necessarily exactly adhering to those decades) have decided differences (70s in my experience characterized by free movement between campaigns, even the campaigns with a strong sense of setting and at least some kind of ongoing background, the 80s by campaigns that were more customized, with ongoing background, but still not full fledged plotting, and the 90s by the rise of the so called story games) - but that's also just my impression. Really all I can speak for is my small circle of exposure (which was probably significant in the late 70s when I was gaming at MIT, and must less so after that, though I got at least some exposure to what other gamers were doing through 8 years of the RPI games club, and several years of the NC State games club, not to mention seeing how the game systems and supplements were evolving).<br/><br/>And you're right, I think there's a lot of variety. Some people I think are good at exposing what's really going on (and when Ron engages with someone in AP he really pulls out the dynamics nicely), others seem to just assume that everyone plays the same (and I do get that with some of the players I've recruited - though my best example of a player "just assuming" was in the late 70s when I ran a game at Boskone, this player showed up with a spell caster, and just started making all these botch rolls or something [I basically ignored what he was doing], clearly assuming that everyone played by his group's house rules).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            Don't forget, either, that not all players will be doing the "latest thing". I played for a couple of years in the mid-90s with a group that had been playing for a long time and were still using the 1st edition rules, houseruled a bit to make magic-users more flexible and with some character classes and non-weapon proficiencies imported from 2e. They were happy with the game they had and didn't buy a lot of supplements or anything, so trends had pretty much passed them by.<br/><br/>They're still playing, and probably still playing much the same for all I know.                        </div>

                            While true, Mike, I'm not sure the purchase of books is really an indication of the social context in which people play.                        </div>

<b>LARPs</b><br/><br/>So far, they've been at conventions, advertised some time in advance. They usually half-sign up before the game, with people I don't <i>know</i>, as such, but I've had a drink with or played with before. The other half are people who sign up on the day: they're the enthusiastic ones and lots of fun to play with.<br/><br/>I'm the GM, so I'm all showman and host and "Welcome to the game!" and covering up the cracks. <br/><br/>There's a set time limit, usually about three hours. The rules are organised so that characters don't die (or, if they do, they come back as ghosts, so the player keeps playing). It's high-energy, with a brief wind-down at the end, and we go to the bar afterwards.<br/><br/><b>Occasional tabletops</b><br/><br/>Every couple of months, I call my friend Tyler and suggest playing a game. We either play a boardgame or a tabletop RPG. It's a one-shot: we play the game for that night and it's understood we won't play again.<br/><br/>Just recently, there's been some online stuff, but that's too new to think about right now.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
