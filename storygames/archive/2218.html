                    As I stated on the other thread, we are having a good time playing producerless PTA. The specifics can be found on that other thread.<br/>
<br/>
Players: both of us have been playing on and off mainstream RPGs since 1993. Including GURPS, Storyteller, Castle Falkenstein, SAGA, D&amp;D and others. We also love boardgames and Return of the Heroes and Ticket to Ride are some of the favorites.<br/>
<br/>
Theme/scenario: we chose Middle-Ages b/c we have seen a lot of stuff related to King Arthur and A Game of Thrones, giving us a very good place to start. The tone is supposed to be serious, heroic feats allowed. The location probably somewhere in northern Britain.<br/>
<br/>
The Kingdom is just coming out of a civil war but the king was able to retain his throne.<br/>
<br/>
Protagonists: <br/>
Sir Kyle - younger son of a duke that was very close to the king. The duke died during the war but asked the king to make Kyle a member of the royal guard to give him something since his older brother (the heir) is likely to screw him up. Some of the other knights of the guard don't like this b/c they earned their position by merit and Kyle as a favor. So, his issue is to prove himself worthy and his nemesis is the chief of the guard.<br/>
<br/>
Princess Olivia - daughter of the king. Her issue is that she is uncomfortable with the social contrasts. She is loved by the peasants, servants, etc. She has connections with the wise man of the city. Nemesis her older sister who is a classic princess. <br/>
<br/>
Other characters:<br/>
King - a nice guy.<br/>
Queen - ambitious.<br/>
Heir (prince is older than his sisters) - for some reason the fact that he will be king some day is reason for concern.<br/>
<br/>
Episode 1 - The game starts with Kyle being named a member of the guard. He loses the conflict and sounds really silly on his speech. There is a tournament in honor of the victory in the war and in honor of Kyle's father. During the festival, the younger prince is kidnapped. The unorthodox princess Olivia pursues the kidnappers, Sir Kyle follows her. They do enough to delay the bandits and the guard arrives to capture them and our heroes are in trouble. Sir Kyle is forbidden by his nemesis to participate in the tournament that meant a lot to him. So, he convinces the king to allow him to participate and his nemesis gets upset. In the final joust Kyle goes against the nemesis and wins the conflict which means that Kyle loses the match but ends up looking good (he had the chance to win but doesn't take advantage due to fair play) and gets his nemesis less upset. Olivia learns that the kidnappers live in a forest close to the castle and learns the leader's name. Very little is known about these people. Sir Kyle gets closer to Lady Meredith who has no sibblings and is heiress of her family. They were friends during childhood.<br/>
