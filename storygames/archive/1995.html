<b>Once Upon A Time...</b><br/>There was a forum filled with clever gamers, curious to learn new things about how to play.  And one of them wanted to talk about different ways that traditional folk-story-telling might be something to learn from, here and there, for a few games.  And so he started to tell it as a story that others could continue, because being all post-modern and shit struck him as funny.<br/><br/><b>His name was Jack.</b><br/>And this mattered, because it meant that the audience knew immediately upon hearing his name that he was a <i>clever </i>hero.  He was going to outsmart his foes - he wasn't going to use clever tactics in fights, so much; it's more that the whole field of play, where he was involved, would change into a contest of intelligence, because that's how "Jack" stories go.<br/><br/><b>And he was the Third Son.</b><br/>Which is also important, because it means that the posters, telling the story, could send out his brothers Hans and Frank ahead of him.  This would let the posters explore (and even create) the territory before introducing the hero.  Also, since we all know that Hans and Frank are doomed to fail to make room for Jack, they could be used as examples of all kinds of pitfalls along the way, and could fall into them and get totally screwed.  <br/><br/><b>They lived in a small cottage, a long time ago, in the land of Nowhere-In-Particular.</b><br/>Because keeping the setting nice and vague, as well as generically familiar, means that the suprises they would face along the way would have more power to actually suprise everyone, to their great delight and amusement.<br/><br/><b>And they were terribly threatened.</b><br/>Mostly by poverty, which let Jack be creative rather than relying on equipment, as we shall see, but probably also by the Terrible Archetypal Menace, which had a lot of desirable things, providing Jack and his brothers with motivation.<br/><br/><b>The Terrible Archetypal Menace...</b><br/>...Was terribly arche<i>typical</i>, which helped the audience grasp it's nature and menace immediately, and get on with the business of actually playing.  Of course, the Menace likely had a special weakness that required an improbable quest, but that comes later.  A more cleverly thought-up menace would have distracted from Jack, our hero, and stolen some of his valuable spotlight time, which his player loves more than gold, and thus only worth creating if it's special stuff actually mattered to Jack and his adventures.<br/><br/>...Anyone care to continue?                </div>

<b>The speaker gestured expressively.</b><br/>When describing how Jack waved goodbye to his first brother.  This gave them a visual cue to what was occuring - one that wouldn't linger to distract them, and one which got a bit of attention, as movement generally does.                        </div>

<b>The Speaker made special note...</b><br/>of the Large Oak Tree, where the troubled woman was, because the Large Oak Tree was to become a motif. The Speaker noted that Hans had seen the Large Oak Tree before, and would see it again. Hans walked past without another thought, even though the readers made note of it. There wasn't a lot of meaning associated with the Large Oak Tree at this point - just importance.                        </div>

<b>The Speaker handed off the stick...</b><br/>Which signified "who is telling the story" to another.  With it went the authority to answer questions asked by hecklers, even if only by saying 'hush, child'.<br/><br/><b>The new speaker described a peril</b><br/>Which Hans would have known of if he had been pure of heart and helped the old person or animal in trouble.  He laid down the method by which it destroyed those that did not understand it, and the audience noted the device and began to think on how Jack would overcome it.                        </div>
