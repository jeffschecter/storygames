Basically, I'm just not at all sure what I've got is anywhere near solid enough to try to hold to the "rules" as written with any great rigor, so I'm willing an planning to change and add and tweak things as we go.<br/>This will be my first attempt at playing/running something i've written myself.  hell, i've never even been one to do much house-ruling or hacking.  i'm a bit nervous about it!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194869/#Comment_194869" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-28T10:42:29+00:00" title="February 28, 2009 10:42AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/><br/>Honestly, half the battle is just being willing to change as you go, which you've already got covered.

We'd start playing and hit a rule that didn't seem to work, so we'd toss around ideas for what the rule was trying to accomplish and why it was or wasn't accomplishing it.  Then we'd play a bit more during which we'd start creating a list of things needing more definition.<br/><br/>Then the next session we'd get a little farther refining some of the things that seemed to be working until we ran into the next problem area (or just unwritten yet area), and so on.<br/><br/>The kind of things I've found playstorming good at is finding the details that get missed about procedure.  If you come to your group with a complete game and you run it, and the players are actually "playing it" rather than "playstorming" it, and it works...there are probably a whole host of things you did or that your group as a whole just understands to do.  Plus the willingness of players who are "playing" to just go-with-the-flow and not disrupt the game makes it even harder to spot holes.  This leads to me getting cranky when the text is published without all of those things having been recorded in the text.<br/><br/>When we Playstormed on the other hand, a whole host of critical decisions points were laid bare highlighting the oft repeated question "who gets to do that?".  When you're writing text you can write ambiguous sentences like "Decide what scene to frame next." (which is an example of horrible BTW).  When you're actually writing rules as you play the missing pieces becomes painfully obvious...WHO decides, and for what purpose.  Since someone is actually about to DO that thing, you have to actually make a decision about how it gets done.  Then you can write that down so that other groups will know how to do that thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195075/#Comment_195075" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T12:32:53+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>When you're writing text you can write ambiguous sentences like "Decide what scene to frame next."</blockquote>My text currently has a lot of spots like this.  But as I was writing them I was well aware of their shitty-ness.  I kept thinking "Dang, that's a terribly vague way to put that."  So I think that's good, right?  I mean, I at least know I need to clean some of that stuff up.  I'm really just waiting to try it out a bit first, see what <i>feels</i> like the right procedure at the table, what feels natural.<br/><br/>The big thing on my mind, and the big reason I want to try playstorming this thing fairly soon is mechanics.  I'm not that great with math, and so I'm not sure how my probabilities are.  Plus I keep thinking of new things that seem like cool ideas in my head, but I'm at least half-convinced that in play they'll be over-complicated or just stupid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195089/#Comment_195089" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T12:58:10+00:00" title="March  2, 2009 12:58PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eppy has much more experience at doing it than I so he can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think Playstorming will help much with math issues unless you've just got something completely backwards (like saying roll under when you meant roll over).  Only the most obvious math issues will show up in only a few rolls.  Other issues (of the sort that will eventually be figured out and optimized by players in a way that leads to play radically different from what you wanted) take either some long term campaign play (or lots of repeated play if your game is short form) or someone REALLY good at groking and breaking mechanics.  <br/><br/>What I've found Playstorming to be most useful for is:<br/><br/>1) helping to bring focus on what the game is about...because the designer will need to be able to answer that question when the group starts brainstorming ideas (Seth and I bounced a TON of totally unsuitable mechanics ideas off of Keith before he was able to decide what he really wanted out of Dream Palace).  The process of filtering out the suggestions that feel wrong from the ones that feel right will really help you understand your goals.<br/><br/>2) specifying procedures.  Yeah, its great that you recognize some of your text is vague.  But once you start to playstorm that bit you'll be forced...just by the reality of having people sitting there actually doing things...to specify what the real person is really supposed to do right now.  Chances are you'll wind up specifying it in a totally unfun way at first (cuz if you knew what way was fun you wouldn't have written it vaguely to begin with)...but eventually you'll hit on the procedure that rings true for the game.  So yes, seeing what feel natural and what feels awkward or fiddly or WTF is a big part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195133/#Comment_195133" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T15:10:31+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  3:10PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Only the most obvious math issues will show up in only a few rolls.

Mostly, as with procedures, I wanted to be sure that the mechanics don't feel wrong.  Plus there are things that are a function of both the math and play-style/procedure.

I mean, in this case I was writing things vaguely primarily because I was focusing on getting mechanics written down rather than anything else, but that just goes to show I haven't really thought much at all about the other at-table procedures, which certainly means I don't have any particular fun ones in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195136/#Comment_195136" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T15:13:06+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  3:13PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should bring it to GoPlay BTW...there may be a chance to get a Playstorm in                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195142/#Comment_195142" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-02T15:28:26+00:00" title="March  2, 2009  3:28PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>You should bring it to GoPlay BTW...there may be a chance to get a Playstorm in</blockquote>Ugh.  Not unless I can get my friend to skip his usual night at the bar on Thursday to try it that night first.  I'm way too self-conscious about this thing to try it for the first time with anyone besides people I've known for 15 years.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
