This one is my favorite\u2026<br/><br/>1. <br/>I announce, "<b>we're going to play heroes in a fantasy world filled with monsters, treasure, and adventure! You play the heroes and I will play everything else and teach you how to play. It's fast an easy.</b>" <br/><br/>2. <br/>I give everyone their own personal d20 and a blank sheet that says: <br/><br/>- "What is your hero's name? Circle one of the following names\u2026" followed by name examples.<br/>- "You heroes are all friends. Introduce your hero and write the names of your hero's friends here\u2026"<br/>- "Tell me what you want your hero to do and then roll your 20 sided die to see if they succeed. If you roll 10 or higher, your hero succeeds!"<br/>- "Place stickers here\u2026" with designated spaces to place stickers (stickers represent new rules, see below). <br/><br/>3. <br/>I write down "monster", "child", and "gold" on 3 separate index cards.<br/><br/>4. <br/>I announce, "<b>you see a monster trying to rob a child carrying a bag of gold. What do you do?</b>"<br/><br/>5. <br/>Everyone takes a turn saying what they want their hero to do, rolling a d20, and then describing how they succeed or fail. If a player introduces new people, places, or things\u2026 I write its name on an index card and place it in the middle of the table. <br/><br/>6. <br/>After everyone has had a turn, I introduce a new rule or part of the game. <br/><br/>Everything from, "what do you look like" to "now you have hit points" to "here is your miniature" to "this is how many squares you can move" to "now the monsters can attack back". <br/><br/>7. <br/>Add new rules to your character sheet.<br/><br/>Each rule is printed on its own sticker (or letter labels). When a new rule is introduced, you grab a sticker and place it on your character sheet. If we introduce a new rule that updates or cancels out an existing rule, just place the new sticker over the old one.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323159/#Comment_323159" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T01:49:59+00:00" title="May  5, 2011  1:49AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I teach D&amp;D to children (ages 7-12), I begin by giving them a choice between the four basic character classes: fighter, magic user, cleric and rogue. Most children nowadays are familiar enough with video games with D&amp;D elements so I don't really have to explain much about the world or the different characters. Usually someone asks which character is the strongest, to which I reply that they are all equally powerful, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>I then hand them pregens with the following information: name, class, race, physical appearance, equipment, skills and spells (or at-will powers, if we're playing 4E). The sheets also list Attack Bonus (the character's highest stat modifier) and AC. I take a few minutes to answer questions about the different skills and spells.<br/><br/>The introduction scenario I use is almost always the same: "You all live in a village called the Rat's Tail, at the edge of the civilized lands, where the King's Road ends abruptly and the fertile plains give way to a dark and unexplored forest, where monsters and magical beings live, and to a mountain range spotted with icy caps and fiery volcanoes. You are the best and brightest of your village: the ones who are always called upon when there is trouble. Last night, while you were on patrol, a young child named Timmy, only 3 years old, was kidnapped from his home by monsters. [Pointing at one of them at random]: he is your little brother. You are now in the forest, following the tracks left by the kidnappers. You have walked half a day when you finally spot, in a clearing ahead of you, six skeletons armed with scythes and hatchets. One of them is carrying young Rilke on his shoulder; the child seems terrified. You are well-hidden behind some thick bushes, and the skeletons haven't noticed you yet. What do you do?"<br/><br/>I run the encounter without adding new elements, so the children become used to the basic principles of "roll d20, add attack bonus, check against enemy's AC" and "roll d20, add skill bonus, check against DC", and the notions of critical hits and critical misses.  I always tell the players the target numbers in advance, and explain the rationale behind them: "Okay, so you want to climb the tree. There are some solid branches you can use, so it's not a difficult task. Adding your climbing skill to the roll, you need to get 10 or higher". Sometimes I ask them questions and use their answers to determine the AC: "so that tree you're climbing, how high would you say it is? 10 meters? Well then, it's going to be difficult."<br/><br/>I don't use miniatures for the first encounter, and I don't draw a map unless one of the players ask me to. I also don't use initiative and turn order: people take actions when they can think of something interesting to do, and once every couple of player actions the skeletons take an action of their own. The skeleton's tactic is to keep the PCs occupied while one of them runs away with the child.<br/><br/>If there's time left, I give the players a non-violent challenge, such as bargaining with the forest spirits for safe passage and information. I then end the session with a cliff-hanger, usually with the players noticing or walking into an ambush of some sort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323168/#Comment_323168" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-05T03:50:53+00:00" title="May  5, 2011  3:50AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's so awesome.

(<img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":blush:"/>: I kinda want to play now, too).  It would be fun to redevelop/hack D&amp;D so that all the mechanics are separate from each other and optional so that you could incorporate them or not as you went along.

Maybe you can help diagnose my problem.<br><br>Lately I've had trouble rping with my 6-year old - she's very unwilling to make contributions anymore. I don't know why. She's definitely completely capable of contributing - we've had some really good sessions in the past and she's even GM'd me once in a game she made up!  <br>These days, "What do you do?" is usually met with "I don't know." Offering her a choice helps a lot. "Well, you could try to talk. Or fight." "Well, you could look for clues - or go ask a teacher for help." Generalizing it to an apocalypse-worldish set of moves sometimes works too. <br>Another thing that sometimes helps is me whispering, "Don't worry, whatever you do, it'll all turn out okay." Or sometimes pressing, "Well, why don't you want to do X?"<br/>But often not. Often, play devolves to me making up a story by myself. Or worse, she doesn't like my contributions either, and we have to quit and do something else.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm too close to it, and that's why I can't figure out something that's obvious.

They took to it quickly enough, and had fun with the first session (I'm running them through Keep on the Borderlands). Me, I had a blast, but there was one bit that really summed it up for me.<br/><br/>One of them is a magic-user, and out of the kindness of my heart I started him out with a wand of magic missiles (with six charges). They're fighting the kobold chieftain and his ninja-kobold concubines (I presume -- he's got five females kobolds at his feet, and they have combat stats, so clearly... ninja-kobold concubines), and they have the chieftain down to 1 hp. The M-U zaps him with the wand and kills him.<br/><br/><b>Me:</b> The bolt of arcane energy hits him in the throat and he falls to the floor, dead.<br/><b>Player:</b> Awesome.<br/><b>Me:</b> No, wait -- his head <i>pops off</i>, and a geyser of dark blood springs from his severed neck.<br/><b>Player:</b> AWESOME!<br/><br/>Now, they know that when it comes to that sort of thing, I'm just making shit up. The kobold's dead either way. But I <i>love</i> that the additional detail of decapitating the kobold elicited such a response from this guy. It really drove home what a difference it makes, especially for new players, to make sure the action gets good, colorful narration.<br/><br/>(Another great moment was when one of them suggested throwing a flask full of oil into the pit full of giant rats, and setting them all on fire. "Kill it with fire" isn't just a gamer instinct -- it's a <i>human</i> instinct.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323370/#Comment_323370" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-06T20:39:56+00:00" title="May  6, 2011  8:39PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><br/>- what would usually happen in your games once she said what she wanted to do?

Usually we incorporate skills in the game first. Then after a while we ask, which skills do you use the most? If it's all charisma based skills, we ask... are you charismatic? If yes, then make charisma a 16. Is there something you almost never roll? Make that stat a 10. <br/><br/>Generally there is no issue with character concepts because they don't exist till we play.

The sack of character sheets, DM info, miniatures, maps, etc. that I lug back and forth to class is a pain but I don't want to do away with the physicality of the game; the real issue is that setting up and packing away this stuff before and after each session takes a significant fraction of the time we actually spend teaching; the kids really like to take their character sheets home but there's an ever-present risk that they'll get lost, so having all this stuff stored by an app and printed as necessary would rock.

I don't think skill is really the problem; anyone who likes kids and roleplaying could do it, it's the procedures that need to be passed on. Having an app that guides the teacher through the process of guiding the kids would be awesome for seeding an program in every school where there's enough teachers and staff who grew up playing RPGs to embrace it.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I'll do a Kickstarter to fund this; I have a few leads to follow on app developers, but other suggestions for people who might have the know-how and interest would be appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323459/#Comment_323459" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-08T07:49:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2011  7:49AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a picnic yesterday with 50+ gamers and my friend had to leave early because he was going to teach his teenage daughter and 4 of her girlfriends how to play Pathfinder as they've decided they want to form their own weekly gaming group!

Tracking fictional content seemed to be as much of an issue as tracking rules. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>I think this approach takes the AW mandate "play to find out" and makes the addendum "...how the game works."

(<img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":blush:"/>: I kinda want to play now, too).  It would be fun to redevelop/hack D&amp;D so that all the mechanics are separate from each other and optional so that you could incorporate them or not as you went along.

What people remember is also a good indicator of what people are interested in. So I take a page out of Mouse Guard and have everyone help deliver a prologue before each game. I'll take all the index cards listing people, places, and things... lay them on the table, and then have everyone tell me what happened last game. As people note details that apply to specific people, places, and things, I will write that information in summary on the back of their index cards. It's not perfect, but it helps me focus on GMing material that the players care about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323508/#Comment_323508" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-08T20:47:20+00:00" title="May  8, 2011  8:47PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Where are Your Keys" by Willem Larsen has some rules about teaching the game which I LOVE.<br/># Bite sized pieces - present the game one bit at a time (the stickers accomplish this)<br/># Don't kill fairy's - let people discover things them-self, don't just tell them<br/># Obviously - make it obvious.<br/># No Learning - when you do those above things, the game naturally seeps in with out it feeling like you have to learn it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323532/#Comment_323532" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-09T05:42:12+00:00" title="May  9, 2011  5:42AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are all great teaching rules!<br/><br/>Letting people discover rules themselves allows for immediate buy in. If I explain how you can knock someone down, but it isn't relevant to what they want to do right now... 3 things often happen... people don't fully listen, people listen but forget, or people learn to listen more than explore and only do the things I tell them. <br/><br/>There are people who want to know all the rules before they do anything. But they are likely so passionate about rules and so self motivated... just give them the rulebook and let them absorb it all. Effective teaching is fitting the right techniques to the right people.<br/><br/>What I see happen with boardgames heavy on strategy... people feel if you don't teach most of the rules upfront... then you can't possibly engage with the game's overall strategy. And this is often true, but if someone quits before they start playing, they also won't engage with the game's overall strategy. Less extreme, if you overwhelm someone, they will be more focused on trying to remember rules and trying to use them correctly instead of making larger strategic decisions. <br/><br/>These are some of the techniques that make video games so effective. If I play Plants vs Zombies, the game not only walks me through the rules but also presents 1 rule at a time while allowing me to start playing quickly with less options and then introduce more options as I gain experience and decide to keep playing. <br/><br/>You're starting to have 4 year olds playing with iPads and 8 year olds with their own personal iTouch devices. They have the ability to learn as they go, fast forward, rewind, and replay as often as they would like. The idea of handing them a 300 page rule book is seemingly insanity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
