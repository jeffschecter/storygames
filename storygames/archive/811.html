                    So for a while I wanted to run "X-Crawl", basically a D&amp;D meets reality TV show/American Gladiators game, with PTA.  I had the X-Crawl book for a few weeks, and elements of it seem so friggin' cool, but I think the ties to d20 really killed it from being what it advertises itself as. It says you play reality TV show guests doing dungeon crawls during the day on primetime TV for fortune and glory, and at night you party, get involved with off-screen rivalries and the like. Unfortunately, while the book talks about the possibilities for all that cool latter stuff, the rules totally don't support that kind of play.<br/><br/>OK, Rant over.<br/><br/>Anyway, PTA seems to be the perfect game to play with it, however, I definitely see the need for some task resolution: There IS a good deal of dungeon crawling intended, at least 50% or more, and just waving it all away with conflict-style resolution would seem a little weird.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought of a bastard evil hybrid where basically you take standard PTA, and add Hit Points and Fame Points. <br/><br/>Hit Points are just like in D&amp;D. For shits and giggles, let's just say that everyone starts with 40, and when they hit 0 they are knocked unconscious, face serious injury, or even die on huge events. They never really rise, and they reset every episode back to 40.<br/><br/>Fame starts out with everyone between 2-5 (player choice) and the absolute maximum is 40 points, which means you're pretty much the Brett Favre of the X-Crawl.<br/><br/>All they are are resources that you gamble when you set up conflicts. For hit-point conflicts, you use 1d6es to navigate damage and the like.<br/><br/>So basically, conflict resolution in the X-Crawl scenes would look something like this:<br/><br/><i>PL: "In this next room, I want Marta to sneak up behind the bugbears and cut them apart"<br/><br/>GM: "OK, if you do that, though, I'm thinking the stakes are this: If you succeed, you get behind them and take them out. If you fail, you will be scene and they'll do 2d6 damage to you before your friends arrive."<br/><br/>PL: "Hmmm. Well, that's kinda risky for me.  Maybe if I succeed, I take them out in such a cool way that I'd also gain a point of Fame for my manuvers?"<br/><br/>GM: "Maybe not. I did just give you a Fate Point a couple minutes ago for your other moves. I don't want to hand them out too freely yet. How about I reduce that damage to 1d6 if you lose?"<br/><br/>PL: "Sure, let's do that" (they then pull out the cards and play PTA normally)</i><br/><br/>It certainly adds an edge to the dungeon parts, and makes the Players want to get behind their PCs succeeding, which isn't really solidly on line with the point of PTA. However, it basically extends the conflicts out longer, adds new resources to play with in stakes-setting, and adds more to the fighty bits than wrapping it up with vague massive conflict-setting.  I think it still helps it retain some gamey-game D&amp;D-ness, without turning it into a frankenstein's monster of patchwork rules.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            So, you'd earn your fanmail directly by giving the audience what it wants during the Dungeon Crawl part of the show?                        </div>

                            Well, you'd get fanmail for doing and saying cool stuff that others like, as always.  It would just happen that some of that would come from doing things that the players ("audience") think would be cool in the task-smackdown section.  But really, no real modification to fanmail.  Just to the conflict resolution.                        </div>

                            You could keep Hit Points as a seperate deck of cards. Each player would have 52 HP that way. Negotiate as you said for Fame, and keep fame as a seperate pile of chips. You could cash in those chips for either your own pile of cards as per normal fanmail rules, or for temporary boosts in your screen presence or your attributes.<br/><br/>If you want to keep the random HP loss, you could keep dice around, or you could do a bidding system:<br/><br/>"I want to sneak in and kill the bugbears!"<br/> "Okay, two bugbears and some low lying water means that you'll need at least 7 to sneak in. Killing them will be 6 a piece. You'll need a total of 19. How many cards do you want to do that in?"<br/>"Hmm, 17. I have seen too many face cards tonight, I'll bet I can do it in 3 cards!"<br/>"Okay, draw and reveal!"<br/>"Hmm, a Queen! That's 13! Next is a deuce! Damn. Okay, and finally, I got ... a 3! Crap! That's 18!"<br/>"Ha, gotcha! They notice you sneaking up, and deal the difference in damage ... give me another card ... yes! I got an Ace! I get to narrate!"<br/><br/>"Jeez, I'm down to 42 minus an Ace and the crawl hasn't even really begun ..."<br/><br/>Or something like that.                        </div>

                            Wouldn't it be easier to simply shift back and forth? That is, basically use D&amp;D play of entire dungeons as the resolution method for any scene in the dungeon. And then break back into PTA play for the rest of the game? Allowing for, as mentioned, Fan Mail to be given for the dungeon play? <br/>
<br/>
I think it'd work.<br/>

                            I like the system-shifting idea, because D&amp;D supports just about exactly half the fun of X-Crawl.  The question is of course how to connect the two systems.  Giving Fan Mail connects the dungeon crawl to the social world of the game, but the things you do in the celebrity world should also feed back into the dungeon crawl somehow.  (For example, if your ex-boyfriend is running a Crawl you're doing, that should definitely impact your performance.)  Maybe the things you do outside the game affect how many 'points' the DJ can use to build the dungeon for you?  So you may or may not have better stats because you went to that big party and worked it last night, but you can mechanically affect the crawl environment through the PTA section of the game.<br/><br/>On the other hand, D&amp;D is S.L.O.W. when it comes to big combats, so maybe D&amp;D isn't the best system for being in the Crawl itself.  On the other hand, I do like the crunchiness of it for feeling like you're really in the thick of dungeon crawling with limited resources to succeed.<br/><br/>(I also desperately want someone to run an X-Crawl game, because I've been wanting to play an action-satire-romance campaign of X-Crawl since the day I first saw it.  But that's a different story.)<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            On a somewhat related note, Clinton, Remi and I have discussed alternating between Memoir '44 and PTA to tell WWII or Korean War stories.  It would add a certain frisson to M44 to know that your PC was leading that little clump of infantry getting pummelled on Hill 304.                        </div>

                            A solid round of M44 lasts 45 minutes, maybe an hour!  It was Clintons initial idea - I think the plan was that each of us would have a commander on opposite sides of the conflict as protagonist.  So we'd play some PTA and fit in a game of M44 where appropriate for the evening, probably right in the middle.  I suspect what you'd get is a pretty powerful anti-war show.  <br/><br/>I second the call for a Donjon PTA mash-up.  Shifting from PTA to D20 seems like it would be jarring.                        </div>
