(He was working with the title "A:/GON" but that's just too old school for me).<br/><br/>The groundwork for the conversion was done by John's Shadowrun conversion and Dave Younce's DAGON. The goal is to produce something a lot like CyberPunk 2020 in feel (originally we were thinking of Ghost in the Shell, but I want something with a larger scope to work from), although I've managed to almost completely miss out on the Humanity aspect of the game (but instead have managed to keep the core part of playing the game: shopping for new toys!)<br/><br/>The first part of the conversion is the stats, before going into Chargen. These draw a lot from John's Shadowrun conversion.<br/><br/><b>Fate = Edge</b> (as you gain more edge, you get better at what you do and take bigger risks and load up with more cyberware, but pushing the edge will come back and bite you and finally you burn out, pushed over the edge)<br/><br/><b>Glory = Rep</b> <br/><br/><b>Divine Favor = Toys</b> (having the right toys is key - and letting them be a background feature that you pull out when you need them saves on all the insanity of packing a thousand different mini-toys before every job. Everything on the Divine Favor list can be explained with some awesome hardware. A boost to a roll is because of your sneaksuit, smoke grenade, drugs, whatever.)<br/><br/><b>Oaths = Favors</b><br/><br/><br/><b>Core Abilities</b><br/>Awareness = Insight<br/>Reflexes = Grace<br/>Body = Might<br/>Cool = Spirit<br/><br/><b>Hack Abilities</b><br/>Credibility = Orate (Social Hacking)<br/>Hacking = Electronic Hacking<br/>Medtech = Heal (Body Hacking)<br/>Technical = Hardware Hacking<br/><br/><b>Ops Abilities</b><br/>Athletics = Athletics<br/>Contacts = Lore<br/>Stealth = Cunning<br/>Martial Arts = Hand to Hand<br/><br/><b>Fighting Abilities</b><br/>Firefight = Mid-range<br/>Support = Long-range<br/>Close Combat = Short-range<br/>Evasion = Defense                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer" title="mjbauer"><img alt="mjbauer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/222/nPG4NFOY76VNT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mjbauer">mjbauer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235048/#Comment_235048" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T11:57:08+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 11:57AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235056/#Comment_235056" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T12:21:18+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 12:21PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to consider to model firefight vs melee is cover.

You have two options most characters have a name and a nickname that helps identify them (Jimmy the Roach, Two-Tone Johnny, Billy and his Smartgun, Molly Razorgirl), while some characters are already so immersed in the street that they are only known by their street nickname (The Roach, Two-Tone, Smartgunner, Razorgirl). If you have a name and nickname, then you have a name die of d6 and a starting Fate of 0. If you have already lost your name to the street, then you have a name die of d8 and a starting Fate of 8.<br/><br/><b>Traits</b><br/>The punks that pull themselves out of the gutters and start to earn a name for themselves always have something that sets them apart. Something that makes them special. Each character picks two traits from the following list, and then explains how they get them. Some of the traits have suggestions. Typically this has something to do with the character's background and special training, cybernetic enhancements, or personality. A character cannot take the same trait twice. Often one or both of these traits will end up reflected in the character's nickname.<br/><br/>+2 to Awareness rolls \u2013 Paranoia, Enhanced optics<br/>+2 to Reflexes rolls \u2013 Wired reflexes, Enhanced nervous system<br/>+2 to Body rolls \u2013 Grafted muscle, Bone replacement<br/>+2 to Cool rolls \u2013 Slicker than grease, Endorphin boosters<br/>+2 to Credibility rolls \u2013 Famous rocker, Big time media<br/>+2 to Hacking rolls \u2013 Interface plugs<br/>+2 to Medtech rolls \u2013 Trauma Team!<br/>+2 to Technical rolls \u2013 Jury rigging, Toolkit Cyberhand<br/>+2 to Athletics rolls \u2013 Enhanced musculature, Adrenaline booster<br/>+2 to Contacts rolls \u2013 Dataterm linkup, Implanted cellphone<br/>+2 to Stealth rolls \u2013 Coolsuit, Sneaky, Camoskins<br/><br/>+1 Range for short-range weapons (weapons with ranges up to 2) \u2013 Skillchip, Combat Crystal<br/>+1 Range for long-range weapons (weapons with ranges over 2) \u2013 Skillchip, Targeting Optic<br/><br/>+1 damage to machines<br/>+1 damage to the man<br/>+1 damage to streetscum<br/>+1 damage to cyborgs <br/><br/>+2 to positioning roll when fighting machines<br/>+2 to positioning roll when fighting the man<br/>+2 to positioning roll when fighting streetscum<br/>+2 to positioning roll when fighting cyborgs<br/>+2 to positioning roll when fighting inside<br/>+2 to positioning roll when fighting outside<br/>+2 to positioning roll in bright conditions<br/>+2 to positioning roll in dim conditions<br/>+2 to positioning roll in dark conditions <br/><b><br/>Origin / Allegiance</b><br/>Next we choose the primary source of the character's hardware, toys and mojo.

Therefor the ability to roll moderately high numbers consistantly, is going to give you better results over time than high numbers occassionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can also be a challenge to manage narrow range bands.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were doing a sniper rifle and wanted to mimic the deadiness of say ...God in Navy Seals...I'd stick with the limited 6 range band, but I'd give more on the +side.  2d8+2 would be much scarier than 1d10 at a range band of 6, but at a range band of 5 it would be only just as good as your assault rifle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also cut the range of your asault rifles down to 4-5.  6 should be the range band where only the sniper plays effectively.  Either that, or add several more range steps to the strip, but I think that would probably just be slower and less fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso rifle...not feeling it.  The difference between a "rifle" and an "assault rifle" is that a rifle is civilian and an assault rifle is military.  The gap between those in effectiveness has been steadily increasing.  Back in the day, the civilian long arm was often superior to the military grade variety (see Pennsylvania Rifle vs. Brown Bess).  During the Civil War they were much more comparable (largely because of the large number of military arms that wound up in private hands).  But since then military grade has been leaving civilian grade in the dust.  At least civilian grade in the sense of the guns you can buy at WalMart.  The specialized Ueber hunting guns and sport competition shooting guns are comparable to (and often better than) military grade sniping rifles.  Point being, that postulating a CyberPunk future where arms tech continues to spiral, the difference between a state of the art kill-you-dead assault rifle, and civilian piece straight off the gun rack should be even greater than it is today...so I would either nerf the rifle significantly or just eliminate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMachine Pistol...yeah, 1 handed instead of 2...but I'd probably do something like 3d6-1.  They're fun and all, but there's a reason no one serious really uses them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an alternate damage idea.  Make all of your automatic fire weapons multi dice.  In fact for weapons where you can select you could do single shot as 1d8+1,  3 round bursts as 2d8 and a full auto as 4d8-1.  Going to 6 or 8 dice (-2) for machine guns and other rapid fire large magazine type pull and spray weapons.  Then do the Sorcerer Trick.

The advantage of the assault rifle is rate of fire and larger clip size (made possible by smaller rounds). <br><br>I would suggest giving the assault rifle a shorter range and more variable damage (2d6 for example) while giving the sniper rifle longer range but higher minimum and maximum damage (like 1d10+5 or something).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235318/#Comment_235318" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T19:16:45+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  7:16PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jarvis: Remember that this isn't the damage rolls we are looking at, but the attack dice.

And cyberpunk is definitely about cool over real functionality, so I would rather make them useful to promote coolness in play. And while I like the idea of allowing multiple dice to hit in combat, I don't want to hack the combat system heavily since I won't have that much time to playtest this and want to try to stay close to the mechanics of the original game.<br><br>Jarvis:<br><br>The automatic fire is what I use to allow single dice versus multiple dice in a weapon. <br><br>Except for the brutal point-blank weapons (stubby shotguns and flamers) which get treated as automatic weapons (2 dice), semi-auto weapons get 1 die and automatic weapons get 2 dice.<br><br/>What we are trying to replace are the following weapons:<br/><br/>Bow (1d8+1, range 5-6)<br/>Javelin (1d6+1, range 2-4)<br/>Spear (1d8, 1d6, range 2)<br/>Sword (2d6, range 1)<br/><br/>Now, standard Agon also has the shield (1d8 defense only), but that doesn't suit the feel of Agon Ex Machina, which is why I'm giving the auto weapons the 2 dice so you have a means of getting defense dice. Also note that all weapons can be used up to 2 range bands outside their optimal range but at a penalty of -2 per range band outside of optimal (so in this case a bow can actually be used at ranges of 3 to 8).<br/><br/>Where I stand currently:<br/><br/>Long Range Support Weapons | 1d10+2 | Range: 6 | 2 hands<br/>Rifle | 1d8+1 | Range: 5 | 2 hands<br/>Assault Rifle | 2d8 | Range 4-5 | 2 hands<br/>Submachine Gun | 2d6 | Range 2-4 | 2 hands<br/>Machine Pistol | 2d6 | Range 2 | 1 hand<br/>Handcannon | 1d8 | Range 2 | 1 hand<br/>Stubby Shotgun or Flamethrower | 2d6 | Range 1 | 2 hands<br/><br/>Is this starting to feel better?<br/><br/>Or should I simplify it further and go back to the original weapons with different names (and just forget about trying to balance it for the missing shield)?<br/><br/>Rifle (1d8+1, range 5-6)<br/>Submachine Gun (1d6+1, range 2-4)<br/>Machine Pistol (1d8, 1d6, range 2)<br/>Point Blank Weapon System (2d6, range 1)
