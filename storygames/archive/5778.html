Tell me what price you pay for the superpower. This could be a direct "when I use X, I suffer Y", or it could be something less direct and more a "character balance" thing.<br/><br/><br/>Example:<br/><i>1. My name is Jason Morningstar, and any time anyone mentions an American President that predates 1905, it triggers my psycho-psion neuro-attuners to psychically send me an email describing the conversation about the President in question, and also verifies the validity of those claims made.

My superpower is <b>instantaneous magical matter conversion</b>.  I can instantly transform anything into anything else -- anything I can imagine, and the power fills in the details I'm fuzzy on. That way I can turn a daisy into a fully loaded submachine gun, even though I don't know how the innards of a smg work.  Also, the power would do transformations of a more subtle nature, like turning an assmunch into someone I can deal with. And create things that defy the laws of physics, like scrying mirrors and magical robes that create force fields around me.  And it would work from a distance.  A great distance.  Basically I'd be a genie who can grant his own wishes.  Eat that "Invisibility."<br/><br/>The first thing I do with this power is replace my own body with an ageless, indestructible duplicate, something that can survive a direct hit from a multiple megaton nuke.  A <i>better looking</i> ageless, indestructible duplicate.  With a snazzy costume.  I'm thinking something in black and green, with an oriental flair or pulp era flair.  Since supervillainy and overthrowing governments, crippling economies, and savaging people's silly little military toys appeals to me more than rescuing kittens from trees, I'm thinking I'd go with a Cobra Commanderesque hood and military uniform sort of deal, and a hood and robe combo for more relaxed, kickin' it in the lair moments.  I'd personally lay a whupping on all the world's major militaries, knock over some fancy monuments, and set myself up as Emperor of the World.  I'd whip myself up some minions, doing stuff like turning pebbles into ninjas and cars into giant foo dragons.  I'd turn the President into a poodle and put a leash on him.  Pretty much anyone who wanted to remain in power would have to kiss my feet and smile about it.  The people not seeking out power, which is the vast  majority of everyone, would suddenly find their governments and business leaders working to earn their respect and actually do their damn jobs.<br/><br/>2. Ruling the world is lonely, boring work.  Also, at some point, you stop wearing the mask, and the mask starts wearing you.  Also, it seems almost inevitable that some young do-gooder will either find the source of my power and gain it for himself or take it away from me, and I'll come crashing up against my own hubris.   But it'll all be worth, jut for the part where I get to engage with jet fighters in hand to hand combat while flying, and hurl tanks around.  And turn world leaders into small yapping dogs.

I use this power mostly to make my life easier in various ways, and also to do spontaneous RPGs with myself ("Am I up for Polaris tonight? I think I am!" POP! POP! POP!) I don't think any of my duplicates would be more prone to costumed vigilantism than I am, so, yeah, no crime fighting. Or crime sprees, either. I'm just not that kind of person.<br/><br/>Edit: In addition to RPGs, I just realized I could sing duets much better. AWESOME. (Having to sing both parts of a duet when I get one stuck in my head always makes me feel a tiny bit awkward.)<br/><br/>Cost: Although my many selves can merge and share the memories/etc of their separate experiences, my duplicates don't have any mental telepathy with each other. While they're got the same personality and goals, that may not necessarily result in flawless cooperation. ("No, you give <i>me</i> a backrub!")<br/><br/>Plus, when I remerge, the metabolic costs of my activities get compounded. So, for example, if I spent two hours as five people, and none of them ate during that period, it would be like going ten hours without food, after reincorporation. If I spent eight hours awake as three people (who presumably each ate something), and remerged, it would suddenly be like going a full 24 hours without sleep. ("I'm taking a nap - <i>for all of us.</i>" "No, <i>I'm</i> taking a nap for all of us!" "I'm drinking a beer for all of us." "Ooooh, good idea.")<br/><br/>Wait. Is it too late to take immortality?

It would be impossible to trust anyone.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129910/#Comment_129910" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T03:59:39+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  3:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2008 4:00AM by Jarrod.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, I've written so many comic book ideas... if only I had the ability to draw.

Hi, my name is Lars Lindhardt, and I have the ability to send my mind back in time, effectively reoccupying my own body in the past. My power makes me nigh invulnerable, since if I am ever close to dying, I can simply jump back. Also I am good at almost everything, since I have practically all the time I need for practicing: I can play the piano and I always get my woman (even if I have to try several times...)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Having infinite time at my disposal, but being trapped within the timeframe of 1987-2063, has made me even more eager (to the point of craziness) than normal people to know the world before and after me, since eventually you will know you own time too well. <br/>\nWhich leads to the second price: after having lived for thousands upon thousands of years, I have tried everything I can possibly imagine, except one thing: dying. Everyday is a constant struggle not to kill myself, merely for the sake of trying something new.<br/>\nAnd last, but not least: I am very, very lonely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129933/#Comment_129933" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T09:26:49+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  9:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. My name is Ben Johnson and I can cause anyone to change genders by simply willing it so. They must sleep for at least 4 hours, but upon waking, they will arise, Orlando-like, somewhat differently than they went down.<br/><br/>2. The power takes over my life. The number of requests forces me to turn it into a business just to manage the number of applications for The Sleep. After a costly lawsuit, I am forced to initiate a practice of lengthy interviews prior to gender reassignment, and for a while this forces me to spend even longer working, and raise my prices significantly. After a few years, I am finally able to train a bank of interviewers to take over that task for me, and this, along with the introduction of a carefully worded legal waiver, gives me some of my life back and allows me to lower my prices from Astronomical back to Significant. Being tabloid-infamous makes it difficult to maintain a "real" relationship, but the money helps. Every day I fantasize about going into seclusion, but then guilt beats me back into my work. I become a father, then a mother. Neither child has my gift, and I start to worry about what will happen when I die, or, God, if I go senile. I put more money into my gender research institute in an attempt to find a more conventional means of replicating my ability. I draw up an elaborate contingency plan to be executed in the event that I lose my mental clarity. At last, when I am 72, a breakthrough! The Sleep becomes available via a course of prescription pills. Exhausted, I retire. Within ten years, the pills will be available over-the-counter in a majority of countries. Shortly after my 80th birthday, a nurse gives me an injection, but I hardly notice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129998/#Comment_129998" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-24T14:12:26+00:00" title="February 24, 2008  2:12PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben,<br/><br/>Most bizarre.

My name is Simon Carryer, and I'm the Elephant Man.  Unfortunate name, but it's appropriate, because not only am I horribly ugly, I never forget.  I have a perfect photographic memory.  If I glanced at a page of newspaper ten years ago, I can tell you every word it said, as if I was looking at it now.  I can flip through a dictionary, read a grammar, and then speak a language fluently.  I can remember details I didn't notice at the time, like subtle changes in expression, which give away people's true motives.  A reclusive genius, I mostly use my powers reluctantly to help the other heroes who come asking.  I can tell them the secret identity of Doctor Nemisis, because I remember the winner of the 1985 science fair in Dakota was Eddie Norman, and his project was a life support system for his dying mouse.  <br/><br/>2. The price is that I can't remember anything about my life prior to the car crash that killed my family, and left me horribly scarred.  Before the crash, I was an ordinary man.  I've read everything ever written about the man I was, looked at every photograph, watched every home movie.  I can tell you every detail that was ever recorded.  But nothing comes close to actually remembering.  Worse, I feel the loss as acutely as if it were yesterday.  I never forget.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130560/#Comment_130560" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T11:29:12+00:00" title="February 26, 2008 11:29AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

I am completely invulnerable. I use this power to become a star of television and movies. One of my greatest stunts is being dropped into the Grand Canyon from a helicopter.<br/><br/>I receive extreme pressure from the government to be involved in military training and deployment. I refuse, publically citing pacifism. Peace lovers and war objectors love me, hawks call me a coward and despise me for all the good I could but refuse to do for my country. Oddly enough, my power brings me fame and infamy not for my ability to live fearless of death, but for the controversy over what exactly I should be doing with it.<br/><br/>Stressed out, I seek out more and more extreme tests of my power. I participate in dangerous sports, getting tackled by some of the heaviest linebackers in the NFL. I'm a guest star on nature shows where the most popular footage of my powers - wrestling with a grizzly bear and laughing while it mauled me - originated. But eventually, eventually, I become totally numb. An overload of adrenaline combined with a complete lack of fear make me emotionally deadened. Finally, in an act of ennui, I agree to be launched into the atmosphere in a space shuttle designed to break up when it reaches an extreme height. In an accident that many individuals accuse the government of doing on purpose, the shuttle breaks up over the Atlantic Ocean. I plummet flaming into the water and am never seen again. I'm presumed drowned and dead, or perhaps I sank to the bottom, entangled with a heavy metal piece of the spaceship and I'm pinned and trapped, going completely insane. Or maybe in the darkness and the cold, I just rest and listen to the sound of the water.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130601/#Comment_130601" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T13:34:46+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  1:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret Gillian, take one Utterly Heartbreaking point.

My name is John Harper, and I can create worlds. I write them down in notebooks, with little drawings, margin notes, descriptions of people and places, pasted-in swatches of fabric, reference photos, whatever. I put a notebook under my pillow, and then, when I sleep, I live in this other world. It seems completely real to me -- a perfect immersive reality. Time is flexible. A night spent in another world might seem like several weeks there. Eventually, I discover that I can take other people with me, if they're sleeping next to me when I cross over. I have lots of fun visiting worlds with my friends after that.<br/><br/>2. I sleep for twelve straight hours one night. Then, twenty. I become obsessed with my final notebook, a huge thing covered in dense writing and images. I tell everyone it has to be perfect. I stop leaving my house. All I do is work on the notebook and sleep for longer and longer periods. I want to take my lover across with me, to show her my ultimate creation and explore it all with her, but by then I am too strange and disconnected to convince her. One day, I just don't wake up at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130731/#Comment_130731" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T22:42:07+00:00" title="February 26, 2008 10:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Holy fuck.

I use my now unlimited amount of free time to draw comics, write games, read and play that giant stack of PS2 games that are sitting in the living room. I astound my employers by turning in assignments seconds after they've been assigned! I astound my readership by posting a dozen new pages of my webcomic every day!

I have a secret base called "the Superiority Complex". Why? Just because?<br/><br/>The downside? No matter how much free time I have, I'll always find ways to waste it. Why get work done on my comic when I can spend countless hours playing Playstation and reading manga? Why work on a new illustration if I can spend a timeless afternoon carrying stacks of 20 dollar bills out of a bank vault? Why work on my new game if I can spend all day looking up the skirts of random inanimate women on the bus (Yes, I know that's awful. I'm sorry. I'm sooooo sorry).

The powers have to be pretty specific, so if you want to be immortal and be super strong, you can forget it. People used to ask for super strength a lot. Then they found out about "super beauty." All those heroes? All those villains? I created them all. Don't blame me for the choices they made. I don't charge money or anything, but many people feel like they owe me a favor. The League Of Heroes folks are always looking out for me - they bought me this nice house. But all kinds of people keep trying to kill me to "stop the problem at the source."

My name is Steven Grady, and with a single glance I can assess the mass of any object, accurate to within a microgram.  It's not useful enough to warrant a costume (with minor power comes minimal responsibility), but I'm pretty good at throwing things accurately, and I've found gainful employment at moving companies. I think I'd make a good customs agent, but eyeing people's luggage seems kind of boring.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.
