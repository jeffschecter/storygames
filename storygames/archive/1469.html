                    Many of the games we talk about here (and RPGs overall) just don't work well at all when you play them via voice chat.  Too many fiddly bits, too much reliance on table visuals, etc.  (To be clear, I don't think these are faults -- just properties.  In a lot of cases, essential properties of their games.)<br/><br/>Many more games <i>almost</i> work well online, but you need someone to do a fair bit of extra work, or you need to create some special tracking tools to handle things.<br/><br/>But what games can be played via Skype almost right out of the box, with (1) almost no extra work required, and (2) almost no loss of game-generated player information?<br/><br/>Here's a list of games that I don't think meet the standard I'm imagining, just to be clear:
<ul>
<li> Dogs in the Vineyard.  Too much effort to manage dice pools.  I want to be able to look across the table and see who's got what.  It's probably easier to play Dogs via IRC/MUSH than voice chat.<br/></li><li> PTA.  Hmm.  Borderline.  One person can roll all the cards without too much extra work.  Tracking chips movements makes me squint and wonder.  [EDIT: <i>I'm starting to think this would work fairly well, actually, with just a little cost of announcing how much is left in the Producer and Fan Mail pools, or whatever.</i>]<br/></li><li> Primitive.  It seems like playing online slaughters the language fun.  You really want to be in person to make this work.<br/></li><li> Agon.  Without some kind of online tool thing, I can't imagine playing this cool game.<br/></li></ul>
Of games that I suspect would work, there's Polaris.  Just start by having everyone spend 30 seconds up-front to draw a table diagram to communicate who's where, and you should be good to go from there, yeah?<br/><br/>What else?<br/><br/>-JasonN                </div>

                            A game that works with voice alone, without any physical artifacts, would be awesome. Just thought I'd mention that to anyone who is working on such a project.

                            Well, Amber, Theatrix, and Everway, obviously.  <br/><br/>Most other games have at least some issues with rolling and bookkeeping, but as long as you assign particular people to track particular things it should be workable.  In general, you want to minimize these, however.  So the ideal is a game where there isn't looking at other people's resources and die rolls, and die rolls are relatively infrequent.  For example, My Life With Master would be fine, or various versions of Fudge (especially with Subjective Combat).                        </div>

                            Nine Worlds worked great over Skype. Everyone had his own deck of cards, and simply reported his values in conflicts. We added use of a Wiki to keep track of characters, Muses and other scores, but it wasn't necessary to do so.                        </div>

                            Heh. I remember playing Robotech and Heavy Gear over the phone in high-school, before we all got cars. I don't think that playing over Skype, Google Talk or any other VOIP would be any different. I paid special attention making my descriptions as clear as possible, trusted my group not to fudge their rolls, and we managed to take turns talking, so everything worked out fine. But then again those are all good practices for regular gaming as well! <br/><br/>I imagine that I could pull off the same with Dogs, Polaris, TSoY, or any of the other indie games I'm dying to play these days. If my group had the time in their busy schedules. *grumble*                        </div>

<p>Does it have to be Skype alone? At an old workplace of mine, people would take their laptops to meetings, for ease of sharing urls and what not, and out-of-band stuff happened at the keyboard. I seem to recall a study's showing this actually increases productivity. I see no reason not to use Skype (for its great human bandwidth), IRC (dice-rolling, chat that would otherwise be distracting), and a wiki together. For that matter, Skype has chat built in anyway.</p>

I agree with this.  Amber obviously (though my personal ten-year-growth bias shows here - in that I think it works as a system by virtue of not really having one). From there, my mind immediately jumped to Mortal Coil -- wiki'd character sheets would be handy, simply to track changes to Pools and such.  The resolution might be a bit weird -- there's no dice to roll, so that = good for straight chat, but it seems like there would need to be some place to handle the moment of "reveal" in conflicts, so that it's properly 'hidden' from everyone involved until the right time.<br/><br/>Hmm.  If I had the right group for it, I'd still use wiki, and just have everyone use a "token allocation" page linked off their main character sheet -- edit it with your allocations, then save it for the reveal and then everyone refreshes their view to see how it shook out.<br/><br/>You could even make a 'main reveal' page that auto-included everyone's individual bids.
<blockquote>Me:<br/>Force + Drinking + 1 Action token = 6<br/>Will + Dancing + 2 Action tokens: 8</blockquote>
<blockquote>Brennan:<br/>Will + Singing + 3 Action token = 8<br/>Grace + Darts + 2 Action tokens: 5</blockquote>
Or something.  That unfortunately gets away from "skype-only". Hmm.  If Skype has text chat built in, you could message a neutral third part with your bids, I suppose.<br/><br/>Others...<br/>Best Friends?  Pretty sure that would work.                        </div>

                            Well, to roll back to the original post, I think it sounds like he wants to use Skype for long distance gaming.<br/><br/>And Wikis and stuff are fine, and will probably adapt to playing almost ANY game online (people can roll dice or play cards and say the results), but it sounds like we're looking for a game that is in that "top 10%" category of "I read the book, I can play long distance over Skype with no setting up tools, recording or passing out sheets, etc".  <br/><br/>AMBER Totally fits this bill. I'm wondering if, once the "Game Contest Fury" has died down a few months to give everyone a breather, if it wouldn't behoove us to try to specifically put together a game that was absolutely geared towards long-distance play over skype, with minimal setup and the like. What would the elements of such a game be, I wonder?<br/><br/>Perhaps all pregen characters, and all the people with the rules just say who they want to be.<br/><br/>If there are stats and stuff, they would probably be shortlisted (ala AMBER) so that the GM could write them down in about 1-2 minutes and get right into it.<br/><br/>Distribution: Perhaps a game where the majority of "X" comes in a book/PDF for purchase, but "Materials for players to use" would all be a free download and the like.<br/><br/>Hmmm, worth discussing IMO. I have more local gaming than I can stand now, honestly (THREE local gaming groups, 2 weekly and one bi-weekly). BUT, having said that, I still have the itch to throw down with John or Matt(s) or Keith or whomever halfway across the country or planet, and having a game rigged to do that, or rigging a <b>KIT</b> to add to an Existing Game would be, IMO, Awesome. Like, "Double -Throw the Horns Up- Awesome".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Actually, for Mortal Coil I specifically was thinking that this WOULDN'T be a good game for Skype (probably even "the worst game for skype", other than a game that relied on constant task dice rolls), because the game is so awesome in its visualizations. You got your coins, you have the places to move them on the character sheet, you have your "reveal", etc. It wouldn't be the same. In fact, if I may, it would be like a male having sex with an unlubed Fleshlight tied to the bars of a steel cage while wearing two condoms and polka music playing in the background.<br/><br/>If there were a free online Mortal Coil visualization Tool (like the online BtI game), then that would totally work. But without it.... bleah.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Well, to roll back to the original post, I think it sounds like he wants to use Skype for long distance gaming.<br/><br/>[snip] we're looking for a game that is in that "top 10%" category of "I read the book, I can play long distance over Skype with no setting up tools, recording or passing out sheets, etc".</blockquote>
Okay, brainstorming.<br/><br/>1. A short 'set' list of Attributes/Traits character qualities with, optionally, some tweaking/customizing/additional traits to be added.  Amber, MC, Nobilis, Best Friends*... hell, there's lots of pretty good examples here, but basically a list you could remember pretty easily.<br/><br/>2. Resolution system that doesn't require simultaneous opposed checks, or handles it in some genius way I haven't thought of.  (IMO -- I went on a bit in my last post, talking about Mortal Coil, as to why I think that would be a problem -- same's true for Die rolls, card pulls, etc.)<br/><br/><b>Edit, to incorporate Andy's point:</b>3. Doesn't have a really kick ass tactile component (see: Mortal Coil, Agon) that is lost by switching to Skype.  (Aside: I want that online token-moving tool that he's talking about -- that would rock.)<br/><br/>More?<br/><br/>((Unrelated side note: Best Friends would rock for playing Amber. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> ))                        </div>

<blockquote><br/>Actually, for Mortal Coil I specifically was thinking that this WOULDN'T be a good game for Skype (probably even "the worst game for skype", other than a game that relied on constant task dice rolls), because the game is so awesome in its visualizations. You got your coins, you have the places to move them on the character sheet, you have your "reveal", etc. It wouldn't be the same. In fact, if I may, it would be like a male having sex with an unlubed Fleshlight tied to the bars of a steel cage while wearing two condoms and polka music playing in the background.</blockquote>
And... as my experience playing Mortal Coil isn't 'real' for about to more weeks... and my experience with your other example... does not immediately invite comparison to an RPG... I'll entirely bow to your experience in this.<br/><br/>Also, the whole thing just makes me want to get my MC game started sooner. :P                        </div>

                            I've run something that's essentially GURPS over Skype with, as far as I can tell, no loss of traction. In one case everyone just rolled their own dice. In another case, we did have an IRC chat-channel.<br/><br/>That said, I think that playing online with Skype gives some really interesting ways to *improve* the basic gaming experience (sound-effects, for example)--but the basic traditional game format, when it didn't require a battle map, seemed to work seamlessly for me.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

                            Over the Edge seems like a good fit, though it doesn't fit Doyce's #2. I wonder, though, what is the reason :simultaneous opposed rolls" are a problem? Is it an honesty factor without the dice rolling in front of everyone or electronically? Is it handling time? I understand you wouldn't want a game with lots of little rolls or anything, but OtE, especially if you lean it more towards a "say yes or roll the dice" approach, and only roll when it's important, would have pretty low handling time compared to a traditional system.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, Andy. . .my god. On reading your. . .VIVID analogy, my mouth hung open for like five minutes. And I don't even know what a "fleshlight" is (I'd Google it but I'm at work), though I can guess. That's horrible. That's revolting. That's appalling. Now I must share it with others.<br/>

                            I'm going to append to this thread:  The Mountain Witch.  The slick and simple resolution system, while not meeting my 'no opposed rolls' rule is dead simple in an online format, and everything else works.  I'm running a game in Play by Forum (which is typically a slow-as-death format that I really dislike) and the speed of both resolution and the framing of the game really counters the weaknesses of the interface -- I can only imagine that it would work even better with live voice chat.  Using a dice server (many available online) will even allow for basically simultaneous rolling.                        </div>

                            Most of my recent role playing has been done over Skype. My old RPG'ing friends are geographically dispersed and when I discovered the indie rpg scene it was a natural choice. We also use a lightweight aid called <a href="http://gametable.galactanet.com/" rel="nofollow">Gametable</a> which provides communal dice rolling and a shared "tabletop". <br/><br/>Games tried so far:<br/><br/>Dogs: Worked well but gametable was essential. It allowed us to push dice images around to during conflicts.<br/>Inspectres: Works well. Apart from dice rolling gametable is only used to contain the franchise sheet and and its dice plus the running franchise dice total. Neither of these are critical and  dice rolling could be done privately.<br/>Breaking The Ice: Graham's online version wasn't available and the game still worked well. We used gametable for dice rolling but really didn't need to.<br/><br/>Shooting The Moon: Another one that works well with no reliance on a shared space.<br/><br/>I will shortly be running Lacuna which I can see no problems with and hopefully next year Burning Empires. For BE I will require gametable's shared space or something like <a href="http://www.thinkature.com/" rel="nofollow">Thinkature</a> for Firefights.<br/><br/>Games that I don't think I'll be trying even though I really want to<br/><br/>Mortal Coil is unfortunately one game I won't be trying. I think conflicts have too many tokens and stuff moving about.<br/>Dust Devils. You would have thought that a simple card handling/sharing program would exist but if it does I can't find it. Its a shame. Graham?<br/><br/>I'd like to play Mountain Witch and think it would work. The only question is how to distribute the secrets so that no one (including the GM) knows who has what.                        </div>
