However the basic idea is as follows: <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a small deck of cards, each of which has a fairy tale ending on it (for example "and then he forgave them and they were married."). Each player is dealt one of these cards, and the rest of this deck plays no further part in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a larger deck of cards, each of which contains a *plot element* from fairy tales (for example 'a trap', 'betrayal', 'this animal can talk'). Everyone has a hand of these cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne player at a time is a narrator, and tells a story, discarding a card whenever they mention an element that matches one of their cards. They're aiming to get rid of all their cards, then end the story with their ending card.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople can take over the story in various circumstances, usually when they have a card that matches something in the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, playing it, it struck me that it seems like with a bit of tweaking it could make a pretty good RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne obvious change would be to make the elements more fantasy-RPG like, adding things like dragons and hobbits and removing a few things (most of the elements could stay actually).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I'm not sure how to deal with the differences between the game as it is, and how RPGs are usually played.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, in the game one player at a time controls the entire 'world' of the story, and the main conflict is between players trying to acheive this control - whereas in an RPG usually each player controls their character, with the exception of the GM who controls everything else, and conflicts are usually supposed to be between the *characters* and the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, and related to that, the GM usually has the final say when a conflict occurs, and the result, although with very strong guidelines (mostly in the form of rules) and random chance (again guided strongly by the rules) - whereas in the game whoever's controlling the story at the time decides on conflicts, with no input from other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I have a GM?<br/>\nShould players have their own character/s? If so, what would controlling the story mean? Would it mean being the GM? If so, what happens to the player's character?<br/>\nWhat would be the most appropriate way to resolve conflicts?<br/>\nHow would the 'endings' work? Should they be understood to be motivations of the characters, or (as they are in the game) aims for the players that aren't related to the characters in the story?<br/>\nShould the story entirely come from the cards (as in the game), or should there be expected to be a pre-prepared 'adventure', with the cards acting as a randomising device? If a pre-prepared adventure, who prepares it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax" title="BastardToadflax"><img alt="BastardToadflax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax">BastardToadflax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91284/#Comment_91284" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T07:34:00+00:00" title="August 29, 2007  7:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had great success getting non-gamers to play and enjoy this game.  However, that initial enthusiasm has never  seemed to push those non gamers over the edge (to use another Atlas title) into what one might consider full fledged rpgs.   Perhaps you can fashion a sort of ultimate gateway drug from this game. Sorry, I know that doesn't actually address anything you asked...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Age%20of%20Fable" title="Age of Fable"><img alt="Age of Fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Age%20of%20Fable">Age of Fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92076/#Comment_92076" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T07:52:46+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the reply. Here's a slightly more solid model, for further criticism and feedback:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's no GM, but players will take turns having the GM role.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers aren't expected to come up with an adventure before playing, as a GM would usually do - rather, they're expected to respond to the cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player generates a character before playing, as is normal for RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a rule system, and a system for using the cards. The two are independent, so the rules can be used for a more normal RPG, and the cards can be combined with another game system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two decks: a 'beginnings' deck, and an 'elements' deck. Both decks are shuffled. The top card of both decks are turned over. The 'beginning' card reveals how the adventure starts (eg 'the characters have been hired to escort a diplomat through dangerous ruins'). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe 'elements' deck plays an ongoing role in the game, whereas the 'beginnings' deck isn't used after the adventure has started.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM role is initially assigned randomly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM role always passes to the left (eg).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM describes what happens as normal, but must work in whatever's showing on the 'element' card [BIG QUESTION: how to ensure that they do this? what penalties for not doing it? Should the element be secret, only revealed when the GM integrates it into the story?]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM still controls their character. However, the GM's character can't make saves. If the GM's character wants to make a save, they have to pass the GM role to their left [BIG QUESTION: how else does it get passed? is there a limit? How to stop the GM having a conversation with themselves? Time limits? One encounter/scene per GM?]<br/>\n<br/>\nother questions: could the cards be random tables instead, which would be cheaper? Or at least the beginnings?<br/>\n<br/>\nwhat kind of elements? broad, general ones or specific, evocative ones ( as eg my 'adventure ideas generator' - http://www.apolitical.info/webgame/ideas.php - which is itself largely compiled from other sources)<br/>\n<br/>\nother ideas - elements may appear as obstacles, goals or aids (a la the 'Adventure Funnel' method of RPG creation) - randomly? GMs choice? One of each kind of element present at a time? Maybe one of each per encounter/scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
