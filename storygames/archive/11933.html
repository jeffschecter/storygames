One of our regulars didn\u2019t show, but we had three players and me, enough to do character and village creation so we\u2019ll be ready to start playing right away next session. We decided on a three-session game, each of the three players made hero characters and we did the group village web.<br/><br/>Our village is called River Canyon Village and it is far to the north, at the edge of the People\u2019s lands, among the deep canyons above the Longest River. It is perched in a side canyon, up in a cave mouth halfway up the cliff.<br/><br/>The first character is He-Speaks-the-Wind, born to the Porcupine clan and a member of the Talking Society, so a bit of a mystic. He is strong in Faith and Strength but weak in Spirit and Skill. He is handsome and a clever wordsmith, but he tends to overlook the obvious.<br/><br/>Next, we have She-Gathers-Wool, of the Black Stone clan and a member of the Long Walking Society. She is formidable. She is strong in Strength and Skill, but weak in Faith and Spirit. She is pretty and self-reliant, but has a grim and dour demeanor.<br/><br/>The final character is He-Runs-with-Herds, from the Bighorn clan and a member of the Arrow Society, a mighty hunter. He is strong in Skill and Spirit, but weak in Strength and Faith. He is knowledgeable about beasts and has heard the call of the wild, but he cares nothing for social norms.<br/><br/>From here, we built out the village web.<br/><br/>He-Runs-with-Herds, is in love with She-Fights-Like-a-Man. His father, He-Has-Seen-All, is the Outside Chief and elder of the Arrow Society, but the son and father have no respect for one another. He wishes to marry She-Fights-Like-a-Man, as well as to help her join the Dog Society and become a warrior (a crime). Also, He-Runs-with-Herds wishes to drive out the Night People who live within the cave and threaten the village.<br/><br/>He-Speaks-the-Wind, hates He-Studies-the-Clouds, an older medicine man. He-Studies-the-Clouds returns the sentiment. A woman called They-All-Want-Her is in love with He-Speaks-the-Wind, but he does not love her (yet?). He also wants to learn the secrets that are told by He-Whispers-Secrets, a sorcerer who lives atop the mesa (a crime). He wants to prove himself greater than He-Studies-the-Clouds, and to help He-Runs-with-Herds and She-Fights-Like-a-Man to get married.<br/><br/>She-Gathers-Wool is friends with another woman in the village, She-Fights-Like-a-Man, who aspires to become a warrior. She-Gathers-Wool is hated by He-Longs-for-Touch because she has spurned his advances. She wishes to eliminate the monster called She-Bathes-in-Blood as a threat to the village. She also wants to heal the rift between He-Runs-with-Herds and his father. She wants to have many lovers but never marry (a crime).\ufeff<br/><br/>Everybody was really charged up and excited with our setup and can\u2019t wait to get started. As intended, the village is charged with tension and there are a lot of obstacles lying in the way of our heroes\u2019 ambitions. I\u2019ll report back after the first session!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
