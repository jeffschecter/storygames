I'm not into 'traditional RPGs' as much as I'm into the types of games that most of us here at Story-games tend to be into. I'm also looking for games that arn't too 'crunchy'. It would be great if I could get a GMed game and GMless game suggestion for each setting/play style. If you could suggest games that you have played before, I would really appreciate it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I had the FFG Star Wars games but have gotten rid of them because they seemed too crunchy and traditional for me. What game do you think would work well for playing a Star Wars session/short-campaign?<br/><br/>I own The One Ring RPG and have heard it works well for playing in Middle-Earth. From what I've heard it is fairly traditional. I'm not sure how crunchy it is however. I have also heard that is a pretty good game though. If there is a game that would work well and fit my tastes a bit more, I would likely get rid of it. What game would you suggest? Do you think The One Ring would be best, for a Lord of the Rings style session/short-campaign, or something else?<br/><br/>I also have the ASOIAF RPG by Green Ronin. This game seems quite crunchy and traditional. I've also heard it isn't the best game. I don't know if I want to put all the effort into learning such a crunchy, traditional-style game. If there is a game that would fit my tastes more, and work well for this style of play, I would likely get rid of it. Anyway, what game do you think would be best for an ASOIAF session/short campaign?<br/><br/>I would really appreciate any suggestions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>TLDR: What low-crunch, Indie-ish games (either GM or GMless) would work well for playing a Star Wars style game, and what low-crunch, Indie-ish games would work well for playing an ASOIAF style game?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459130/#Comment_459130" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T07:25:25+00:00" title="January 10, 2017  7:25AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can only comment about Middle-Earth.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T%27s">@Paul_T's</a> game about Eowyn would probably be exactly what you are looking for.

Specifically, you could easily play a drama game (as in, important protagonists making tough choices) set in any of those settings with one of the generic vehicles - anything like Primetime Adventures, Dust Devils, Solar System, Heroquest, even Fate (which we discussed at length last week) will easily adapt to all three of those settings and provide its own take on what it's like to be a jedi/hobbit/prince in those worlds when the Story comes barreling at you.<br/><br/>I will particularly recommend <i>Tales of Entropy</i> (an upcoming story game, I think we discussed it at some point a bit) for your purposes here for a couple of reasons: it matches the campaign length you suggest very well; it is specifically designed to front-load a firm literary basis, while still making the actual gameplay all about the players and their ideas; it is easy to set up for each of those three settings, and the players will enjoy using the same system for three contrasting settings, while still having plenty of unique freedom to make each scenario an unique experience. If your plan is to play in all of those settings as a sort of a fantasy story game trilogy, then Entropy is probably one of the top picks for pushing the project to a successful completion. As a bonus, it is entirely feasible to "play the novel" with Entropy (as in, you play Frodo, I play Gandalf, and here's the One Ring, let's play to see what happens), if that strikes your fancy, instead of setting up a secondary story in the same setting.<br/><br/>It is, of course, possible to get more ambitious and detailed about the substance of each of those stories, and then there is the question of player interfacing - what will, exactly, be the role of the playgroup in adding to the corpus when there already exists a perfectly serviceable novel/movie? What is it that we want to do <i>with</i> the far-away galaxy, Middle-Earth and Westeros?<br/><br/>Assuming it was me planning to play these, and I wanted to get ambitious, while still sticking to a short campaign, here's my personalized picks for each of those stories:<br/><br/><b>Star Wars:</b> <i>Star Wars</i> is an ensemble adventure movie, so I would choose a party-based game. The story in the campaign needs to go big, epic and iconic, to match the feel of the movie. The setting is a conceptually rich space opera, so a game that can handle that conceptually (ship battles, statting up droids, aliens, whatever) is a must. Thematically there is leeway: it needs to be romantic (in the literary sense), but aside from that there is room to do stuff and still have a basis in the SW feel. Considering these factors, my choice would be <i>Heroquest</i> - the latest edition in particular is a perfectly streamlined princess play Sim adventure story game, and it's much more realistic to adapt it to a highly specific setting than Fate would be just for the giggles.<br/><br/><b>The Lord of the Rings:</b> This is a morality play; I know that many focus on the Fellowship of the Ring, but that's not really what the story is about. Instead, you'll want a high-power drama game that allows for high contrasts in scale of action (because providence <i>will</i> make even the smaller things matter, and has meaningful rules for the internal life of the characters. Concepts such as moral absolutes and corruption are central. Characters are defined in terms of their social position more than their skill-sets. If you weren't crunch-averse I would recommend <i>Burning Wheel</i>, but that being the case, a slight hack of <i>Hero's Banner</i> is what surfaces for me: it'll be to the point, and the epic breadth of campaign play will actually help the setting breathe in a novel way that doesn't conflict with its basic feel.<br/><br/><b>A Song of Ice and Fire:</b> Personally, I would probably go for a harsh challenge-game with power struggle, secrets and betrayal, but that'd quickly go beyond "story game", so let's stick to that. We want something with a grey moral world, huge ensemble cast, no unitary plot, but basically a blood opera with characters in harsh opposition to each other's interests, often in tragic manner. The obvious choice is <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, no question: in a campaign context it captures the necessary breadth of storytelling easily, having no difficulty with swapping protagonists in and out, jumping forward in time and so on.<br/><br/>So yeah: Heroquest, Hero's Banner and In a Wicked Age, apparently.\n<blockquote>I actually have a corollary question for anyone reading this thread.

There's a lot of tricky bookkeeping just for tracking experience, and the combat rules (both physical and social/verbal) are complex enough that my group house-ruled a bunch of simplifications after one or two sessions.<br/><br/>A perhaps-obvious suggestion for running Star Wars is Lady Blackbird, which is of course already a Star Wars scenario repainted in steampunk-fantasy colors.

However, it's also an excellent example of controlling the way a game works by constraining the mechanical actions available to the players - when the list of things you can roll for includes "Awe", "Song", "Riddle" and "Courtesy" it's amazing how the game swings around to feel more like Middle Earth.  So if you don't feel overly confident in your ability to make a game FEEL like Middle Earth, then I endorse the system as something that gives you carefully curated tools to help with that. (I fall into this category - I LOVE Middle Earth, but I'm not remotely confident in my ability to evoke it consistently.  ToR made this easy, if the number of compliments I got from my players are any indication.)<br/><br/>Burning Wheel is, of course, another take on the angle - you don't need to have Luke tell you that it's basically Middle Earth with the serial numbers filed off (I mean FFS, the Elven Racial Trait is "Grief") but it makes The One Ring look like Basic D&amp;D by comparison, so it's totally off the table.  There's also a hack for Mouse Guard (Which is a Burning Wheel relative) called Realm Guard that is about playing Dunedain guarding the ruins of the realm of Arnor, but that's relatively constrained in subject - if you don't want to play Dunedain rangers, the game doesn't have much for you.<br/><br/>I don't have good suggestions on the others, though I think it might be interesting to try to run ASoIaF in a hacked up version of Houses of the Blooded, that'd be a nontrivial amount of work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459144/#Comment_459144" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T18:11:33+00:00" title="January 10, 2017  6:11PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since it hasn't been mentioned yet (I think), here's a link to the PBtA game called Fellowship: <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177662/Fellowship--A-Tabletop-Adventure-Game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177662/Fellowship--A-Tabletop-Adventure-Game</a><br/><br/>I have not bought it yet nor played it, so I don't know how good it is at delivering its promise of a LOTR type game.

Specifically, you could easily play a drama game (as in, important protagonists making tough choices) set in any of those settings with one of the generic vehicles - anything like Primetime Adventures, Dust Devils, Solar System, Heroquest, even Fate (which we discussed at length last week) will easily adapt to all three of those settings and provide its own take on what it's like to be a jedi/hobbit/prince in those worlds when the Story comes barreling at you.<br/><br/>I will particularly recommend <i>Tales of Entropy</i> (an upcoming story game, I think we discussed it at some point a bit) for your purposes here for a couple of reasons: it matches the campaign length you suggest very well; it is specifically designed to front-load a firm literary basis, while still making the actual gameplay all about the players and their ideas; it is easy to set up for each of those three settings, and the players will enjoy using the same system for three contrasting settings, while still having plenty of unique freedom to make each scenario an unique experience. If your plan is to play in all of those settings as a sort of a fantasy story game trilogy, then Entropy is probably one of the top picks for pushing the project to a successful completion. As a bonus, it is entirely feasible to "play the novel" with Entropy (as in, you play Frodo, I play Gandalf, and here's the One Ring, let's play to see what happens), if that strikes your fancy, instead of setting up a secondary story in the same setting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>Eero, thanks for reminding me about Tale of Entropy; I've yet to check it out, but I'm very interested in it.  Sometimes with all the games I'm reading and playing I forget some, even ones that I have a great interest in. I will read it and see if it fits the bill. I just picked up your Zombie Cinema game from IPR; any suggestions on how to get the best results running it at my gaming club. Same question for Solar System.  You can answer me here or send me a PM and I would appreciate it. Thanks :-) \n<blockquote><br/>It is, of course, possible to get more ambitious and detailed about the substance of each of those stories, and then there is the question of player interfacing - what will, exactly, be the role of the playgroup in adding to the corpus when there already exists a perfectly serviceable novel/movie? What is it that we want to do <i>with</i> the far-away galaxy, Middle-Earth and Westeros?<br/></blockquote>\nI want to emulate the fiction of the Star Wars movies, books like the Lord of the Rings, and the books of ASOIAF. So in Star Wars I want fantasy adventure,  in Lord of the Rings I want low fantasy and the sentiment of the books, and in ASOIAF I want courtly intrigue and adventure.<br/><br/>Assuming it was me planning to play these, and I wanted to get ambitious, while still sticking to a short campaign, here's my personalized picks for each of those stories:<br/><br/><b>Star Wars:</b> <i>Star Wars</i> is an ensemble adventure movie, so I would choose a party-based game. The story in the campaign needs to go big, epic and iconic, to match the feel of the movie. The setting is a conceptually rich space opera, so a game that can handle that conceptually (ship battles, statting up droids, aliens, whatever) is a must. Thematically there is leeway: it needs to be romantic (in the literary sense), but aside from that there is room to do stuff and still have a basis in the SW feel. Considering these factors, my choice would be <i>Heroquest</i> - the latest edition in particular is a perfectly streamlined princess play Sim adventure story game, and it's much more realistic to adapt it to a highly specific setting than Fate would be just for the giggles.</blockquote>\nFate, FEA, or FateLess maybe good options for this. I will look into Heroquest.  I skimmed it and if the table contents is an indication it seemed like it had a lot of trivial rules, but again this is just based on skimming the table contents. \n<blockquote><br/><b>The Lord of the Rings:</b> This is a morality play; I know that many focus on the Fellowship of the Ring, but that's not really what the story is about. Instead, you'll want a high-power drama game that allows for high contrasts in scale of action (because providence <i>will</i> make even the smaller things matter, and has meaningful rules for the internal life of the characters. Concepts such as moral absolutes and corruption are central. Characters are defined in terms of their social position more than their skill-sets. If you weren't crunch-averse I would recommend <i>Burning Wheel</i>, but that being the case, a slight hack of <i>Hero's Banner</i> is what surfaces for me: it'll be to the point, and the epic breadth of campaign play will actually help the setting breathe in a novel way that doesn't conflict with its basic feel.</blockquote>\nI'm very interested in playing Burning Wheel; I'm not always crunch-averse, it's just that if I invest the time I wanted to be in a really great system that pays off. I'm also interested in playing Pendragon. Again, I'm not opposed to  all traditional games; I just want to make sure they are good and will be a good fit for me.  Do you think that Burning Wheel might be too challenging for a Lord of the Rings type game? Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><br/><b>A Song of Ice and Fire:</b> Personally, I would probably go for a harsh challenge-game with power struggle, secrets and betrayal, but that'd quickly go beyond "story game", so let's stick to that. We want something with a grey moral world, huge ensemble cast, no unitary plot, but basically a blood opera with characters in harsh opposition to each other's interests, often in tragic manner. The obvious choice is <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, no question: in a campaign context it captures the necessary breadth of storytelling easily, having no difficulty with swapping protagonists in and out, jumping forward in time and so on.<br/><br/>"Personally, I would probably go for a harsh challenge-game with power struggle, secrets and betrayal..." </blockquote>\nThis is exactly what I'm looking for <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> What game would you suggest for such themes and gaming goals?<br/>Thank you so much Eero.

Characters start quite competent, which is generically appropriate for e.g. a Star Wars game, but it doesn't leave a ton of room for growth in power, so the advancement consists of lateral drift.<br/><br/>As a result, FAE uses the other common advancement scheme: at regular intervals (by accomplishing Milestone goals), characters change and evolve, mostly by rewriting the freeform abilities (Aspects and Stunts). I like the use of Milestones as flag and pacing mechanic, but the only opportunity for mechanical power advancement is both rare and generic (basically, just add one to an Approach or to your Refresh). <br/><br/>Compared to similar "growth as change" schemes (e.g. Mouseguard's), the advancement system feels (to me--ymmv, obviously) like it lacks depth. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that I love FAE! It's great for what it is. But, like other lite games (and more than some), it suffers from lack of depth in the long run.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459159/#Comment_459159" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T22:22:25+00:00" title="January 10, 2017 10:22PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I  definitely see where you're going with this, and think it would definitely be interesting.

Some of the "awful" results read more like "and you're left a hollow husk of your former self."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459161/#Comment_459161" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T23:27:21+00:00" title="January 10, 2017 11:27PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2017 2:29AM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459162/#Comment_459162" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T23:30:18+00:00" title="January 10, 2017 11:30PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> <br/>Sounds cool <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> If you try it out report back <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459166/#Comment_459166" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-11T01:47:08+00:00" title="January 11, 2017  1:47AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Archipelago</i> is a good game for playing characters in somebody else's fantasy or science fiction setting, based on literary sources.<br/><br/>I like Eero's analysis and suggestions a lot.<br/><br/>I don't know much about ASOIAF, but I'm also throwing in a suggestion based on other people's analysis of what it is: what about <i>It's Complicated</i>?

It just involves writing more Key Traits (which already exist in Lady Blackbird hacks, Solar System, First Quest, and my game the Bureau, among others). There are dozens (maybe hundreds?) of them floating around the internet.<br/><br/>I think Solar System/The Shadow of Yesterday is one of the best "everyone like this" games for romantic heroic adventure. Lady Blackbird and my Eowyn game are both based on that. I wouldn't overlook Solar System/TSoY for this purpose; it's almost the "industry standard" for this kind of gaming.<br/><br/>The old WEG Star Wars d6 game was great for just, you know, adventure Star Wars. (Except for, maybe, its handling of the Force.) But that's a traditional RPG (just a particularly fun one), so it may not suit your needs.<br/><br/>ASOIAF is the tricky one. What form does playing this take? Is there a GM? Do we jump around in time, or in locations, or not? Are characters disposable or not? Do we know ahead of time who the heroes are, and who they aren't? How long do we play for? What's the story "about"? How large is the scope of this thing, anyway?<br/><br/>These are all questions which are relatively easy to answer for Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, but very confusing when it comes to ASOIAF. I could easily see arguing for either side of any of those questions, and the larger plot about the White Walkers even suggests that the story may have, ultimately, a big "Heroes against the Big Bad" story underlaying all the grey-morality intrigue stuff, which complicates matters further.<br/><br/>There are some interesting AW hacks suitable for this (although I don't know of any that are completed and ready to go), like this one:<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=7085.0" rel="nofollow">apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=7085.0</a><br/><br/>Otherwise, I like Eero's suggestion of In a Wicked Age..., that would be an interesting way to do this. (Except that your story would be far less linear than in the novels; that could be a feature or a deal-breaker.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459172/#Comment_459172" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-11T02:48:39+00:00" title="January 11, 2017  2:48AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a nice tidbit (move) from the hack-in-progress I linked to:\n<blockquote>A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE<br/><br/>When\xa0calamity\xa0is\xa0about\xa0to\xa0strike\xa0and\xa0all\xa0hope\xa0is\xa0lost,\xa0roll+fate.\xa0On\xa0a\xa0hit,\xa0<br/>you're\xa0time\xa0has\xa0not\xa0come\xa0yet;\xa0the\xa0Bard\xa0will\xa0offer\xa0you\xa0an\xa0unlikely\xa0way\xa0out.\xa0<br/>On\xa010+,\xa0you\xa0have\xa0some\xa0greater\xa0role\xa0to\xa0play.\xa0Ask\xa0the\xa0Bard\xa0one\xa0question\xa0<br/>about\xa0your\xa0rescuer\xa0or\xa0miraculous\xa0change\xa0of\xa0luck.\xa0On\xa07\xad9,\xa0you\xa0are\xa0a\xa0part\xa0of\xa0<br/>someone\xa0else's\xa0plan\xa0\u2013\xa0they\xa0offer\xa0you\xa0a\xa0way\xa0out\xa0for\xa0a\xa0price,\xa0take\xa0it\xa0or\xa0leave\xa0<br/>it.\xa0<br/><br/>On\xa0a\xa0miss,\xa0calamity\xa0strikes\xa0true</blockquote>\nNotably, though, it doesn't say anything about what to do with the rules, or how to play the actual thing.

Especially in social situations.</i></b>Of course, the other aspects of a Fate game (i.e. the players always win) would be horrible for an ASOIAF game.  Out of all the worlds and fictions that I am trying to emulate ASOIAF is the most difficult and the one that I'm most interested in. That is the reason I making a game which creates the themes, the courtly intrigue, and most of all the dance of interpersonal connections and conflicts in the fiction, because I think I could do a better job of anything I've seen out there and I think it's a great challenge. But in interim,  I would like to play a game that does a good job and has some of these features (i.e. Setting a 'condition' for an advantage. Not to get any ideas for my game, as I have a very strong vision of what I want to do and I'm very happy with it,  but something I can play with my gaming club in the interim.  I appreciate all the suggestions I've been given such as PbtA games, TSoY/Solar System,  but <b>I'm hoping someone knows of a game that has a feature close to the set a 'condition'/create an advantage, which I have discussed above</b>.

The Apocalypse World "plusses forward" thing is only exceptional in how inflexible it is.<br/><br/>I mean, establishing that a character trusts another, and having specific mechanics for how much they trust, and how that impacts further events - that's precisely what the Effect rules in <i>Solar System</i> do. (Read the Solar System text, specifically, for this: the older TSoY text has the same principles in there, but they're not generalized yet, dealing mostly with lingering poisons and such.) It's a general rules-mechanical concept for portraying <i>any</i> lingering benefits, which is a great strength for a certain type of story game, as you can naturally have various types of prep and foreshadowing scenes that actually have mechanical impact for the climatic scenes. Also, unlike the AW version, the significance of the lingering benefit is not mechanized in advance, so the lingering situation remains fluid: when you establish trust, for example, you do not know for sure yet whether it will actually come to matter later, and how. (For example: will their trust enable you to do something great together, or will it enable you to stab them in the back?) If it does, though, the rules will tell you how to mechanize the impact. Something like one third of my more recent SS play has been about establishing and moving Effects around, something like that is really a great boon for a classical Forgite drama game just for pacing reasons if nothing else.\n<blockquote>I just picked up your Zombie Cinema game from IPR; any suggestions on how to get the best results running it at my gaming club. Same question for Solar System.  You can answer me here or send me a PM and I would appreciate it. Thanks :-) </blockquote>\nNice to hear that you got ZC; you might appreciate the way it goes about things. Those are good questions. Pretty wide in scope, but I'll lay out a few key points nevertheless:<br/><br/><b>For Zombie Cinema</b>, it's pretty fool-proof. The only way it can go awry, pretty much, is if the players are drama-blind and thus resort to trivial sitcom and destructive badgering of the other players instead of building up the story; the worst this will cause is just that the game might be sort of mediocre and pointless, so no big deal even then. This happens to something like 10% of random-pick game groups in my experience, as most people seem to get it without difficulty. For advanced notes on play strategy, you might wish to read <a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/zombiecinema/advice-for-play" rel="nofollow">my article on the website</a>.<br/><br/><b>For Solar System</b>, I recommend that you plan for a short 3-5 session campaign to begin with; it's possible to play the game as a one-shot, but it's really probably only feasible once you have some experience with the system. For subject matter, there are two feasible choices for a first campaign: either play a very minimalistic game with crunch created as needed in real time (very basic crunch, mostly just Keys and Effects and some bonus dice here and there - limit every character to just one Secret at start), set in a fresh setting uniquely interesting to the play group, <i>or</i> play <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> - either with the original text or <i>World of Near</i>, as preferred. The former option keeps the game simple enough that the players can do the crunch-development inherent to Solar System without difficulty, while the latter option provides much textual support for the crunch, thus reducing the need to develop your own for every little thing you might wish to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459225/#Comment_459225" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-13T07:07:00+00:00" title="January 13, 2017  7:07AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Fate, FEA, or FateLess maybe good options for this.

I skimmed it and if the table contents is an indication it seemed like it had a lot of trivial rules, but again this is just based on skimming the table contents.</blockquote>\nIt's really the total opposite - very streamlined and remarkably powerful. All that rules text is really just application advice, the actual core principles would fit on two pages. I will admit that I have my own issues with the drift the game has undergone from Nar to Sim over its three editions, but it has remained as clever mechanically as it ever was. It's definitely lighter and less convoluted than Fate, mechanically speaking.\n<blockquote>I'm very interested in playing Burning Wheel; I'm not always crunch-averse, it's just that if I invest the time I wanted to be in a really great system that pays off. I'm also interested in playing Pendragon. Again, I'm not opposed to  all traditional games; I just want to make sure they are good and will be a good fit for me.  Do you think that Burning Wheel might be too challenging for a Lord of the Rings type game? Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nIt's just perfect if you're comfortable with traditional levels of crunchiness - BW is not traditional in gameplay (more of a hybrid, like Fate or Heroquest or TSoY), but it is about as crunchy as say crunchier D&amp;D or GURPS or Hero System. Requires the players to have organized minds and focus, if they're to enjoy the system for its benefits.<br/><br/>The fit for a Middle-Earth game is excellent, I think; the game has the right amount of party-based adventuring compatibility, while remaining essentially protagonist-based, fully supporting the notion that every character individually is responsible for their response to the Dark Lord and the moral challenge he posits. If you got to break up the Fellowship, then you gotta break up the Fellowship, and that's that. A player can even give up their potential for protagonism and just go Gimli as somebody else's sidekick with no particular procedural problems.\n<blockquote>"Personally, I would probably go for a harsh challenge-game with power struggle, secrets and betrayal..." </blockquote>\nThis is exactly what I'm looking for <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> What game would you suggest for such themes and gaming goals?<br/><br/>Oh, I don't know if you would really want the thing I speculate about there - when I say "challenge-game" it's just a covert (hopefully less annoying and misleading for some people) reference to Forgite Gamism. What I envision would be something like a mix of Paranoia, Diplomacy and the Amber rpg, with the player characters as political movers and shakers of Westeros, each with their more-or-less conflicting goals. The gameplay would be essentially strategic in nature, with the players with-holding secrets from each other and maneuvering via a blind structure maintained by the GM. The game would ultimately end in utter defeat for some and triumph for others, determined by nothing less than the wisdom of the choices the players make as rulers and plotters. I'm doubtful of whether this is something you'd actually want, because a game where the players specifically <i>don't</i> tell each other what they're doing in the hopes of gaining strategic surprise is just about the polar opposite of a dramatic game.<br/><br/>Were I planning to do this thing in practice, I would have to mix up my own game for it, as I am not aware of there existing a truly credible chassis for something like this on the market. I would probably use either Amber or D&amp;D as the base, with maybe a Diplomacy-like wargame overlay (it's an enticing idea, would do much to make things more concrete), modern relationship maps for the social dimension, and a heaving helpful of the general intrigue-gamism lessons I learned from playing a long Paranoia campaign a while back.<br/><br/>That being said, I think that <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, which I suggested, would be an excellent choice for a drama game take on Westeros. It's still going to be full of intrigue, sex and betrayal, and all the moral ambivalence one could hope for, plus excellent support for an ensemble cast. I'm in no way trying to say that my idea about a challengeful intrigue strategy game would be somehow superior to playing a story-focused drama game in the same setting - far from it.<br/><br/>Also, Solar System is a possibility, as discussed before. It's got the tools for, among other things, A Song of Ice and Fire. Saying this just isn't that meaningful because it's a powerful generic system, so just like any of those it can run just about anything. Whether it <i>should</i> depends on if you like how it goes about doing things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459226/#Comment_459226" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-13T07:09:24+00:00" title="January 13, 2017  7:09AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2017 7:27AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think your expectations for a game which delivers on the whole "plotting and intrigue" dimension haven't been met yet, by existing game design*.

Its setting is provocative if you're into conspiracy horror (and can bring the colorful phantasmagoria yourself - the game hardly provides anything except a barebones setting framework), and the rules are robust yet relatively standard fare for a Forgite game. It gets one Michelin star from me - definitely a sensible pick if the subject matter happens to appeal, yet not special enough to justify going out of your way to get it, study it and play for the sake of novelty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459250/#Comment_459250" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-13T18:58:23+00:00" title="January 13, 2017  6:58PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool Eero, thanks for the thoughtful reply <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459258/#Comment_459258" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-14T02:26:56+00:00" title="January 14, 2017  2:26AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>It should come as no surprise to you that I'd love to see a Diplomacy-like story/roleplaying game. I think it would be an interesting thing to tackle - a game where players challenge each other and perform intrigue.<br/><br/>I suppose the closest we've seen to that historically are large-scale LARPs and Braunstein-type games.<br/><br/>I tried to start a thread about this many years ago, although it didn't get too far:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13435/diplomacy-inspired-design-in-a-story-game-medium" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13435/diplomacy-inspired-design-in-a-story-game-medium</a><br/><br/>My hunch is that Jeff's interest in an ASOIAF game is more of the collaborative storytelling variety, however, not hardcore player-vs-player play. (Which, as you point out, is more or less the antithesis of dramatic roleplaying.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459260/#Comment_459260" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-14T02:34:40+00:00" title="January 14, 2017  2:34AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My immediate idea is to develop something like a Diplomacy boardgame, but with various moves corresponding to fictional prompts, which, in return, create fictional material for the game.<br/><br/>For instance, we might see players A and B successful pull off an invasion of a part of the map, which allows Kingdom X to develop a solution to its famine problem. However, to do so, they have to move a unit off the "financial safety" square on the board, which then instructs the GM to make a "move" (in the AW sense) against one of their characters, threatening them: perhaps one of the funders of their expedition backs out at the last minute, leaving them without financial backing a week before they are supposed to set out.<br/><br/>Having a larger-scale "boardgame" which messes with the larger setting (starting and ending wars, creating other large-scale effects, influencing immigration and trade) which then interacts with the small-scale stories of the characters at a more "zoomed-in" level could be quite interesting.<br/><br/>I can even imagine some rules where a character's fictional positioning affects the moves the player is able to make on the board. For instance, perhaps you must have a character reach the Duke of Gooble, have an intimate scene with him, and succeed in a roll in order to be able to - as the player - move one of the units on the map which represents the Dukedom of Gooble. Moving that unit, then, will correspond to changes in the Situation for some of the other characters in the "zoomed-in" story level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459305/#Comment_459305" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-15T19:06:17+00:00" title="January 15, 2017  7:06PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case the suggestion is not clear, part of what would make the game work is that "secret information" and player-vs-player competition would be happening at one level of remove from the "storytelling" aspects of the game. We "zoom out" to handle large-scale competition, and this forms the backdrop for the in-character scenes, where the players can approach play in a more typical RPG-style collaborative fashion, working together to create drama, good scenes, and vibrant characters.<br/><br/>Another way to make this work is to have the players who are acting competitively removed from the "collaborative fiction" phases of play. For instance, you and Bob play out a scene in the story. Then Lucy and I get to play a token or make a move on the game board, which is influenced (but in a neutral fashion) by the scene just played out. This allows you and Bob to freely create fiction, while Lucy and I are freed to pursue competition. For the next scene, we switch roles. And so on.<br/><br/>Using the "Dipomacy" backdrop for the sake of the example, we'd have a board with moving pieces on it. On your turn, you and Bob pick an area of the map where to set a scene, and play it out freely. Once the scene is done, Lucy and I can make moves on the board, but only in the place where the scene took place and adjacent territories. Perhaps the type of scene you end up having affects our decisions, too - I choose to mark your scene as "consequential", which gives me a point of some currency, while Lucy marks a developing relationship between the two nations portrayed by the characters you and Bob chose in the scene, which affects future moves in some other fashion.<br/><br/>I could see such a framework in action - it would be a relatively weighty and in-depth game, with lots of room to explore and master ramifications, but it would create a world-spanning story like ASOIAF very effectively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
