It is not an RPG, but I would say that it is a Story Game. And <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2007/03/sxsw_will_wrigh.html" rel="nofollow">Will Wright's SXSW keynote</a> came to my mind.<br/><br/>The concept of the game itself is, that they give the players the planet (Arrakis, known as Dune) on the board and the players play various political forces (Atreides, Harkonnen, Fremen etc.), but the game is mostly stripped bare of all kind of story of the book. (The map itself is somewhat anacronistic, too.) So the story is written by the players themselves. It is all about interaction and first I saw no prewritten happenings. It seemed a fun game (I haven't tried yet), until I found one treachery card, namely the Family Atomix. Without spoiling anything if someone hasn't read the book, it causes something that happens originally at the climax of the novel. I think it totally ruins the game, because it forces something on the game that isn't naturally a part of it.<br/><br/>My problem is: I like prewritten stories, if they are good. Well, I didn't like the cutscenes in Doom3, but I very much liked the prewritten story in Half-life 1-2.<br/><br/>Is it possible for a prewritten story to coexist with playerwritten stories? Do these stories ruin each other? Is it possible for a story written by players to be as deep as a prewritten story? Is it needed to be that deep or the fun part is to write something on the fly without any concern if it will be "good" whatever it be?<br/><br/>I know, these are generic and hard questions, but it would suffice me even if you would answer regarding Dune boardgame: why do you think does the prewritten story element damage the game - even if I like prewritten stories?<br/><br/>Gabor                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69522/#Comment_69522" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T04:46:47+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  4:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Algi,<br/><br/>You're asking a number of questions here. First, I'm curious about the Dune boardgame. What's the goal? Is it explicitly about taking over the entire board? What do you mean that the players make-up the story?

I have played similar games though.  I think there is a tendency for some roleplayers to turn pretty much any game into a story.  That is, they come up with story reasons to back up events in even the most abstract games.<br/><br/>But more directly: The future history presented in Traveller 2300/2300AD was created by playing a similar game.  The developers created a game to play and played one hell of an epic, from 2000 up to 2300AD and used that as the basis of their setting.  Which I think is wicked.  The idea of using a board game to dictate the starting position of an RPG setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69544/#Comment_69544" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T06:27:16+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  6:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Timfire, <br/><br/>Well, it isn't stated explicitly that you should tell a story. But there are several causes I would call Dune Boardgame a Story Game:<br/><br/>1) It is based upon a novel and the players' decisions are defining what conflicts are fought among the heroes of the novel.<br/><br/>2) In the introduction it is stated, that this game is about what could have happened instead of the story of the novel.<br/><br/>3) There are many optional rules that are based upon the world of Dune wich modify the gameplay greatly. I assume the point was that you should feel that all this is hapenning on Dune and not only a who wins who loses game.<br/><br/>4) It is not at all an abstract game. The board is the scanned map from the back of the book, the players have advantages and seperate goals based upon their role in the novels. (They even have something like a GM's screen wich depicts their characters.)<br/><br/>5) Every rule of the game is based on facts from the novels. (Mostly the first one, but not only.) For example when paying for travel from off-planet to planet-side, the price is payed to the Guild Player. Etc.<br/><br/>So, that is why I think Dune BG can be called a story game, even if it isn't evolving around the verbally phrasing of the story. The players are telling the story by choosing their fights, their friends and playing treachery cards (wich are explicit weapons from the book). So I wouldn't call chess a story game, nor would I call most CCGs a story game, not even if they are based upon coherent fictional worlds, because the former is too abstract and the latter is too random. But I would call the Red Dwarf games (Barbarian Prince etc.) a Story Game. I would even call some wargames story game, for example Warhammer 40k. They are fighting whole campaings with great fictional stakes.<br/><br/>The basic goal of the game is to claim three or four of the special terrirories called "fortresses", but there are personal goals of the players wich are alternative victory conditions. (For example the goal of the Guild is that noone should win until the end of the 15th round, the Bene Gesserit can win if the player foretells wich player wins in wich round, etc.) These differences of characters give an important favor (a spicy one) to the game.<br/><br/>Rich,<br/><br/>I think in this case even the "normal" boardgamer geeks came up with house rules based on the fiction and even they were imagining that they are the characters of the story.<br/><br/>It sounds fun that one game is influencing another, but I don't like really when the designers themselves not only tell you, that THIS is the metastory, nothing else, but they even anger the players by telling "And we played a fun game by creating it that you'll never play, because it is already over and in effect." Why didn't they give the players the boardgame and tell the rules to convert its outcome to a setting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Old%20Scratch" title="Old Scratch"><img alt="Old Scratch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Old%20Scratch">Old Scratch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69582/#Comment_69582" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T07:47:49+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  7:47AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Dune. Dune is no more a story game than the A Game of Thrones board game or card games are story games. It's a gamist simulation using the story as a template. It's what we call "theme" in board games... and of course a narrative develops through play, just as happens when you play War of the Ring.<br/><br/>Now, this game is an intriguing and interesting game which is a hell of a lot of fun to play. It does a great job of emulating the feel of the world and has some remarkably clever game play mechanics. I also have to disagree that the family atomics ruins the game at all. After having played this game for over a decade and based upon actual play experience, I don't see a problem here.<br/><br/>Now, for the meat of your post: can player written stories exist along side the canon material. Yes. It always has. People are always coming up with "What if..." scenarios and there are many, many games that address original source material and play off of it, I would argue that this "What if..." and the validity of player-created narratives are fundamental to the nature of wargames and board game (What if Hitler did X in Third Reich. What if Lee did X at Gettyburg, What if Sauron tried to seize the Shire). In fact, I'd argue that the boardgame/wargame/card game approach might be far less problematic than the roleplaying game/story game approach.<br/><br/>My point: Middle Earth. There have been at least four war/board games (and one computer game) recreating the struggle for the Middle Earth, I've played all but one and enjoy them, in particular the War of the Ring. The narratives that emerge organically out of play are pretty dramatic. I enjoy the "What if..." aspect of the game tied into the goal of obtaining objectives. Now, I also happen to own MERP... I personally feel that when it comes to rpgs that such direct emulation is problematic because that narrative, typically rather than being a variation on the original story has to try to emerge from the long shadow of its source material, and I think few games pull this off. In a sense, I personally question the validity of the the play narrative as it is hung up in all kinds of issues: Are we faithfully to the source setting, are we all on the same page here, do we need to adopt a slavish approach to the canon, how can we capture the essence of the setting yet put our own stamp on it. After a while, I've found that trying to play Middle Earth or Hyboria or Westeros or where ever is an ordeal for those players. Yet when you take those games and turn them into wargames, the players issues with the setting tend to vanish.<br/><br/>Thus I can't help but feel that the success of these wargames and boardgames exploits exactly that which makes a roleplaying game in the same setting much less appealing. These simulations give us a chance to rewrite the history of the setting. The goal for an rpg is a bit different however and I find that taking those things you like from setting X and then creating a new setting is a way of getting around that, and that's why I'd rather play BW's Jihad over WotC's Dune any day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69588/#Comment_69588" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T07:53:47+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  7:53AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2007 7:55AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Edited to note that this is wonderfully cross-posted with Garret's post above... he beat me in by about 6 minutes]<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played this edition of this game. As a quick description, it's mechanics are, essentially, Cosmic Encounter, but where there are only six positions one can play, Guild, Emperor, Atredies, Bene Gesserit, Harkonen, and Fremen. As in CE, each has it's own special ability, like Gabor mentioned with the Guild getting paid for transporting troops. At the linked site, you can see on the play aid what the abilities are on the back side. The other difference is that instead of cards in CE being used to modify battle results, adding them to troops, the player commits characters from his arsenal. And there are "Treachery" cards (the baron, of course, gets extra) that can modify outcomes of fights, or have other effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, the goal of the game is to win control of Arrakis by getting control of the majority of the red spaces or something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it's a story game, then so is Gettysburg. It's a wargame, like most others, set before a conflict, where you get to figure out "What would happen if I were the General leading the forces instead of Robert E Lee? In other words, it's not at all a story game, in that, as I understand it, Story Games are RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a "Storyish" boardgame, tho. And the general discussion point is still a good one. Let's look at a much more precise example, IMO, that of Middle Earth RPG. It's very easy to set a game up just prior to the War of the Rings, and have the players play Frodo and gang. And come up with their own story about the fate of the One Ring. The books even give you the stats for the characters at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut would you play it? I wouldn't. Because the result is going to pale in comparison to what Tolkien wrote. Or, if by some chance we do make something better... now I've got two versions of the same story...<br/>\n<br/>\nNope, not interested. This is a personal thing, and I expect that many people out there are not like me in this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had this precise discusion, in fact, regarding playing the Dune RPG. That one is interesting in that it decides to play previous to the events of the books. What's problematic about this, however, is that one of three things must happen:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You let play continue on into the era of the books, and affect what happens there.<br/>\n2) Play stays before the book era, but events of a certain magnitude are allowed such that it would affect the book era.<br/>\n3) Play stays before the book ere, but events are capped in importance so that the canon can later occur intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with 1 and 2 is the same as the Middle Earth problem above. You're screwing up the author's original vision. The problem with 3 is that it limits what the characters can do artificially.<br/>\n<br/>\nRon Edwards had a style of play he hypothesized about called "Playing the Underbelly" where the players agree to play minor characters who's lives and passions exist in the shadow of the known metaplot. That is, you play "Star Wars" but you play out the events of the lives of a few people on a planet far from the center of the rebellion who do not have an impact on the metaplot, and where the metaplot only serves to create an overall source of conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile viable, the problem I have with "underbelly" play is that when I think of Star Wars, and the sort of action that it entails, I think of Luke Skywalker battling Darth Vader. That is, people key to the entire rebellion dealing with each other personally, and so shaping the fate of their galactic government. If I'm not playing that... I'm not playing Star Wars. Rather, if we're playing on some backwater, why does it even need to be in the SW universe? So we can have Wookies?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd personally rather just play in the Traveller Universe. There, we can either play the events of a small backwater, or get involved with the rebellion and high stakes stuff, and tell precisely the sort of story we want, without any worry that we're mucking with our own vision of the source material.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other suggested idea is to play the game in another era, such that you don't impact what's written... often after the events of the source material. Playing Middle Earth in the Fourth Age, or playing out the as yet unwritten three Star Wars films. To me, this always smacks of "more-ism" if you will. That is, if some of it was good, more of it will be better. If we tack on a fourth age to the stories of Middle Earth, that'll make our feeling for Middle Earth all the stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think it cheapens things, personally. If Tolkien had thought that it was a good idea to write whole stories about the Fourth Age, he probably would have done so, or at least have left notes about such a story. As it was, he wrote lots of notes about the Fourth Age, and events that happened... but they were always denoument. He writes somewhere that Legolas and Gimli take a ship to the West after fixing up Ithilien or somesuch, IIRC, making them the last of the fellowship to pass on that way, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese stories have already been written, with beginning, middle, and end. We're too late to be part of the creation. The most we can do is make pale shadows that mock the original.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore below...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69589/#Comment_69589" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T07:54:07+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  7:54AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...Continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's great about RPGs is that somebody can write up a world like Middle Earth, but where the important history bits have not been written up yet. Demanding that the players write them.  We can make our own great stories. Oh, perhaps not as great as Tolkien's, but original at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider this, did Lucas write up his SW universe and then create Luke Skywalker to be run through it? No, he created a plot, and the universe came into being as needed by the plot. This is absurdly obvious at times in his work, in fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Tolkien actually came up with the Elven language first, and people say he then came up with Middle Earth as a place for that language to exist. So he could explain how the language developed. So you might think that the setting pre-exists the characters. But this is not so. Tolkien's entire thesis is that language comes about as needed to understand things, and that traditionally this understanding is provided by myth. That is, he didn't create a "Setting" he created myths. Stories. Plots. He even said that his intent was to give England a mythology that fit it's culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe world of Middle Earth is... Earth. It's just an Earth told through the lens of place names and such that are from some fictional previous people. Based off of actual myths, as it happens. See the Neibelungen (and it's sources) and the Eddas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe story comes first, and the details of the world surround it as need be. Because this is the process, in fact, you have some absurdities in the Middle Earth RPG publications. Considering Tolkien's words to all be canon (as far as they're non-contradictory), they assume that the world is "complete" as shown. That is, if it's not in a book by Tolkien somewhere, it's not in their books. Oh, certainly they extrapolate from what is in the books. If there's the "Inn of the Prancing Pony" in Bree, then there might be an inn in Archet.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's nothing in between Bree and Rivendell. Or at least according to their maps. Which doesn't make any sense in a real world fashion, given the description of the land.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be that he didn't mention any villages on the stretch because... he didn't need them for any of his stories? As opposed to ommission meaning that they're not there? Sure, Tolkien details his world far better than almost any other fantasy author. It's tempting to think that it is complete. But I rather think that if he had written more stories, that more parts of the setting would have appeared as neccessary to support the stories in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPGs have this tradition, however, that the world that the characters are travelling inside is "complete." That is, that it exists without them, and does not evolve to meet the dramatic needs of the players of the characters inside of it. This is a fiction, no world could ever actually be complete, but the feeling that it is complete is important to some players (why is a whole 'nother thread). For some of those people, what they could be looking for is a chance to steal inside of Middle Earth, and get a feeling for what it might be like to exist there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that this sort of play doesn't lead to stories. It leads to something like life inside Middle Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a story out of play, one crafted by the players, then chuck the notion of the world being pre-existing. Make up the world you need for the needs of the play, as you need it. This is sometimes referred to as "No Myth" play for obscure reasons, but the point is that the world created serves the dramatic needs of the players, not a need for the setting to be "hard" to the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, the first thing to do is to create a world to support the characters you want to play. Yeah it can be hard to make up characters in a vaccuum, but not impossible. If players insist on having some idea of what the world is like before they make up characters, then give as little as possible to get them going. And then, once the charcters are made, figure out the nature of the world around them such that it propells the characters into adventure, and just follow the players' cues on what to create next.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr... that's what works for me in play, anyhow. Can pre-existing story exist with player-written story? Well, it's possible. But, well, why bother? Let those stories remain finished, and make your own story... with setting to suit it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty" title="MummyKitty"><img alt="MummyKitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/582/nF6IT7RM67QPV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MummyKitty">MummyKitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69645/#Comment_69645" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T09:52:52+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  9:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play a lot of board games, probably more than I play role playing games.  I think there is an element of role playing, or story telling if you will, in any game, especially ones that are based on stories or historical.  Games can play out completely differently based on the personality of the players.  I played the hell out of Dune when I was a kid with my brother and friends.  We knew each other's style and personalities and used that to our advantage in the game.  When I recently played Dune at a convention with people I didn't know, the game was completely different.  It was a lot more fun when you knew your enemy.  That way when they did something surprising, it felt surprising, not just a random dumb move by someone you don't know.  Is it a role playing or story game?  No, but even a board game has a human element that lends some of the feel of a story game to it.  Just some rambling thoughts, I guess I don't have a real point here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69916/#Comment_69916" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T01:21:21+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  1:21AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>The story comes first, and the details of the world surround it as need be. Because this is the process, in fact, you have some absurdities in the Middle Earth RPG publications. Considering Tolkien's words to all be canon (as far as they're non-contradictory), they assume that the world is "complete" as shown. That is, if it's not in a book by Tolkien somewhere, it's not in their books. Oh, certainly they extrapolate from what is in the books. If there's the "Inn of the Prancing Pony" in Bree, then there might be an inn in Archet.<br><br>But there's nothing in between Bree and Rivendell. Or at least according to their maps. Which doesn't make any sense in a real world fashion, given the description of the land.<br><br>Could it be that he didn't mention any villages on the stretch because... he didn't need them for any of his stories? As opposed to ommission meaning that they're not there? Sure, Tolkien details his world far better than almost any other fantasy author. It's tempting to think that it is complete. But I rather think that if he had written more stories, that more parts of the setting would have appeared as neccessary to support the stories in question.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nTrue dat. Hell, look at the journey to Rivendell in the Hobbit versus in Fellowship. There's nothing between <i>Hobbiton</i> and Bree! (Well, Bywater, actually.) You've got I think the most sensible and cool explanation of what's really going on here, and what Tolkien's really all about.

At least now I know somewhat better what a Story Game is.<br><br>MummyKitty,<br><br>I think your observations are very important, mostly in game design. I recently had a conversation about the human element in games. The point was, it is not enough to make a game mechanism that is "optimal", but you have to consider the human factor of the players. Thatswhy even the simplest games have to be playtested, because by the designing table, you never know what will suck with real people and what won't.<br><br>And especially in a game with the them of Dune it is important to know your enemy. The whole novel was about knowing your enemies.<br><br>Mike,<br><br>As I read you, I can only totally agree with you. But I see other possibilities than "No Myth" game. I attended a lecture about RPGs and we spoke about the "World Creating" process of fiction. For example "A New Hope" was the creator of the SW setting, The Lord of the Rings (not The Hobbit and not The Silmarillion) was the creator of the Middle-Earth setting. I think it can be explained by looking at wich fiction is defining all parts of the setting. In The Hobbit there weren't any "gods" influencing the story, in The Silmarillion there weren't any cute hobbits with mostly gardening problems. That means the book The Lord of the Rings created the Middle-Earth with hobbits and with "gods" where these two have met.<br><br>The point of this distinction was that the sequels (or prequels and any other continuation) of these fictions will be of lesser "quality" in some sense. It is a very controversial and subjective point, but I think it is true. Take for example Star Wars ep I-II-III (or even VI) or the sequels of Dune written by Frank Herbert himself. Or even let's take The Hobbit wich didn't became as successful as LotR.<br><br>I think for example, that if I would GM a Star Wars game, it would be quite easy for me to discard what happened in the first three episodes, thus the PCs could even play Anakin, Obi-Wan, etc. rewriting the story, but using what we like from the setting (droid army, siths, etc.). If we accept the above assumption, that it happens all the time with fantasy fiction in such parallel created worlds, there is a whole lot of possibilities in fantasy literature. For example by playing Dune we could accept what happened in the first book (wich is a trilogy) and use the world described in the sequels but change the story. (And by fantasy I don't mean sword and sorcery, but any fiction that leads us to another world.)<br><br>And maybe there is another possibility: the open endedness of the settings. In Middle-Earth there are the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Wizards" rel="nofollow">blue wizards</a>", in SW there are the other Siths (mentioned in the Star Wars novel and later discarded in the prequels). Sure it is even more a half solution than the forementioned one, because they are further from the pivotal points of the setting.<br><br>Particularly I was thinking about a Babylon 5 fanmade RPG, in wich the party should choose an era different from the depicted ones. There is the original (Babylon 5 station with 5 year arc), the one of Crusade (one ship to save Earth), the one of Legend of the Rangers (rangers to save the galaxy) etc. So the original shows did have more eras that were equally important. So, I think it is possible to have even more eras without meeting the ones presented. One of the first tasks of the party were to define the borders of the setting. For example if it is the world of Ikarra 7 (mentioned in one of the episodes), then it will be not possible for their story to exit this setting. It is possible for them to travel to someplace else, but it will be always recognized as "far away". I am seeing this as an ultimate solution for Babylon 5, but this is a special case, because the author showed us how to explore new eras.<br><br>The problem with LotR and Dune and SW is that they have one pivotal era and all the other sequels and prequels are only appendices of that pivotal era and not other eras of the same importance.<br><br>Old Scratch,<br><br>I haven't played the game yet, so I believe you. It was just that I didn't like that rule, and it ruined for me subjectively the gamerules (wich were absent except this from the original story) and not the gameplay. So, I'll give it a try and we'll see.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
