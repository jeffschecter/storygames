I might be starting a PTA series in a couple of days, it will be the third one for me and I feel very comfortable with the system and general techniques we will use. I have been the Producer for both of the earlier games we played, and now that I started thinking about it I realized that I never really thought that much about the way I prep a PTA game. Now obviously you can't go and prepare too much stuff since everyone around the table has more or less equal input into what's going on in the fiction, but perhaps there are some tricks or techniques that are more suitable than others for the game? I think I usually just come up with a couple of bang-like scenes that I can use to get the ball rolling, but more often than not I find that they're not really needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does anyone have any neat little tricks or just hings they always do that seem to work? Things you've tried that definitely did NOT work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Claudia%20Cangini" title="Claudia Cangini"><img alt="Claudia Cangini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Claudia%20Cangini">Claudia Cangini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92015/#Comment_92015" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T02:21:40+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  2:21AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johan Granberg</cite> I think I usually just come up with a couple of bang-like scenes that I can use to get the ball rolling, but more often than not I find that they're not really needed.<br/></blockquote>\nHi Johan,<br/>I love being the producer in PtA and did it for a couple of games.<br/>My method is basically like yours: I make sure to go into every session with at least 1 or 2 bangs ready for each character and usually end up not even using all of them.<br/>I'm extremely lazy and hate long prep so PtA is one of the few games I feel apt to moderate <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92030/#Comment_92030" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T05:56:28+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  5:56AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I prep the same way Claudia does, if that.

Once I get buy-in, I think about how to frame that scene for maximum effect. So, the players pretty much know how the episode's going to start before we even sit down to play. <br/><br/>I find this kickstarts the momentum from the get-go pretty nicely. If we're all like, "So, this week, Lord Coxstar totally has to blow up Nikki's parents' house and touch off her Uncontrolled Rage issue," in the pre-game powwow, the cast has had some time to think about where to go from there.<br/><br/>Here's an interesting thing, though: I break this pattern regarding spotlight episodes. Usually, I'll make up Bangs for each person's spotlight episode pretty much after the pilot or first episode, and not consult the players about them at all. Of course, if a player gets a strong idea of what they want to confront in their spotlight, their ideas take precedence, and I always tell each group that I'm deliberately keeping their spotlight Bangs from them, in case they have a problem with that.<br/><br/>Like, I had one game where a protagonist had a self-loathing issue, because since his wife died, he turned gradually into a person he knew she'd have hated. So I was like, "Clearly, he has to find out that his wife had a daughter he didn't know about, who shows up in his life to call a lot of his assumptions into question, and/or give him the opportunity to start redeeming himself."<br/><br/>Usually, it's worked out to decent effect, because the big confrontation with their issue comes as a complete surprise, which can create stronger visceral reactions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92285/#Comment_92285" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T13:17:17+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:17PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have any assistants I can trust enough to serve me food, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92290/#Comment_92290" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T13:26:35+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  1:26PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's why you have an intern taste it for you!
