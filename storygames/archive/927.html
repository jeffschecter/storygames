                    OK, I happen to have a <a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/application?namespace=browse&amp;origin=searchMain.jsp&amp;event=link.itemDetails&amp;demandPrefix=12&amp;sku=51/38&amp;mode=Searching&amp;erec=2&amp;D=ticket&amp;Ntt=ticket&amp;Ntk=all&amp;Dx=mode%252bmatchallpartial&amp;Ntx=mode%252bmatchallpartial&amp;y=0&amp;N=0&amp;x=0&amp;sd=YELLOW+STAR+SINGLE+ROLL+TICKETS" rel="nofollow">huge wheel of raffle tickets</a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the paper ones, each with an individual serial number, like Ã¢â‚¬Å“7761519Ã¢â‚¬Â printed on it.  Mine are hot pink and have a pretty star on them (don't ask).  This morning I was staring at them and it occurred to me that they would make a great game thingy.  HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how it could work:<br/><br/>Give everybody a string of ten tickets.  These will have serial numbers ending in 0 to 9.  This is the ticketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relative power in conflict resolution.  Where you start doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter, if you count out ten, every number will be represented.  In fact it is better if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t start with a ticket ending in 0.  <br/><br/>Each player writes a word on the back of each ticket Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thinking there will be a canonical list of stuff to choose from, like Ã¢â‚¬Å“reversalÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“betrayalÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“outsiderÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“victoryÃ¢â‚¬Â or whatever, things that are thematically appropriate plot complications that leave a lot of leeway for interpretation.  You can match these to the number, making certain words very powerful and others not so much.  A constrained list from which everyone chooses and orders makes the most sense to me.  Or maybe your words are unrestricted, who knows?<br/><br/>At any point during the game, each player will have two tickets he could play Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the ones on either end.  When you introduce one into the narrative, you tear it off your string, leaving you with a different possibility on one end Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a new ticket is available, but your string gets shorter and shorter.  <br/><br/>Maybe there are decision points during which every player tears off a ticket, and the highest power ticketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s word is the one that is brought into the story, but the lowest number narrates.  There would be ten scenes in this model.  <br/><br/>Obivously the raffle tickets add a tremendous amount of goofy flavor, but could be replaced by index cards or scraps of paper easily enough.  But the tickets are like 3 dollars for 2000.<br/><br/>I think this game would have to be about a the lives and loves of a traveling carnival.                </div>

And what do you do at a carnival? You pay tickets to go on the rides. The best rides cost more tickets.                        </div>

                            Holy crap, but yes.  So you can feed tickets to a conflict/decision point until you win, at which point you've got a small pile of words that must be threaded into the narrative.  More power = more complexity.  That's fun.                        </div>

And what do you do when you run out of tickets? You can beg mommy and daddy to buy you more, but that's hard. The nice man in the patchwork coat has a whole strip of tickets for you, over there behind the big top.<br/>

Okay, that just took a turn.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br><br>It looks like there's a good possbility that plot elements from the big list might never get introduced if folks choose their numbers just right, but I'm not positive here. Let's see.. For the sake of example, let's just say that four players have written their raffle strip as below, and each is going to rip off their first ticket, always.<br><br>Alice: ABCDEFGHIJ (1-10)<br>Bob: ABCDEFGHIJ (1-10)<br>Eve: ABCDEFGHIJ (1-10)<br/>Fritz: JIHGFEDCBA (6-5)<br/><br/>In this case, wouldn't plot elements FGHIJ get dropped out completely? I think you want to prevent this, yes? It's cool and all that we see a story ABCDEEDCBA, but if we've spent effort coming up with FGHIJ, then they shouldn't be out forever.<br/><br/>I only read the sample through once, so I may very well have missed a point or two.<br/><br/>Set aside the contrived example for a moment, and think about what happens to the discarded tickets- Why aren't they going into a hat for players to pull from later in the game?<br/><br/>MDK                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey MDK, Remi and I actually played this yesterday and it works great.  <br/><br/>Yes, setting elements can be left out completely - but when that happens, it means that another setting element will be introduced twice, which is really cool.  One of ours was "child in danger", and when that came back a second time we were both like "Oh, that's so totally the same kid."<br/><br/>It seemed like the ones that got thrown out were the weakest ones, but that might just be luck.  One that never showed up was "IRS audit", I believe.  <br/><br/>What we learned by trying it is that <br/><br/>1.  It is probably optimized for two players.<br/>2.  Each "story" is a set of five conflicts, with one ticket setting it up and the next ticket resolving it.<br/>3.  Three "stories" can be chained together to form a compelling narrative, with the third re-introducing elements from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  <br/>4.  This whole thing is strongly influenced by improv.  <br/>5.  The character and setting element introduction is super fun.  There's a tactical element to it, but also a narrative imperative.  One time I *really* wanted to introduce "riot!" but it had a low number, which meant I wouldn't get to narrate if I played it.  <br/>6.  Remi remarked that it plays like a dirtier, hippier AG&amp;G.  I'm not sure about that, but it was really fun.                        </div>

I completely can see this- it makes perfect sense. But you say raffle mechanic, and I want to see tickets pulled from a hat in one way or another. Maybe you can pull from the hat to boost your number, but you have to narrate from the pulled ticket, not yours.

I'd like to hear what happens when you drag more players into it; I've been on a multi-person bidding kick recently and therefore am living vicariously through yall.<br/><br/>I like the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> tactical observation; good to hear it worked out in play!<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            Cool, thanks for the feedback, Mischa.  <br/><br/>I also want to try it with 3-4 people, since that was what I had in mind initially, but it went very well with two - creating plot/setting elements was easy and equally distributed with simple turn-taking, and laying down three tickets per scene seemed about right (the low player's settinga nd each player's character element).  Also, we did it with simple stake-setting at the end of each odd-numbered scene, and that would get a little confusing with more players, possibly.  Unless individual characters are divorced from players, which would also be fine - in our second scene, Remi's guy didn't show up and we were totally OK with it.  <br/><br/>Another reason it might fall down with more than two is that everyone must burn the same number of tickets at the same time, as currently imagined.  <br/><br/>It's also noteworthy that it was <em>completely useful</em> to playtest what amounts to a half-baked idea - I came away from two hours of experimentation with some solid insight into the design and its limitations.<br/><br/>Oh!  And the raffle ticket thing?  It's using the tickets as physical objects, rather than including any bidding/auctioning mechanic.  But I'm open to suggestions.                        </div>

                            I'd like to jump in and try to explain how the raffle tickets worked, because it was a neat example of scarcity of resources resulting in strategic play.<br/><br/>So for each Act (I ended up thinking of them as acts, not scenes, even though we only finished the second act, our game was clearly a three-story arc about the redemption of a wayward clown) you got two sets of 10 raffle tickets, with numbers 0-9. So you might have the following numbers (you could choose where the tickets 'start') on both sets tickets:<br/>4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3<br/>4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3<br/><br/>On the back of each ticket is written one of the shared 'setting' elements, or one of your own 'personal' elements. Each round you choose two ticket to tear off and throw down, when you do so, you announce your total. Highest total get narration rights, but doesn't get their setting element.<br/><br/>Let's say that you really want to 'blow up' your opponent for the last 3 scenes in the Act, so you want to save your 7's, 8's, and 9's. You've only got two of each, and the 9's, especially, are powerhouses. However, if the other player isn't keep close track of his numbers, you will be able to win with two 15's and an 18. Of course, you're sacrificing your beginning and middle for an ass-kicking end, but it's probably even across the entire game<br/><br/>The above example is exactly what I did in our second Act. Since the story was very much Jason's character (the clown) vs. The Evil Circus Vampires, the story ended pretty poorly for his poor character, but doubtless next time he would save some high-value tickets for his last finale.<br/><br/>I'd also like to add that the mechanic for ties is awesome. You have to come up with a compromise for the stakes where each stake is resolved and ALL the setting and character elements are used. Both times we had ties it was a high octane moment, where opposing stakes were made to interact.<br/><br/>With more people, ties would become less common, and that would be sad.<br/><br/>I hope this made even vague sense.                        </div>

                            Yes, if you are playing tactically, you can choose 4567890123 as your sequence and pick off both ends to get to the explosive middle stuff.  IIRC Remi chose 0123456789 and was restricted in the elements he introduced because he wanted to save those big numbers.  Having two choices per scene is a satisfying constraint.  <br/><br/>I have not done the math but I think everyone wins an equal amount in a two player game.  Which is cool and fun.  <br/><br/>Early on Remi introduced the element "mint chewing gum", which seemed pretty innocuous, and also on the table was "rival circus".  So we had these mysterious dudes hanging around, obvious circus folk, and they were chewing strong-scented mint gum.  Why?  TO MASK THE SMELL OF DECAY.                        </div>
