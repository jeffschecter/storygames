We are organizing a game jam in the Seattle area. So first of all, stay tuned for info if you are in the area and want to participate. <br/><br/>And second of all, we would be happy (and eager) to recieve any helpful hints. None of the folks organizing this have ever done this kind of thing before (I don\u2019t think...). <br/><br/>We are a playtest group that works on gmLess and gmed games. Mostly one shots or short arcs. <br/><br/>Our goal is to lower the bar for entry into the world of game design for people who might be interested but haven\u2019t gotten over the hump and tried yet. <br/><br/>One thing we are looking for is a list of game mechanisms etc. we are hoping to provide something like a toolkit, or maybe a heap of spare parts that people can use to get started in the game design process. <br/><br/>Any other helpful hints or materials are also more than welcome. <br/><br/>We are all ears!<br/><br/>Thanks very much,<br/>Davey. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471090/#Comment_471090" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-24T21:35:45+00:00" title="March 24, 2018  9:35PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A good project!<br/><br/>I'm not sure how helpful just throwing list of tools and resources at people is (and it may produce wrong inclinations towards the design process), but you might want to look up "Design Patterns in Successful Rileplaying Games".

I was going to start writing about safety, the importance of a clear structure of play and initiative order, and how to create a <i>safe</i> and <i>creative</i> environment, but this document says most of it in the headlines Principles and Environment.  <br/><a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/playWithIntent_newLayout.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://erebaltor.se/rickard/playWithIntent_newLayout.pdf</a><br/><br/><b>Improv glossary</b><br/>Accept, Block+Offer, and even Status, are incredibly important.<br/><a href="https://improwiki.com/en/wiki/improv/special/category/90/improv-glossary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://improwiki.com/en/wiki/improv/special/category/90/improv-glossary</a><br/><br/><b>MDA</b><br/>A formal approach to game design.<br/><a href="http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/</a><br/><br/><b>Daniel Cook's blog</b><br/>Everything on his site is a should read by game designers, but this one in particular. In order to create a game - something that creates an interaction and, for collaborative storytelling games, an interaction/conversation between the participants - they need to create a feedback loop. That's how they get invested in the game/story.<br/><a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/10/what-are-game-mechanics.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/10/what-are-game-mechanics.html</a><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Active listening is really important in collaborative storytelling games, where the participants that doesn't have characters involved in the scene/situation still wants to listen. You do that by having them affect the outcome, throw in new stuff in the scene, or assist the participants.<br/><br/><b>The Murder of Mr. Crow</b> does that by the Assistant, where the Detective can, at any time, ask the assistant for help if the person gets stuck.<br/><br/><b>Zombie Cinema</b> and <b>Nostalgia</b> lets non-participants vote on which one they will prefer to win.<br/><br/><b>Svart av kval, vit av lust</b> does hard suggestions of what the characters in the scene must do, or resist doing.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco</b> lets the non-participants either start the scene or decide the outcome of the scene.<br/><br/><b>Archipelago</b> uses ritual words to steer how someone else describes things.<br/><br/><b>Once Upon a Time</b> forces others to listen if they want to continue the story, and also have trigger words that can make a participant to take over the word.<br/><br/><b>Baron M\xfcnchhausen</b> and <b>Nostalgia</b> lets the participants that are not storytelling suggest challenges for the storyteller.<br/><br/><b>The Coyotes of Chicago</b> only have one character, but the rest are game masters with their own agenda, so they need to listen to what the other says to incorporate their own agenda with the others.<br/><br/><b>Imagine</b> lets everyone participate by saying a sentence, and they need to listen to actively put the sentences together to form a story.<br/><br/>In game master driven games, the game master must do active listening to be able to plan ahead (the game master is always participating by responding to the players' actions, but plan ahead is different).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>By making this list of active listening mechanics above, I would like to throw in a thought that listing mechanics only blocking the creativity, instead of offering new insights. I would rather see a checklist of things to include to make a successful collaborative storytelling game, like safe environment for the participants, active listening, and feedback loops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471112/#Comment_471112" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-25T15:47:12+00:00" title="March 25, 2018  3:47PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Super feedback!

(And, as a bonus, if a coin flip feels just right, you just saved yourself a lot of headache!)<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
