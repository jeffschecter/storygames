Damn it.Lost mah post.<br/>Anyway - before we talk about how to change or design games according to our social goals, it may be helpful to discuss what those goals <i>are</i>.<br/>Me, I am all about this sort of play:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>The games you play with friends to explore each other or go through an experience together<br/></blockquote> This is why I like games with sexual, unusual, or otherwise "edgy" content - it makes us all "go places" together, or at least push our boundaries a bit. <br/>As I see it, \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>The games you play with friends to just hang around<br/></blockquote> is kind of opposed to the "explore-each-other" agenda - and, sadly, it's a goal I almost never embrace. When I sit down to game, that's all I want to do. <br/><br/>Quick design consideration: Polaris has a procedure for handling interpersonal conflict (as opposed to player-v-player, in-game conflict): if things get heated, stop the game and talk about it. If you can't get back to a head-space where you're up for playing, then stop Polaris for the night and do something else. <br/>I think this is sort of the flip-side of tackling a social agenda - giving procedural text that tackles problems related to a potentially toxic or dysfunctional disagreement at the table. And, just so it's clear, I don't think anybody should have to put up with argument at the game table - it is not fucking worth it. <br/><br/>Cool!

That's basically what separates tabletop from video RPGs, right?  (I mean, there's a creativity gap too, but there's nothing to stop you from writing backstory for your WoW characters.  The reason you don't is that you don't get to share them socially.)<br/><br/>To pick a random example, division of responsibilities does a ton socially.  Games with turns can help get to know everyone at the table at least a little.  Games where the GM does most of the thinking and everyone else chimes in or not as inspired are great for chillin' with friends.  Games where everyone has to provide adversity for someone else's character can do the emo bonding thing well.  The same holds true for apportioning authorities, handling resolution mechanics, situation generation, and just about any game procedure I can think of.<br/><br/>Can you narrow down your question at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306194/#Comment_306194" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T05:07:48+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  5:07AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Can you narrow down your question at all?</blockquote>OK, so I'll make it specific to a game, city, and 3 stages of transition.  <br/><br/>So, in Toronto, like I imagine a lot of cities, the gaming tends to come about around a GM with a vision for a game.

The Battlebabe is the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> in the Hocus's cult, which depends on the Chopper's raids for food.  The goal: Help people care about other PCs with in-fiction incentives on top of the social/creative ones which may take longer to evolve.  2) More coercion.  Steal the stuff and NPCs they care about, bring Threats into play quickly.  The goal: Make sure the players have somethign to do and a strong stake in doing it ASAP.\n<blockquote>What do you change when you've decided you like playing with them and really want to hook them?</blockquote>I'd discuss what people want to see in the game.  By this point, hopefully everyone will have ideas, feel confident in expressing them, and care enough to listen to others.  I'd try to form a consensus that would shape my creation and use of Fronts and Threats going forward.  I'd also iron out any social glitches, like comedic asides, phone checking, talking over each other, etc.  \n<blockquote>What do you change when people become more comfortable and want to roll up their sleeves?</blockquote>Prep less, and support whatever the players are interested in on the fly.  it's their show now.  Push the limit of what we've agreed is fun -- character death, icky sex, plagues, nukes, etc.<br/><br/>This is pretty much how I prefer to approach campaigns in any game I run.  But it seems suited to AW.  Not sure how well I covered your original "just to hang out" and "explore each other" social agendas from the opening post.  For the former, I'd create cool secrets for the players to uncover; for the latter, I'd use Fronts and Threats closer to the players' real lives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307001/#Comment_307001" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T15:27:39+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  3:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Upon review, that last response is like drinking scotch.
