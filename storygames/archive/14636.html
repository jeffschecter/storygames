It was awesome! Even though the players made some not entirely serious characters, it was a fun game and the tower managed to make things tense. Coming from a D&amp;D background the players were pretty combat-focused, but that lead to some interesting moments like the terror one character experienced as he beat a wolf to death with a metal pizza tray just screaming over and over "Please die....please...."<br/><br/>Anyways, one thing I did was when the lights went out in the game I turned out the lights in the room. This wadded great ambiance and a bit more challenge. Seeing as the characters were high school students they reasoned they all had cell phones in game, so I let them use their phones as lights. It added a great touch, and I'm eager to play again.<br/><br/>So, has anyone else come up with or tried any tricks like that in Dread? It doesn't have to be something you did out of game, but I'd just like to hear some general cool Dread stories and tricks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ODDin" title="ODDin"><img alt="ODDin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ODDin">ODDin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333065/#Comment_333065" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T12:56:53+00:00" title="July  4, 2011 12:56PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, playing around with the lighting can be a great thing for horror games, Dread or otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333083/#Comment_333083" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T15:25:33+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  3:25PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!

When pulls needed to be made, a separate player would hold a small flashlight on the tower. This lead to an interesting trust mechanic in the Berlin spies game, where you had to pick who was going to hold the light for you and hope they didn't turn it off inappropriately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333138/#Comment_333138" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-05T07:44:34+00:00" title="July  5, 2011  7:44AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2011 7:45AM by Epidiah_Ravachol.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The very first Dread game was played at a kitchen table, in the dark of night, lit only by candle and far away street lamp. In a neighboring room we had a computer playing the spookiest soundtrack of MP3s we could scrap together (this was back when folks had to scour their CD or Compact Disc collection in order to find music). The playlist was random and included this song by Samhain: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCHtORtLUuo" rel="nofollow">"Misery's Tomb"</a> via a <b>Not Entirely Safe For Work</b> YouTube link. 30 seconds of essentially silence (thanks to shitty speakers and the distance between us and the computer) followed by anguished moaning. That will seriously mess a player up when they are pulling. It got so every time some one stepped up, they would wait for the next song to begin, just in case the current one would end when they weren't paying attention and "Misery's Tomb" would pop up unannounced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
