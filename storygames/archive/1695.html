                    (This discussion is specifically about gender and it's intertwining with games qua games; if this has been hashed already in an older thread, please just post a link to same and tell me to move along... 8))<br/><br/>I recently read <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2006/08/cant_leave_well.html" rel="nofollow">this thread on 20x20 room</a> that started scratching the surface about gender assumptions and agenda in "The Prince's Kingdom". Judd had (at time of writing) the last word in the thread, and had this (amongst other points) to say:
<blockquote><br/>But he wrote a game about growing up a boy and turning into a man. It is what he knew.<br/></blockquote>
Now, I get that TPK narratively "assumes" that all the player roles are "little princes" and that they are strategically directed in their efforts by their "father" who is the "king".<br/><br/>However, I don't at all get that TPK <i>mechanically</i> makes these assumptions at all.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem to me out of the way to make all the player roles "little princesses" (even the sons of the parent are called "princesses"). Neither does it seem out of the way for the parent to be a Queen instead of a King. Or to have the players decide what their title will be, and what the gender of their parent is.<br/><br/>I don't really see that the genders involved have a fundamental effect on the narrative mission of the players, or the mechanical effect of playing out that mission:<br/><br/><i>What do the player characters do?</i>: Travel their parent's realm to solve problems and learn how to be a ruler themselves.<br/><br/><i>What do the players do?</i>: Explore themes of conflict resolution and leadership by having their characters placed into situations where their authority and responsibilities may far outstrip their current resources.<br/><br/>Gender may, in fact, play a role in this game -- how do players conceptions of gender get drawn out in their portrayals? What do the players think consitutes conflict and resolution and leadership as informed by gender?<br/><br/>But what I don't see is how "the game is about growing up a boy and turning into a man", necessarily. It <i>could</i> be about that, but by the same token I see no reason why the game (pretty much as written, mechanically) couldn't be about "growing up a girl and turning into a woman", or "growing up a child and turning into a monarch (or, more generically, leader)".<br/><br/>Specifically -- anyone have thoughts on how gender intertwines with the <i>game</i> present in "The Princes' Kingdom"? How does this interaction of gender in TPK differ from Dogs In The Vineyard, its parent game? (From my point of  view, DitV brings issues of gender much more to the fore, given that gender roles in the game's default background seem to have much more overt <i>in-game</i> effects with respect to character expecations and what characters "should and should not be doing".)<br/><br/>Generally -- anyone have thoughts about how gender intertwines with the <i>game</i> in a variety of other rolegames? (If TPK is not, or couldn't be, a game about "growing up a girl and turning into a woman", in your opinion, what game is or could be?)                </div>

I completely agree; I have only a smattering of expertise in this area, so, for my part, I pledge to tread carefully. One of the things I'm interested in is the <i>performative</i> nature of rolegames and notions of deep play. How do rolegamers perform (and performing, self-construct or demolish) notions of identity and gender. I realize this is a huge topic, and I only intended to bite off a small nibble with this thread.
<blockquote><br/>One thing that Dogs and by extension TPK is actually really bad at is building consensus, which is purportedly one of the primary tools in the feminine conflict resolution toolkit.

Really? OK, I may need to come back after some actual play; by my reading of the mechanics of both games, the methodology of raising and seeing (and specifically, the qualitative degrees of seeing) leads, <i>perforce</i> to compromise. When someone takes the blow, or blocks, the protagonist must compromise to some degree: changing the stakes, adjusting to the new playing field, stepping askew, <i>bring something new to the stakes table</i>. Is this not borne out through actual play? This is certainly how the games <i>read</i> to me, and are key components of what I expect to encounter when I do play them.
<blockquote><br/>If you wanted a feminine version of TPK supporting consensus-building, you'd have your princesses go out to the various islands, get to know the denizens, and construct a solution that everyone can feel a part of -- and have the mechanics support that.<br/></blockquote>
I'm not sure that I buy this characterization of consensus solutions as "feminine", but I do agree that this might be perceived as a common notion of "femininity". I'd be interested in seeing how the game supports players exploring the concepts of struggle, maturation, and soltuions-building from a gendered point of view (what do players with princess characters think are appropriate approaches to struggle? what stakes do they put on the table, and how do they compromise when the rubber hits the road?)
<blockquote><br/>So each island would be a sort of people-collection exercise, with players using the system to put the denizens on their character sheet, making overtures to get them to buy in, and (very importantly)<em>modifying the players' proposed solution</em>so that as many people as possible could buy into it (and buy into it willingly, not coerced by means of authority).</blockquote>
Isn't the entire mechanism of raise-and-see and fallout designed to do precisely what you're describing here? This is what I expected from reading these games; am I to discover in actual play that this is <i>not</i> how the games will proceed? That raise-and-see will not result in explorations of solution-building through compromise? (In Dogs In The Vineyard, it seems that the game is much more about the corruption of power and proper application of authority: when, under what circumstances, and how often, will the Dogs resort to their ultimate authority of The Gun and Religious Authority? Princes Kingdom seemed to me more about how do you learn to be wise when you have responsibility, authority, and no resources; learning to be wise I equate with promoting compromise as solution-building.)                        </div>

                            Viktor, I think that is one way to use Taking the Blow, but it is one of many.  You could just as easily Take the Blow by being embarassed, or distracted, or flustered, and so on.  So you can very easily insist on getting your way, without modification, and all of the blows you take being speedbumps along the way.  Using compromise is not prominent enough for me to really see any <em>equivalence</em> between Taking the Blow and Compromise.<br/><br/>Now, if you reframed Taking the Blow <em>as</em> compromising and not the other dodges, then you might be cooking with gas.                        </div>

Thanks for your feedback, Joshua; I'll have to experience in actual play how the raise-and-see engine works to interact with a dynamic sense of stakes-setting. I was expecting to see the stakes not be static, but essentially negotiated as struggles progress, re-framed based on the performance of the people involved. In this respect the meta-struggle becomes: what choices are the players willing to commit to (and live with) to reframe stakes in their favour, and indeed, what do they construe as "favourable" to them? The resolution of that commitment comes back to them via the fallout mechanism.<br/><br/>If this turns out not to be the case, then I may be less enthusiastic about these games, but we shall see.<br/><br/>With respect to gender, I was anticipating that Princes' Kingdom was going to be about children learning to be wise (and perhaps also having a stake in determining what it might mean to be a wise man or wise woman or wise something else, through their committed choices during struggles and the acceptance of ensuing fallout); it was for this reason that I was confused as to how this game was exclusively a game about "boys becoming adult sons of a wise father" -- I could see that subtext provided for in the game's narration (i.e. it's "story" or "setting"), but I could not really see it borne out in the game's "game-ness" (or performative potential).<br/><br/>Actual play will go a long way to me exploring these issues: but I'm still interested in what others observe about these matters.<br/><br/>Most specifically, I'd like to see comments on the question of "if this game can only be about boys learning to become men, then which games are about girls learning to become women"...                        </div>

IMHO you're confused because the game isn't really about that. There's no value of growth the game promotes that I, for example, wouldn't want for my daughter. I'd be surprised if there are parents of girls who would say differently.<br/><br/>While TPK is derived from DITV, there's no truly useful sense in which "Both Princes' Kingdom and Dogs in the Vineyard do _X_ with gender." DITV provides a setting that consciously, productively shoves gender issues embedded in a culture in the play group's face and says, Go on, deal with it. TPK simply fails to have a text that is welcoming to girls who might read it. There's nothing about the game or the setting that girls would enjoy less than boys, summing over all girls and all boys. Girls might like it <em>better</em>, actually, but that's the sort of thing that only playtesting the game with lots of actual children of both genders would answer definitively.<br/><br/>The action of TPK is making communities work again when they've stopped working.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </div>

                            OK, so Clinton is running TPK for us at Origins this year. He starts describing it, and one of the first things he says is something about how it's not just about Princes, but about Princesses as well. Not self-consciously, but as an off-hand remark. Basically it was something like how he couldn't get the title to fit both concepts or something.<br/>
<br/>
I won't say that there's not some things about the game that treat male and female characters differently in play. But I do think that if it's so, that my guess is that it's entirely unintentional, and that DitV would have to have those elements as well, then. What's more, in play, and looking at how lessons are created, I think that players are going to get out of it something informed by what they bring to it. Meaning that it'll play differently for male and female players.<br/>
<br/>
As do all RPGs.<br/>

                            In the game of TPK we played at GenCon, we had two princes and two princesses, played by Emily (Prince), Joe (Prince), Ben (Princess) and me (Princess).

What other than hearsay or stereotyping suggests that women are more adapted to consensus-building? I would be very cautious with that kind of statement. <br/><br/>It wouldn't necessarily equate with my experience of women in leadership or team roles in business either.                        </div>

                            Ian, that's why I included the first line:

                            Jim - No I haven't yet played TPK with the boys, but with time-change bringing darker evenings, it will happen soon, I expect. 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>Gender may, in fact, play a role in this game -- how do players conceptions of gender get drawn out in their portrayals? What do the players think consitutes conflict and resolution and leadership as informed by gender?<br/><br/>But what I don't see is how "the game is about growing up a boy and turning into a man", necessarily. It<i>could</i>be about that, but by the same token I see no reason why the game (pretty much as written, mechanically) couldn't be about "growing up a girl and turning into a woman", or "growing up a child and turning into a monarch (or, more generically, leader)".</blockquote>
I think it's worth noting that when Clinton made TPK, he was doing it to celebrate Vincent's impending fatherhood of a third son. *Of course* it's about learning to be a good man, and by extension a good father, because it was a very personal work. That's not all it is, as you rightly note in the second half ofthe above quote. There's room in the gaming world for games that are about something in the real world, that also wind up as good games - look at Breaking the Ice (starting a realationship) and It was a Mutual Decision (ending one). To decry TPK as somehow sexist seems short-sighted to me.                        </div>
