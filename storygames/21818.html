I think you make a solid argument for why social media is not naturally suited for organizing, but I'm not sure why people haven't found ways to organize regardless.  To me this smells like an issue of modern American culture, but maybe the same issues of platform apply.  I'm really interested to see if we'll get better at this -- I don't see why a "make D&amp;D refuse to work with abusers in the future" Kickstarter or GoFundMe or something couldn't be effectively promoted on social media, for example.

They might live in a community but they aren't a community and can't form the basis for one. There's a reason that there's no "community initiative" type of website or app and that reason is because doing so would threaten any revenue stream that might develop. The history of the Internet is one in which communities are repeatedly targeted by monied interests and eliminated one by one. To an Internet entrepreneur, a community is a thing that can be sold to Facebook. <br/><br/>Organizing is not easy and it can fail. You can't fail to post your opinion on social media. So social media is more attractive, and nothing will happen. Hail Satan.<br/><br/>As far as Story Hyphen Games Dot Com goes, I think there are times when perhaps everyone or nearly everyone has the same goal, usually the improvement of play of tabletop RPGs. (This is one reason it's never been any good for designers talking about design. Alternately, when it's good for designers talking about design it's not good for people trying to improve their play.)<br/><br/>Structurally, which is the chief point of my post, an enthusiast web forum is a more conducive environment to community than social media. But even a web forum can sell ad space, and once there's a crack in the dam, there's a lot of water pushing at it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477069/#Comment_477069" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-14T22:30:28+00:00" title="October 14, 2018 10:30PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That blog post is spot-on                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477086/#Comment_477086" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-15T17:14:42+00:00" title="October 15, 2018  5:14PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2018 5:15PM by Airk.">edited October 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I mean, it's a community if you use that word very loosely.  <br/>It's not a community I would want to help me raise a barn.  <br/>But, I mean, people have raised money for people.  <br/>It's a shame much of the good is money instead of acts.

The reason they aren't is because, as described, the social media entities and the publishers and all the other powers of the market have redefined criticism to be about personal preferences (when it's not about personal attacks), since that's what's important to them. But criticism, even in this specific example, can serve alternate causes than getting a publisher to change their mind!<br/><br/>Wo maybe that's one thing that could be actually done but i'm not sure if it would work.<br/><br/>The very idea of a sustained critical approach to something like d&amp;d 5 doesn't exist in any form except for like, ppls direct engagements with trying to make the game work well on places like this.

Fan fiction, for example, existed before the Internet of course, but many communities around its creation have blossomed.  Note that the purpose of these communities is something <i>other</i> than commercial preferences - they exist to promote the form, to promote fan fiction of a particular type, to critique and improve fan fiction, to encourage fan writers, and so on.  <br/><br/>(And where do fan fiction communities go wrong? When, instead of responding to the commercial production, they start to feel that they own it, that they are entitled to the source material to be a particular way - when they start to try to make their communities about their commercial preferences rather than their creative process.)<br/><br/>Certainly there <i>could be</i> an organization which could try to achieve some political or moral goal in the field of tabletop RPGs. And I even will grudgingly admit - if you really press me - that social media could play some role in the operation of such an organization.  But it wouldn't look anything like what we have now, which is a sequence of overlapping personal broadcasts of individual preferences. And it wouldn't, I have to emphasize this, it wouldn't be a bunch of friends who like each other or who like each other's games, or even a particular type of game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477139/#Comment_477139" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-20T08:03:55+00:00" title="October 20, 2018  8:03AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't understand much of this. It seems there are a few main themes. One theme is about the definition of the word "community". That the way most people use that word is wrong? I'm not a native speaker, so obviously I'm not an authority, but looking up definitions, I get things like "a social, religious, occupational, or other group sharing common characteristics or interests and perceived or perceiving itself as distinct in some respect from the larger society within which it exists (usually preceded by the)". That seems to apply pretty well to RPG players. It's of course fine to argue that we should all use a word differently, to mean a different thing, but it's rarely effective.<br/><br/>The other part seems to be that social media is horrible in some respect, though I'm not sure I understand the problem here, either. I'm an outsider again, since I haven't tried social media, so perhaps it makes more sense to people who have.<br/><br/>Then there's the D&amp;D controversy. I haven't heard of this before, but these things happen from time to time. It seems to me that the thing about it all being driven by money means that people have lots of possibilities to affect. If you don't like what Wizards are doing, you don't give them money, and if enough people don't like it, Wizards will either have to change it or get financial problems. And if the problem is that you don't like that others like it, well, I must admit my response is mostly "well, too bad".<br/><br/>So, it's no wonder I'm confused, I guess. I'm a non-native English speaker who's never used social media and don't know about the D&amp;D controversy, who's reading a blog post about the definition of an English word, how horrible social media is, and about the D&amp;D controversy. I guess I'll just shrug and move on, but at any rate, it was an interesting read and an image into a world (or a community?) that I wasn't familiar with before.

The problem is not all-consuming and doesn't encompass you. Ignore everything I said.<br/><br/>As far as an illusion of righteousness, again, I feel I must emphasize this, <i>don't blame the victims</i> here. There's nothing wrong with taking a political or moral stand on an event in the hobby. There's nothing wrong with organizing to accomplish a political or moral goal. And there's a billion dollars a year screaming in people's ear that they can effect moral change if they only share their commercial preferences just a little bit louder and a little bit more often. To say I'm simply observing people embracing an "illusion of righteousness" erases the hucksters who are frantically selling them that illusion in increasingly aggressive and threatening ways. Even your grandmother is on Facebook now. (Facebook would prefer you relate to each other as fellow consumers, of course, and stop loving her, if you can.) <br/><br/>Simon alleges: "If you don't like what Wizards are doing, you don't give them money, and if enough people don't like it, Wizards will either have to change it or get financial problems." But boycotts simply do not happen that way. Not historically, not now, and never in the future. There must be something more than just shrugging your shoulders and walking away if you hope to accomplish a political or moral goal. But sharing your preference <i>is</i> enough for social media success! In fact, it's been intentionally constructed to reward that more than anything else. That's why the people who thought WOTC had done a wicked thing came away sickened and unsatisfied. Because they did what they had been directly and repeatedly told was sufficient to "support the community" and it accomplished not a single thing.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D consultants controversy was only one of the many, many examples of moral and political paroxysms that shake the "online RPG players community" routinely. But they all share the same outcome: absolutely nothing whatsoever. The point of my post is that this is by design - not by the design of RPG players, but by the design of those that control the communications channels they operate in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477151/#Comment_477151" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-22T06:08:31+00:00" title="October 22, 2018  6:08AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Might be that we are coming at it from different political backgrounds?</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's probably it.
