It's a nice physical product; the rules seem easy to get into; it looks like it might be slow, experiential and dramatic. (Of course, I haven't played it, so it might be a complete disaster - but AP reports seem positive, as far as I can tell).<br/><br/>Has anyone tried using Spotify playlists instead of CDs?

I don't understand how it works, and based on the rules I don't think it should work.  But it does, beautifully.  I'd also add the word "internal" to your list of adjectives -- it's a game that really encourages introspection and interior journeys.<br/><br/>As far as Spotify goes, I think it would be a tradeoff.  <br/><br/>It would reduce the equipment required to a computer with decent speakers and an Internet connection.  And in this day and age even CDs seem quaint artifacts of a bygone age.<br/><br/>But at the same time you'd be limiting the music to Spotify's catalog.  Eight million songs sounds like a lot, until they don't have the *perfect* song that you want to put in the playlist, or you find that the group you want a song from hasn't signed with them yet. And things like imports, EPs, and bootlegs are unlikely to ever be available.  You'd also have to either have every participant have a Spotify account, or have one person play coordinator and make up the playlists.<br/><br/>It also depends on your group's tastes in music - I'm reacting to this as a fan of indie music, which is fairly poorly served by the mainstream online music sites.  (Of course, I understand why this happens, and if I were an iTunes decisionmaker I'd probably decide the same thing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283658/#Comment_283658" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T07:57:15+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  7:57AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>ut at the same time you'd be limiting the music to Spotify's catalog.

That and losing the tactile component of changing CDs, which I think is neat.<br/><br/>But as long as you can make a mix ahead of time, and fit those thematic requirements, you're golden.<br/><br/>I'm wondering how you'd do a game via Skype. Could you make a playlist on Spotify or Pandora and stream it to your friends in real time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283708/#Comment_283708" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T11:34:05+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 11:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            you're also missing the key fun of being able to play the game ON THE ROAD. <br/><br/>But far be it from me to tell you how to play.
