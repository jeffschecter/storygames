I've run rpgs for years and never once felt any one of my players was "under" me, or that I had any greater status at the table than they did. Sure, I was running the games, but I wasn't lording it over anyone. I've been a player in just as many games and never felt that I was playing "under" the GM.<br/><br/>Anyway, the idea of a crew of players feeling they are "under" a GM strikes me as a very passive attitude, and one that assumes all fun, knowledge, and responsibility is to be doled out by the GM, and the players should be grateful that they are allowed to attend the presence of a True Game Master (who will now tell a Story for all to enjoy). Blech!<br/><br/>"He's the most creative GM I've ever played under."  Whoo! Really rubs me the wrong way, that does....<br/><br/>OK, got that off my chest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82141/#Comment_82141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T19:10:57+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  7:10PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really think that's just a commonly used phrase and doesn't necessarily mean the other participants are passive.<br/><br/>Additionally, I think playing "under" and "with", as you are distinguishing them, are equally valid ways to play RPGs.

I've heard "playing with" quite a bit.<br/><br/>The closest I've heard to this diabolical "under" is if Fred was GMing a GURPS Fantasy game, people might say "I'm playing in Fred's game."  Although honestly, they're just as likely to say "our GURPS Fantasy game," depending on the context of the statement and what point they were trying to make.  After all, it <i>is</i> Fred's game, because he's putting in a lot of effort to run it, and he's probably hosting it at his home, too; and at the same time it's <i>our</i> game, because we're all playing it.<br/><br/><br/>Maybe you're just looking at some kind of regional slang, the way Californians say "coke" when they mean any carbonated sugared cola-like beverage, or people in the South say "y'all" when they mean "you."  Where folks around here say "I play in so-in-so's game," the gamers in another neck of the woods might say "I play this game under so-and-so," and you're just imagining it's symbolic of some vast social inequity because that's what you want to see.  <br/><br/>Besides, unless you're actually looking at their games while they're playing them, you can't really say that the "under" crowd isn't playing exactly the same way that the "with" people do.  Assuming there's a difference entirely on the basis of a single word doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82272/#Comment_82272" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T10:18:26+00:00" title="July 19, 2007 10:18AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2007 10:21AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>he way Californians say "coke" when they mean any carbonated sugared cola-like beverage</blockquote>\nWe do?

Weird.</blockquote>Me neither.<br/><br/>As for "X's game/campaign", I'm used to using it alongside of "our game/campaign", but it's always understood that X is the GM. I wouldn't say "My <i>Mekton</i> campaign" if I was a player rather than GM. Why? Well, the work, hosting, etc., are all part of it, but I think it's mainly because the GM is seen as indispensible to the campaign's continuity...even if it's a completely flimsy make-up-the-details-as-you-go gameworld. If a player drops out of a game, I think the norm is to retire the character or run it as an NPC. If a GM drops out, the campaign's over (with few exceptions). You don't usually slot in a new GM while keeping the same player-characters.<br/><br/>Obviously troupe-style play changes all this but I don't think it's especially common.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82323/#Comment_82323" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T13:58:08+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  1:58PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I say "My GM" the same way I say "My cat", and it's just as accurate...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_82374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82374/#Comment_82374" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-19T17:37:21+00:00" title="July 19, 2007  5:37PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2007 5:40PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>he way Californians say "coke" when they mean any carbonated sugared cola-like beverage</blockquote>\nWe do?

Soda dominates in California. Coke is also popular because we've had a lot of people from the South move in in the middle of last century.

We do refer to specific game ownership, like "my Burning Empires game" or "Jerry's SLA game" or "Mike's Spirit of the Century game," but that's more of a label to differentiate between games and to identify the GM involved, since each GM has their own flavor that the players can enjoy -- kinda like "This game of Unknown Armies came from the RPG vineyard of Ryan Macklin," not "Ryan Macklin owns you for the next for hours, losers!  Hope you like Madness checks, cuz I got a bag full of 'em!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
