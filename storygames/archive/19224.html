How could a teenager derive more satisfaction from the purchase of a second-hand jalopy than a middle-aged executive acquiring their third luxury sports car?  Because happiness and satisfaction are associated with relative improvement, not absolute achievement.  As long as you are better off today than you were yesterday, by whatever measurement floats your particular boat, you\u2019ll feel good.<br/><br/>No, I haven\u2019t decided to branch out into a self-help blog.  I was just setting up being able to use a quote \u2013 \u2018In games, as in life\u2018.<br/><br/>An innate goal that players set for themselves in any game that allows it is to continually improve their situation.  Many games tap into this powerful urge by starting the player in a relatively uniform, weak or barely adequate state, and then offer opportunities for the player to make it more personalized, powerful or capable.  In Civilization, the aim of the game is to turn your little empire into a great one.  In Spelunky and Dungeon Bash, the player constantly strives to make their character or team more capable.<br/><br/>Look at Farmville.  A quick google, and many of the top results are articles sniffing that because its such a \u2018dumb game\u2019, it must be the \u2018power of social-networking\u2019 that is responsible for its phenomenal success.  Well sure, social-networking is a great way to promote awareness of the game and get people to give it a test-run, but the game itself must be doing something right to hold on to players for any significant time.  If you aren\u2019t familiar with Farmville, its basically Sim City lite.  The same basic gameplay as Sim City is going on, except the game itself is less complicated and very accessible to new players.  The thing that is going on is resource management decisions in pursuit of the goal of building the player\u2019s own little farm.  You start off with a certain amount of money, and you decide which crops to grow, and harvesting your crops gives you more money.  You can buy other stuff to personalize your farm, and tractors and things to make harvesting easier, etc\u2026  As games go, it\u2019s fairly shallow \u2013 the variety and depth of the decisions the player makes is limited.  As long as the player tends to their farm frequently enough, it\u2019s existence is never threatened.  But regardless, it does allow the player to make decisions in pursuit of the goal of continual improvement and that\u2019s enough.  Without that basic thing going on, no other amount of social-networking stuff laid on top would get anyone to play it for very long.<br/><br/>Minecraft is an example of this goal used in it\u2019s purest form.  In this game you start with a pick-axe and a few other resources, and you can literally end up building the Taj Mahal.  This game has two modes: survival mode in which your resources are limited and the existence of your character is threatened by monsters and environmental hazards, and creative mode, where you have infinite resources, super powers, and nothing to worry about except what to build.  My exhaustive research (I googled it and clicked on the first three links) shows that survival mode is more popular.  Survival mode takes the improvement goal and combines it with some consequential decision making and thus makes a game of it.  Creative mode does not.<br/><br/>So.  The pursuit of improvement is probably the most important goal a game can facilitate.  Many successful games don\u2019t use it, but many, many, many successful games do, and for good reason.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428353/#Comment_428353" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T15:43:00+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  3:43PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2014 3:44PM by catty_big.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting post. As a 'dirty hippie' game designer my natural inclination, when I see game objectives being boiled down to 'helping characters succeed and improve their lot', is to turn that on its head and design a game where the PCs are already fairly high up in their society, but need to fight to retain their position, and avoid falling down an exponentially slippery slope. In fact, my planned 20s themed game Disgraceful kinda does this, as during the game the characters have to avoid the many temptations that Jazz Age Hollywood has to offer, and retain their moral compass.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir" title="AlbeyAmakiir"><img alt="AlbeyAmakiir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/139/nCE1BSIBJZEBM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir">AlbeyAmakiir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428355/#Comment_428355" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T16:25:17+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  4:25PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd argue Farmville is only doing something "right" in the same way a con-man is.<br/><br/>On topic, though, I'm on board with catty. If you ever identify a common thread in gaming, the next thing to do would be to flip it and see if you can still get it to work. I'd say this is just one thing many games have, not a necessary component at all, and there are certainly games that don't use it, or even use the opposite (RPGs or otherwise).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428356/#Comment_428356" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T16:59:07+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  4:59PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Iv'e not played Fiasco, but I gather its a game that is explicit about working against your character's best interests?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428357/#Comment_428357" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T17:09:04+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  5:09PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2014 5:16PM by catty_big.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd argue Farmville is only doing something "right" in the same way a con-man is.</blockquote>\nThis is similar to the concept of bestsellers, which are usually execrable in purely literary terms, but have enough crowd-pleasing elements, in fact are usually consciously constructed using those elements.

So pursuit of improvement is an implicit goal discovered by the participants during the game?<br/><br/>My answer to my question would be that improvement is about achieving mastery of the game. Learning mastery is why a game is fun, according to Raph Koster's <a href="http://www.theoryoffun.com/resources.shtml" rel="nofollow">Theory of Fun</a>. When you achieved mastery, the task will be boring, according to Mih\xe1ly Cs\xedkszentmih\xe1lyi's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29#Conditions_for_flow" rel="nofollow">flow theory</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Evaluation_Theory" rel="nofollow">Cognitive Evaluation Theory</a> says that intrinsic reward is partly about competence.<br/><br/>The other part of CET is autonomy (self-expression) and I think that's also what Farmville brings. I think it wouldn't have had the same impact if you couldn't share your results with friends. "You can buy other stuff to personalize your farm," is also about expressing yourself.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Anyway, your answer is interesting because I've been wondering what creates a goal in a game.

They all stem from the same urge.  <br/><br/>My gut feel that all those theorists you reference above are referring to the same thing - improvement, or a  better term I just came across - progression.  The quote from my post is the best way I can explain it "<i>Because happiness and satisfaction are associated with relative improvement, not absolute achievement. As long as you are better off today than you were yesterday, by whatever measurement floats your particular boat, you\u2019ll feel good</i>."<br/><br/>So yeah, when you have plateaued, either because the task has become too easy (mastery - nowhere else to go) or too hard (getting nowhere) then the fun stops.  We've all given up on things because we stopped improving.<br/><br/>Can you elaborate on your goal question a bit?   I mean, a goal is a goal, right?  Something you want to achieve.
