My main worry is that it seems really long for a convention game, in terms of the number of obstacles. In my experience running Mouse Guard, we often get through 1 conflict and a handful of obstacles (say 3-4 max, combining ones created by the GM and ones the players ask to attempt) in a single session, with time for a player turn at the end if they're lucky (otherwise, we have to do it at the start of the next session).<br/><br/>Right now I see:<br/><br/>A. Pass out characters<br/>B. Go over premise / stuff on sheet<br/>C. Intro/ Mission Briefing<br/>1. Fire obstacle<br/>2. Mice on the road obstacle, which could become 3. fight conflict<br/>4. Possible player turn<br/>5. Wasps obstacle or wasps conflict<br/>6. Raiders obstacle or raiders conflict<br/>7. Flash flood obstacle<br/>D. Return to Lockhaven<br/><br/>So that's 7 possible obstacles/conflicts, and if any 2 of them don't work out (or even if they succeed but take too much time), Gwendolyn is dead? That's pretty harsh, even for Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>My instinct is to cut this whole thing in half, more or less, keeping the rest as possible complications.  I'd do roadblock or raiders but not both, since they're more or less the same. Likewise with flash flood and fire.<br/><br/>Then again, I'm not sure I'd try to shove two sessions worth of content into a single convention one-shot, but it's an interesting idea. Anyway, just my initial reaction.  I like most of the obstacles/conflicts themselves, except for flash flood, which seems a bit tacked-on and overkill, given how much they'll have already been through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388351/#Comment_388351" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T21:18:33+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  9:18PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree with J. Badarse adventure John! <b>Cutting it in half is a great idea</b>, in effect it gives you twice the options for each obstacle now, which you can choose appropraitely as it follows on from the fiction, or use as twists for failed rolls.  <br/><br/>Maybe make a reminder in the Obstacle sections to yourself to encourage trait play in the fiction to generate player checks. That way, If you feel like there will be lots of time 'left over', you can encourage all sorts of player authored shenanigans at Sprucetuck during the potential player turn. I mean, there <i></i><b>are </b>some juicy hooks in the mission!<br/><br/>I wouldn't compromise Gwendolyn's life so harshly, but maybe one of the mice's relationships?Mayhap a bee with a missive about Gwendolyn's / Relationship's condition is dispatched and the wasps target the bee? Or if one of the player's suffers the sick condition, you can advance it to 'fevered' on a subsequent complication, meaning that without the medicine they cannot be healed?<br/><br/>I love the wasp seige concept combined with the hot hot summer vibe.

The fictional effect is the loss of supplies, the mechanical effect is Injured / Hungry.

The player turn is the chance for the them to take control of the story and initiate things they're interested in. Having the GM set fictional penalties if they do it feels like crossing a line.

If you're trying to fit two turn cycles in four hours, maybe do a really short first GM's turn two simple obstacle's where failure gives conditions.

They'll only have one check anyway, so just play the turn as normal. But you can put whatever fictional wrap on it that you like. The fiction and rules are in service to each other.

Thanks again, this has been super helpful.<br/><br/>The Delay mechanic is fully explained up front.  Many obstacle failures will award Delays.  A final obstacle allows the patrol to make up for Delays as they race back to Lockhaven.<br/><br/>The outline is now:<br/><br/><b>GM1:</b> Wildfire obstacle<br/><b>GM1:</b> Ivydale quarantine obstacle<br/><br/><b>P1</b> @ Elmoss<br/><br/><b>GM2:</b> Elmoss refugee obstacle (marked Optional, will add time limit suggestions after Weds playtest)<br/><b>GM2:</b> Wasp nest conflict<br/><br/><b>P2:</b> @ Sprucetuck<br/><br/><b>GM3:</b> Race back to Lockhaven at Ob 2 + number of Delays (Health).  Not required if the party has suffered no Delays.<br/><br/>I'm also going to limit this one to three players to bring it in on time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388501/#Comment_388501" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T21:57:18+00:00" title="August 27, 2012  9:57PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Better!
