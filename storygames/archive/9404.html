Thanks for the links!<br><br>I really, really appreciate that the author does not redefine racism to mean "prejudice + power". They are clear about what they mean by racism and in instances where they want to discuss "prejudice + power", they call it that rather than rolling it all into one term. <br><br>Great tips for writers.<br><br/>I enjoy that they point out calling someone's actions racist, even if they are, is likely going to bring up defensiveness and it needs to be a topic that we can talk about openly, so we need better ways to broach the subject. It's not an attack. It's an opportunity to learn. But we have to recognize the baggage attached so we can talk openly and not swing the word around like a weapon.<br/><br/>That being said it is very American centric. It's written from a perspective of American privilege. White racism is not the predominant form of racism in most of the world. The world is much larger than America. And white in America doesn't mean what white means in other places. But the target audience seems to be science fiction and fiction writers. I don't know what percentage of these writers are American.

Moral people can act immorally out of ignorance. The act can be criticized without criticizing the totality of the person. I've seen people call other people ignorant about something as if it is an insult which leads to defensiveness which leads people to stop listening which means they stop learning. I don't think being ignorant about something is an insult. Everyone is ignorant about something. Probably most things! How could you not? There is too much to know and not enough time to experience it all. The best we can do is be open and share our experiences with each other. Which would only benefit from communicating in non aggressive ways that maintains openness. <br/><br/>I'm not aware of resources that cover writing tips to avoid racism in a larger sense beyond a US focus. But understanding racism in other places is probably a good first step. <br/><br/>These don't seem to be bad resources (I haven't read them all so I can't vouch for them concretely):<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism</a><br/><a href="http://www.globalissues.org/article/165/racism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.globalissues.org/article/165/racism</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Europe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Europe</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Asia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Asia</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_Middle_East" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_Middle_East</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Africa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Africa</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Racism_in_Australia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Racism_in_Australia</a><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_South_America" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_South_America</a><br/><br/>Racism within Greece for example rarely has to do with whiteness and more to do with reasons tied to history, blood lines, economy, religion, nationality, geographical location, anti-immigration, homogeny, and large groups vs. small groups ... that end up being mixed together and generalized till many people don't even remember why they are racist against someone else. Ultimately it helps to ask why you make certain decisions, in writing or any form of communication, be open to other perspectives and even if you don't agree with those perspectives try to see if there is something within them that you can learn from.

I am baffled as to what is annoying folks about this.<br/><br/>Wolfe said it was BS and he was angry because he was a white person who had faced racist discrimination; but Mohanraj wrote:\n<blockquote>There are small exceptions here and there, pockets of time and place where maybe being white is going to screw you over. Yes. But overwhelmingly, it goes the other way, and if you are one of the handful of white people who have experienced real racial discrimination, you should ask yourself whether bringing that up in the middle of a discussion about the overwhelming institutionalized racism against people of color is actually going to be helpful. And remember that because privilege is a smooth and invisible road, the vast majority of the time, you can\u2019t even see how privileged your road is, compared to the brown people standing next to you. That\u2019s not your fault; it\u2019s just the way it is.</blockquote>\nin other words she specifically accepted and validated the experiences Wolfe refers to, noting only that bringing them up in certain contexts might not be helpful...  and that the fact that it goes both ways doesn't change the fact that it goes one way overwhelmingly more than the other.<br/><br/>RE: "other oppressions don't erase your white privilege," that's no more nor less than saying that a black man still has male privilege and a straight black woman still has heterosexual privilege, and a black able-bodied lesbian still has whatever you're supposed to call the privilege that you never have to think about whether you're going to be able to get into a building in your wheelchair.  These things are orthogonal; they are all their own thing, similar in some ways, different in others, not reducible one to the other such that one cancels the other out.  They're also not a "who suffers more" contest.<br/><br/>I don't know, you guys really led me to expect Malcolm X and I went there and found Mister Rogers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208500/#Comment_208500" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T08:04:50+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  8:04AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does anyone know of a game writer who has written something like this or is thinking about this?<br/><br/>Also how could this article of discussion impact our game writing and marketing of games?<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/villum" title="villum"><img alt="villum" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/villum">villum</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208504/#Comment_208504" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T08:12:45+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  8:12AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There has been lots of talk about how not to do it (the Drow in Forgotten Realms are a common example), but i can't think of anything like what you're asking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing i could think of is to make sure members of minorities seem viable as player characters in games, which might, if the author is right, mean avoiding the "unspecified race" element, and actually talk in the game text about how members of minorities can be be played well if you make a little effort.
