Because now I'm a lockpicking character. That can pick locks. My conception of the character's completely changed: before I was a fighter, now I'm a <i>sneaky</i> fighter.<br/><br/>And then the second level of Lockpick. Because, actually, I know I'm just buying to pick the harder locks later in the game. There's no technical difference between picking a hard lock with Lockpick 75 and an easy one with Lockpick 25. But, for some reason, it's satisfying. Now I can pick <i>difficult</i> locks.<br/><br/>All the different skill choices are like a menu of exciting, fun things my character could do. For some reason, having constrained choices is more fun than, say, making up freeform Traits in Dogs. In Dogs, I can make up <i>anything</i>. But, here, I have to choose. Do I want to disarm bombs or pick locks?<br/><br/>The only problem, really, is that I <i>must</i> pick fighty skills. Otherwise the monsters kill me. And that feels, slightly, like the game's betraying me. It <i>told</i> me I could pick <i>any</i> of the skills. But <i>actually</i> there's some that I <i>need</i> to pick. And it didn't tell me that.<br/><br/>Perhaps I will get another level of Science, so I can hack more terminals.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185112/#Comment_185112" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-28T20:03:43+00:00" title="December 28, 2008  8:03PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was tinkering with this idea for CRPGs: Buying certain skills/attribuites gives you "Survival points", and you need to get so many "Survival Points" before the game'll recognize the character as valid.

Are you saying there are actually locks you must pick, or you're just using that as an example of what you find annoying in games.<br/><br/>What I get a blast out of in Fallout 3 is all the skills I <i>don't</i> have any real ability in. I really suck at shooting big guns. When I find a box full of missiles, I just grab the pack of cigarettes in the bottom and leave the rest. I suck at explosives. That doesn't stop me from pulling out a bunch of grenades, hucking them down the hall, and tossing frag mines all over the flow while I beat a hasty retreat, it just means I do it badly.<br/><br/>Done right, the skill list lets you define yourself while also giving you information about what you might be like in this world. It's like having a strong-willed father who wants you to become a preacher. You might and you might not, but there will definitely be a choice involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gladen" title="gladen"><img alt="gladen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gladen">gladen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185123/#Comment_185123" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T00:14:27+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 12:14AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depend son the system, a ssome with skill lists are fun and good for their inteded purpose.

With freeform traits, they'll <i>essentially</i> be used in the same way. Oh, sure, I can pick "I learned to shoot with my father" or "I understand how computers work", but they'll all be part of the same resolution system. When I'm faced with a door, I can shoot the lock off or hack the computer to get past. Either way will work.<br/><br/>With skill lists, I've got to make a choice, one that seals off options in the future. If I don't choose Lockpick, I won't be playing that Lockpicking minigame and there are doors <i>I will never get through</i>. But if I choose  Lockpick, and don't pick Speech, there are people I will never manage to persuade. I can't have everything. I've got to choose.<br/><br/>(Note, here, that there's effectively no option about choosing Fight skills. If I don't choose one of the Fight skills, I'll be killed by monsters, and the game will be rubbish. So I <i>must</i> choose some fighty skills: after that, I choose the more specialised skills.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185185/#Comment_185185" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T11:25:26+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 11:25AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>I like this.

CRPGs tend to allow for a lot of trial and error so if you go one way and are surprised by a trap and die you can always reload and go the other way to talk past a guard. In P&amp;P RPGs the GM is expected not to do that kind of thing (place traps unless you can find them etc.) unless you can handle it, which may lessen the effect of selecting one skill over another, since there won't be a trap there in the first place.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185218/#Comment_185218" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T14:34:06+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  2:34PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2008 2:36PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnypundit</cite>I like skill lists done right, i.e. those that actually make all those options matter.

So there must be doors in the game that demand lockpicking. This isn't a game where the GM gives you a door and waits for you to figure out how to get through.<br/>2) Skills flag the fun you want. You choose speech because you want to talk to people.

What I like about choosing skills is that they rule stuff <i>out</i> as much as they rule it <i>in</i>. Imagine we've got two sets of envelopes on the game table: blue ones, which contain everything in the computer files; and red ones, which contain everything you can persuade people to tell you. You can choose Hack Skill or Persuade Skill. Either way, you'll get to open one set of envelopes, during the course of the game, but the others will be forever sealed to you.<br/><br/>I'd phrase 3 as follows: if a skill is <i>necessary</i>, don't make it a choice. If every character needs to fight, don't give them a choice between Lockpick or Fight. Have two separate pools for the two sorts of skills: Necessary Fighting Skills and Optional Information-Gathering Skills.<br/><br/>Something like that.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Classic example: two-weapon ranger vs. archery ranger in D&amp;D4e. One is highly mobile, hitting and running. The other is all about ducking behind cover while firing at range. A more extreme example (also from D&amp;D) would be the artful dodger rogue vs. the brutal scoundrel. In all these cases, the feats and exploits are part of the character's skill set, and the player's as well. In 4e D&amp;D, the main challenge in the game is combat-related, so all the classes (even the wizard) have combat abilities on par with each other. But each approaches the problem of combat in a different way suited to that class.<br/><br/>In FreeMarket, all the skills ("experiences" in Donut-lingo) have the same net result: they help you earn flow. But each does it in an interesting, different way with all kinds of benefits and drawbacks. And best of all, there are no dud experiences. Your bad ass mercenary character and your peaceful pumpkin farmer both have a place in the game and in the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185247/#Comment_185247" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T18:53:24+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  6:53PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

There, each skill (ability in Agon) helps you garner currency, but also has a unique use in the fiction that gives the player a hand in how the story goes. The character with oratory gets to decide where the group goes. They one with music gets a bonus to refreshing.<br/><br/>At first glance, this matches up with Graham's evelopes. Each envelope corresponds to me getting a special hook into the fiction.<br/><br/>But Graham's talking as if the contents of the envelope are really already there. Am I right Graham? This isn't quite the same as having the orate skill in Agon. In Agon, what's inside the envelope is permission to do something. <br/><br/>So what if the envelope contains actual content? The red envelopes contain portions of the world you only get to explore if you can pick locks. Does this mean there's some poor content creating GM who is doomed to see half their content ignored and un-used? That doesn't sound right.<br/><br/>But we've got some other ways to generate content. The envelopes could contain oracles. Traveller had this method of encapsulating a planetary system's vital stats in a single stream of characters (the UPP code). The envelope could contain something like that. So in your envelopes you've got simple, evocative seeds that can be used to generate situation quickly.<br/><br/>Do the envelopes in this case offer a real choice? Or is it just the illusion of choice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185253/#Comment_185253" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T20:17:16+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  8:17PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I can't have everything.

Imagine a guy who makes sure his character can win a fight in two hits so that he'll never be in a fight that lasts longer than two hits -- if you look at his character sheet and say "Oh ho!  He's a mighty warrior, so I will make sure he faces terrible monsters that will test the very limits of his martial prowess!", you'll probably ruin that guy's fun.  He doesn't <i>want</i> combat to be a challenge, he's just deciding that combat may not always be avoidable and he's designing his character to minimize the amount of time and effort he has to put into it.<br/><br/>It's better to just ask a player what their skill choices mean to them, I think.  Find out if he's choosing science because he wants to delve into the minutiae of hacking the system, or if he's choosing it because he just wants to hit the "I WIN, LET'S MOVE ON" button whenever a science-based challenge rears its ugly head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185265/#Comment_185265" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T23:24:05+00:00" title="December 29, 2008 11:24PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite><br/>2) Skills flag the fun you want.

You had a list of hundreds of skills. Now the irony was that it is largely a game about war and you are trapped in the body of a cyborg so in the vast majority of the skills, that list of skills was meaningless.<br/><br/>My Lesson from Cyborg Commando: If it ain't important, don't include it.<br/><br/>I think a well chosen skill list is essential. Now, skill can be used to define characters and help shape a concept, but in games like Rolemaster with its massive lists, it allowed your character to be distinct but it greatly limited what you could do. It seemed to create more barriers and obstacles with such a large list of skills but with so little mastery.<br/><br/>My Lesson from Rolemaster: The larger the skill list the less characters can do<br/><br/>And then there is the danger that there are some things that probably shouldn't be skills. Skills should be ways to distinguish characters and provide options. If the game requires something, than perhaps it shouldn't be a skill. Here, I'm thinking about Whispering Vault. In this game players are supernatural beings pursuing unnatural things undermining reality. There was a three step process used to stop, bind and exorcise the entity. Every character needed it. And when I ran the game my players probably didn't invest as much as they should have in it and basically couldn't carry out their objective. If it is something that important or that central, it shouldn't be hidden in a skill list but emphasized somehow, being produced out of a different pool of points or treated as an ability or as an intrinsic component of the game.<br/><br/>Lesson from Whispering Vault: If something is integral to the game, don't make it an optional skill, integrate it straight into the character<br/><br/>Now we're discussing skills in a computer game. The game was designed to take into account those skills and to allow those skill choices shape the emerging narrative. So you've got a single player and one single vision of how that particular game is going to play out. <br/><br/>Now what happens when you've got three characters playing the game and choosing three different sets of skills with three different objectives in mind? In Fallout, you used to be able to take a Pacifist Talker who could basically talk their way out of most situations. That's not going to work with someone who bought all their points in heavy weaponry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185298/#Comment_185298" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T08:09:30+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  8:09AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know, Jason.

Your game, at your table, is finite.  You will only play a finite number of hours, do a finite number of things, fight a finite number of monsters, et cetera.  Your game experience is and always will be finite.  An RPG as a published product is also finite \u2014 put together all of the finite actual plays of the game, and you still have a finite amount of play and a finite amount of experiences.<br/><br/>What RPGs are and computer games (generally) are not is <em>potentially</em> infinite \u2014 you can do any number of things, but you will always only ever do some of the things that you can do.  Now, you can take skill selection as some sort of indicator as to which things the players will end up doing and plan accordingly, sure.  That will get you play similar to, say, Spirit of the Century: high-action, lots of attention on individual characters and a focus on character competency.

The world is infinite. It hasn't been defined. In CRPGs, if it hasn't been defined, it doesn't exist. It can't exist. In a table-top RPG, the world is infinite.

Otherwise the monsters kill me. And that feels, slightly, like the game's betraying me. It told me I could choose any of the skills. But actually there's some skills that I need to choose. And it didn't tell me that.</blockquote>This is a conundrum for a designer. I've worked my game Fabula for over a decade now, a game with many and broad skill-lists, and still I face this conundrum.<br/><br/><b>Thinking aloud here:</b><br/>Thing is: even though a role-playing game is broad in its skill-spectrum, the scenarios actually played may be narrow in theme, so you need to focus on one part of the spectrum with your character, to fulfill your role as a player in that scenario. This goes for all characters in a game, and certainly in a computer game too (to make the characters interact in a meaningful way). The skills are important connection-points between your character and the scenario, and thus the characters needs a minimum of operative skills. When you are equipped with operative skills your actions will feed the drama of the game, making any conflicts run with depth and excitement.<br/><br/>In most computer-games the scenario is fixed, while in a tabletop rpg it will vary (to some extent, depending on the scenarios published and/or the GM). My game Fabula has a variety of themes (I've played 30-40 campaigns in it myself), but still I get campaigns where I see that the theme renders parts of my skill-lists un-operative. Some campaigns has a focus that excludes some skills.<br/><br/>Players are moaning about this, and the only answer I can give them is that the campaign/scenario dictates what is useful and what is not. Even though this may render some character-types less useful as a whole, it has to be accepted by the players. But it also has to be delt with by me, by trying to be in the forefront of any problems arising in the wake of a focused theme.<br/><br/><b>One way of dealing with it:</b> I take great care in stating the focus of the campaign at the start, and give the players good tools for fleshing out their characters to suit the campaign. The characters still carries some dead skills around, but as long as they are operational in the narrative, it is mostly ok.<br/><br/><b>Another way of dealing with it:</b> I use a special character-set well suited to the campaign (Fabula got 11 different character-sets), so as to make the players make their choices within a confine that suits the campaign we're embarking on.<br/><br/><b>A third way of dealing with it:</b> in long campaigns, where time and XP is ample, I leave it to the players to transform their characters during the campaign, to get them in tune with the theme. As the characters transform (into fighting men, or artists, or traders, or whatever), I start turning up the heat in the challenges, and focus even more on the theme. This often leads to some frustration, especially with players choosing the "wrong" character-types initally, but as long as I know what I do, and why, I always manage to lead them through the transforming stage of the campaign in a fulfilling way.<br/><br/><b>To have a clear vision, and to communicate it in a positive way, is essential.</b> So the game you are talking about makes ONE big mistake in my view: it fails to tell you that <i>fighting-ability</i> is a requisite for the character. Aside from that it sounds like a fine game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185447/#Comment_185447" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-31T07:28:50+00:00" title="December 31, 2008  7:28AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thing I used to do with Cyberpunk 2.0.  Each PC gets a set number of skills (I think it's 40) to divide amongst a short skill list (I think it's 10) based on their character class.  I used the players' allocation of skill points to rough out what kind of challenges they would face, and how difficult they should be.  2 points in Grooming &amp; Style?  That means roughly 2 out of every 40 rolls should be in that arena, with appropriate difficulty.  It should really be 'conflict' and not 'roll', but I didn't say conflict back then.  This provided a good starting point for customizing the content of the game to the players' desires.<br/><br/>You have to make sure everybody's on the same page as to why skills are chosen.  If somebody is choosing them to avoid having to deal with the situation, they'll hate the game.  Also, player <i>expectations</i> play a big part here.  If they think "Jamey always has tons of investigation in his games" they might take investigation skills, and fulfill their own prophecy.

I'm involved in a sim campaign using it that holds the mechanical system of gurps as pretty damn important.  Whenever you try and do anything in the game it's likely there is a skill that applies.  To buy all the skills that you could possibly need would cost tons of points and if you used those points elsewhere you'd have a much more interesting character.  You can use defaults which are based off your attributes but the numbers usually end up being pretty low.</blockquote>\nI hate this too. Shadowrun has an interesting system where a skill-tree indicates the modifier for using a skill different than the primary required one, that is a step towards solving the "too narrow" problem.
