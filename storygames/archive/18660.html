Bond-flavour, that is; globe-trotting, explosions, nice cars and nicer women, that sort of stuff.<br/><br/>Before I commit to developing it into a full game, I'd like to have a look at what already exists in that space. If there's something that already scratches a lot of the same itches, I'd rather know about it now - even if I decide that it's different enough to what I'm thinking about, maybe there's some insights in there that might be helpful.<br/><br/>So. Spy games. What's out there? What do you guys recommend? What's good-but-dated? What's still a good time?<br/><br/>(And, bonus question: is there anything you're looking for in a spy game that's never quite come together?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419156/#Comment_419156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T21:48:25+00:00" title="July 28, 2013  9:48PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know too much about it, but I played <a href="http://spione.adept-press.com/" rel="nofollow">Spione (by Ron Edwards)</a> at Go Play NW this year. It's a game about spies in Cold War Berlin (with the exact decade being randomly generated). It's a GMless game that is categorically NOT about globe-trotting, explosions, nice cars and nicer women, instead being about the very cold harsh realities of being a spy during the Cold War while also trying to maintain relationships as a human being. It was intense and fun, and its got a playing card based mechanic for conflicts and stuff. One mechanic in particular keeps it quite grounded and that was pretty serious and interesting. If you care I'll explain it, but it does the opposite of what you're talking about so it probably doesn't matter.<br/>So, uh, not at all the sort of spy game you're talking about, but still a member of the spy game genre and a cool thing.<br/><br/>What I'm curious about from your game is how you'd handle the crazy gadgetry. That's where my interests tend to lie in the over-the-top spy genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards" title="Ron Edwards"><img alt="Ron Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Edwards">Ron Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419158/#Comment_419158" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-28T22:02:09+00:00" title="July 28, 2013 10:02PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Spycraft D20, right? It covers a pretty wide range of approaches to spy stories, but definitely favors the action/explosion material.<br/><br/>Going back to the days of yore, there's James Bond 007, from the tail-end of role-playing's first major innovative phase. On the one hand you have some pretty complicated tables and multiplication and stuff to resolve events, but on the other, you have points players can spend to add significantly to the fictional situation above and beyond the character.<br/><br/>I guess my main recommendations would be GURPS: Espionage and GURPS: Covert Ops.

If your group is all on the same page with the setting and flavour, it'd be really straightforward to use Fate Core or FAE to do Bond-style games.<br/><br/>Agents of Oblivion is an espionagey setting for Savage Worlds - the Savage Worlds rules fit really well for high-action spy capers, where the PCs are powerful but still vulnerable to, eg, being shot at.<br/><br/>I hear lots of good things about Night's Black Agents - it's espionage vs. Vampires, but I've seen AP reports of people playing it as a straight thriller.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419173/#Comment_419173" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-29T07:44:27+00:00" title="July 29, 2013  7:44AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another vote for Spycraft D20 here, at least for what you're talking about.

Early on in setting up, the players collectively create the agency for which they work and what their positions therein are. A relationship map gets built as part of this process, and through filling that out and studying it between moments of excitement, tons of inspiration falls out. This is the game you want to run if the characters may not necessarily be street agents but could have interactions both within and outside the agency. (If you pressed me, I might say that it's the best of the lot; the mechanics and simple die pool which drives the engine between players is quite good indeed.) <br/><br/>Getting your hands on any of these things should be pretty easy; one of the great advantages of living on the Internet is that the smart producers never go out of print.

Plots can sometimes end up seeming a little labyrinth-like but reflect the interests of the players very nicely.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://realms.co.uk/covenant/" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a></b> \u2013 the dark horse runner in this particular pack, it's been on my shelves for quite a while as one of the front runners in the new wave of indie design RPGs. Early on in setting up, the players collectively create the agency for which they work and what their positions therein are. A relationship map gets built as part of this process, and through filling that out and studying it between moments of excitement, tons of inspiration falls out. This is the game you want to run if the characters may not necessarily be street agents but could have interactions both within and outside the agency. (If you pressed me, I might say that it's the best of the lot; the mechanics and simple die pool which drives the engine between players is quite good indeed.) <br/><br/>Getting your hands on any of these things should be pretty easy; one of the great advantages of living on the Internet is that the smart producers never go out of print. If you can only try one of these, make it <b>Covenant</b>. You won't be sorry.</blockquote>\nThat's an excellent rundown on these games. In particular, I had never heard of Killshot before and now you make me want to take Covenant down from my shelf and actually play it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419751/#Comment_419751" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-07T14:49:03+00:00" title="August  7, 2013  2:49PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bordering on the spy genre (maybe at the Bourne end) is <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/Hollowpoint" rel="nofollow">Hollowpoint</a>.

The PCs would  work together for their mother Faction trying to sabotage the others, and each faction would confer wildly different assets, resources and psychological profiles for the team, that could reflect the factions in-game atributes (Gaians = hippie psychics mind-worm lovers). <br/><br/>Give it a cool thematic-narrative system in the veins of Mountain Witch, Cold City and Lady Blackbird, where the players work together but also against each other for accomplishing their own secret agendas, and trust and betrayal come to the fore. Bonus if they have secret agenda cards in the vein of Mountain Witch Fates and one of those is "deserting with a faction SECRET PROJECT", ala Datajack "Cinder" Rose in Alien Crossfire. Also give it a stylish minimalist presentation ala Lady Blackbird or Apocalypse World and I would toss lots of money in it.<br/><br/>Or do it in the Vampire splatbooks fashion..<br/><br/><br/>1. Core book describing the setting and all factions, with a built-in Probe Team "inter-faction" campaign. <br/><br/>2. 7 "Splat books", each describing a faction individually, with campaigns thematicaly related to it (Believer Inquisitors, Gaian Eco-terrorists, Hive Thought-Police, Spartan Commandos, etc). And maybe even describing the Alien Crossfire sub-factions (eg: Morganite Sourcebook with stuff on the Data Angels; Gaians Sourcebook with stuff on the Prophet; Academician Sourcebook would contain stuff on the Cybernetic Consciousness; etc).<br/><br/>3. release the "Aliens book", describing the Progenitors and its sub-factions Caretakers and Usurpers. And a campaign for pitting all other factions against the aliens (so one could have a crackshot team of an Spartan Commando, a Believer Inquisitor, a Gaian Eco-terrorist and a Data Angel Hacker side by side doing black ops against the aliens). <br/><br/>Oh man, I would kill for such a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420730/#Comment_420730" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-26T18:35:15+00:00" title="August 26, 2013  6:35PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On a side-note, Im having tons of fun with the latest Splinter Cell pc game.

I'd love to play something quick and fun between <i>Mission Impossible</i>, &lt;&lt;i&gt;Alias and <i>Chuck (tv series)</i>. Over-the-top spy action with some humor and drama, in a global sunny jetset setting with spy agencies and freelancers.<br/><br/>The systems I like most are <b>Leverage</b> (Cortex Plus, as mentioned before).<br/><br/>Another nice little AW-hack spy game is <b><a href="http://www.storyweaver.com/Games/Deniable.aspx" rel="nofollow">Deniable</a></b>. It's a quick one-shot style spy game with a few random tables. Sort of ApocalypseWorld meets Fiasco in a spy setting.<br/><br/>(oops, just saw the original thread is from 2013...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X" title="Charlie_X"><img alt="Charlie_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/513/nSBLNVCY6RNQO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">Charlie_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451939/#Comment_451939" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-21T22:48:03+00:00" title="March 21, 2016 10:48PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love <b>Spycraft</b>, although it's quite intensive on the GM side and gear can be a bit of a slog. The *craft system is the best use of d20, though. Second edition has some better aspects but first keeps things like gear and scaling enemies down. Both have been systems I've run several campaigns and con games for.<br/>I've yet to try Emily Care Boss' <b>Spy-Fi</b>, but it looks great as a way of mechanising the dialogue between agents, control and enemies.
