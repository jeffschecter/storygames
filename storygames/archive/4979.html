Has been for weeks.</i><br/><br/>A game for up to six players.  Each player chooses one chess piece - King, Queen, Knight, Rook, Bishop, Pawn.  This is their character; all characters are members of a medieval fantasy court.  <br/><br/>On the table is a page with seven circles on it.  Each circle is "a stage", except one, which is labelled "offstage".  Each piece goes on one circle.  <br/><br/>The king's stage is labelled "the throne room".<br/>The queen gets "the gardens", <br/>the knight (captain of the guard) gets "the castle wall", <br/>the rook (the castle seneschal) gets "below stairs",<br/>the bishop (local abbot or abbess) gets "the chapel", <br/>and the pawn (the hapless squire) gets "the stables".<br/><br/>Rules:  <br/><br/>1. Take turns moving around, most of the time.  I think.<br/><br/>2. If you are on your own stage?  You get no scene.  You're too busy, holding court, dealing with the ladies-in-waiting, organising guards, whatever it is that you *do*.  By entering your own stage, you automatically call an end to whatever scene is occurring there.<br/><br/>3. If you are on someone else's stage, you're in a scene.  The person whose character 'owns' that stage?  They're the GM, there.<br/><br/>.........<br/><br/>This needs a conflict (or group of them).  And a resolution system.  And maybe some other stuff.

The further you are from your space affects your control over the scene/character competence/etc.  Because the king is still relatively comfortable in the queen's garden, but woefully out of place in the stables.

So, yeah, this kind of thing totally works.  I've been messing with it for the past 2 years, in a wide variety of contexts, and have had great results.  Honestly, I suspect that Shreyas' familiarity with these games, most of which lack a conflict resolution system in a traditional sense, is what is leading to his being a smartass in this thread.<br><br>One suggestion.  I've found that it's more interesting if every piece can't move to every room whenever it wants.  So I've been coming up with more complex maps so there's a tiny bit of maneuvering that goes on, pushing people towards more interesting choices that they wouldn't normally consider.  For example, Transantiago uses maps that are generated during play, ending up with something like this:<br><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/ts-10.jpg"/><br/>So think about how cool it would be if there was actually a map of the castle, maybe even with different floors and stuff, like in Kill Doctor Lucky or House on the Hill.  It wouldn't have to be complex (I mean, you're just talking about 6-8 rooms or something), but I think that might make for more evocative and interesting play.  Then again, that may not fit your design specifications, but it's not clear what those are yet, yeah?<br/><br/>So, yeah, you need something for the story to be about, otherwise you just have people wandering through the castle.  What if it's like, Hamlet, or something?  The old king is dead, his ghost (a white king, perhaps) is wandering the castle.  In fact, maybe the previous royal family is all dead, so you have white ghost pawns and rooks and whatever wandering the castle.  And perhaps the players playing the black pieces are trying to exorcise the spirits (with the help of bishops) or appease them by fulfilling their dying wishes or just plain old getting killed by them.  And, when you did, maybe you play the ghosts or play your own character as a ghost or something.<br/><br/>In any case, that's just one game idea.  Seems like there's a ton of things you could potentially do with this.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_111870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111870/#Comment_111870" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T06:50:01+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  6:50AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Actually, Jon, I'm trying to encourage the precise and attentive use of language.

I mean, it seems like a really tactile scene-framing hack that can be applied to everything from Savage Worlds to possibly Polaris. I love the concept behind it, but it doesn't seem enough to split into its own thing. <br/><br/>Or, alternately, it could be used as a very very rules-light RPG: Can be played anywhere on the fly if there's a chessboard. If so, I'd love to see the final rules be able to be folded up into like a business card-sized pamplet and tucked in a wallet.<br/><br/>Also: Jonathan's ideas on board gamey RPGs is awesome too, with limitations on movement and the like. The only thing is that a lot of playtesting is gonna be needed to make sure the emergent behaviors are what you're looking to get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111895/#Comment_111895" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T08:14:39+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  8:14AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've already got 8 rows on a chess board.

Why has the Bishop left the Abbey to go to the gardens?<br/><br/>* You can move any piece, but you are "attached" to that piece until your next move (relates to next point).<br/><br/>* If a piece occupies the same square as another piece, each player--the currently moving player and the one who is attached to the attacked piece--expends Resources to frame facts about the encounter; use the file to determine the Stage, which provides a mechanical benefit (TBD; resource savings?) to the piece for whom it's the home rank (if any).<br/><br/>* The victor in the conflict is the one who can best "ping" the facts of the scene: just tally up who pings more facts.

The loser must go down in rank OR go back to its file; but her or she receives Resources equal to the differential between pinged facts tallies.<br/><br/>* The game ends when any piece is moved to the highest rank, with appropriate narration of the outcome to suit (a) the presumed setting--needn't be a court, now, eh?-- and (b) the piece which attains the highest rank:<br/>-- The King asserts his authority, crushing all opposition.<br/>-- The Queen becomes regent over her infant son, the successor to the crown.<br/>-- The Bishop stages a theocratic coup.<br/>-- The Knight stages a military coup and establishes a dictatorship.<br/>-- The Rook makes off with the kingdom's treasury.<br/>-- The Pawn... uh, I dunno... causes a democratic rebellion? :}<br/><br/>And then it could work with gangsters, a corporate organization, whatever.<br/><br/>Hope this helps to at least spur your thinking (as if you need it from me, but still);<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112062/#Comment_112062" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T13:08:44+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  1:08PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2007 1:10PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your setup reminds me a bit of 1001 Nights.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>This needs a conflict (or group of them).

I can think of a few:<br/><br/>* The outer walls have fallen to the enemy, and it's only a matter of hours before they capture the castle.<br/>* It is the day of/before the prince's/princess's wedding (though, each would have their own tones).<br/>* An outbreak of plague has just happened (either normal plague or, hey, zombies)<br/>* Assassination (or failed assassination, though if you treat the King as the Crown Prince, there could be something neat there).<br/>* Today is an uneventful day in the kingdom, so let us entertain ourselves.<br/>* Are these people who, perhaps, have no memory and woke up in this castle and in these clothes, with people treating them as though they are the person they're portraying?<br/>* Jonathan's Hamlet-inspired idea is tasty.<br/><br/>One thing I'll say about map-based boardgame RPGs is that people had problems with why they couldn't leave the map when it would be otherwise well in character to do so.  When it comes to RPGs, people like to challenge the game, so consider what it means to leave the castle (or wherever your game will end up taking place).<br/><br/>The other thing to consider is *who* these characters are beyond their rank.  Is the Knight in love with the Queen, and his deepest desire is to sweep her away?  Does the Rook seek salvation from a crime he has committed, and the Bishop is exploiting this fact in order to have the Stable Boy silenced for what he has seen while keeping his own soul clean with God?  Is the King a fool or a sharp man, or perhaps a sharp man playing a fool?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112107/#Comment_112107" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T14:00:31+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  2:00PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>One thing I'll say about map-based boardgame RPGs is that people had problems with why they couldn't leave the map when it would be otherwise well in character to do so.</blockquote>\nReally?

Some people wanted out, the artist drew what could potentially be an out (that I colored in to suggest isn't not an actual exit, but the suggestion was still in the minds of players), so people felt cheated when they couldn't leave.  I'm not saying don't have it, but that if ones game is in a purely fixed location and you're playing with people who have come to understand RPGs as being a playground with freedom of movement (as I think is the baseline case, given the majority of gamers have play games like D&amp;D), you need to make that crystal clear and not introduce elements that may feel like an out.<br/><br/>Granted, when you play with people who accept this, you don't need to do as much -- but that's the case with any element of a game.  What happens in your game, Jonathan, if, say, my character has a flashback due to some action in the game that causes me to feel panic at being underground, so I run out of it.  Is the exit blocked off?  Am I out of the game?  Does this situation just not happen?  Is there something that keeps the character in the subway when the player feels it's out of character to do so, beyond an unspoken social contract to not fuck everyone's fun up by breaking the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112121/#Comment_112121" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T14:34:26+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  2:34PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get the feeling it's a <i>spoken</i> contract in this case which keeps the game going.

In mine, there was absolutely no "this is who you are" element, aside from "you have no memories."  Thus, there was a lot less of "they they don't" element because they were defining themselves by their actions.

Each secretly chooses a number of tokens (between one and seven) to bid and when both are ready they place one token in each rank of the 8th file starting at "their" edge of the board.  Squares with only one token have their tokens removed from play (i.e. unless one player bids enough tokens to reach the other player's across the board, they're all gone!).  Tokens that remain on the board are returned to whoever bid them.  The player who bid more tokens gets whatever stake she set, and the player who bid the less gets the other player's ante.<br/><br/>The problem with this scheme is that each player needs to start with a lot of tokens to keep the game going for any amount of time.  The non-zero-sum nature gives you a pacing mechanic you can play with, though.<br/><br/>I though of other meanings for eight files - six are the player's "home stages", the seventh is "the countryside" and the eighth is "a foreign land".  Bidding (if that's what ya go with) occurs in the file representing the stage in which the action is occurring, maybe?<br/><br/>Now I really want to come up with a story game that use a checkered board but not necessarily chess pieces...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112308/#Comment_112308" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T09:15:41+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  9:15AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>What if all the characters are already dead, already ghosts, dead tragically and by one another's actions....

Start them at opposite ends of the board (1st and 8th rank) and then once a Ghost piece is on the same square as a Why piece, we have the opportunity to bid and then frame the resolution (the How), using the Resource mechanic. The Ghost and Why piece needn't even match (in fact, might be hard to do in most games)--if they do, it's a suicide, I suppose; if they don't, murder or disease or some other A v B interaction that leads to death (Amidala's "heartbreak," even... as cheesy as it was).<br/><br/>Interesting. It's only one potential "story" (how did we all die?), which is somewhat off-putting (to me) as compares to being able to use a variety of settings and situations; but it might be fun for a few games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zoatebix</cite>I though of other meanings for eight files - six are the player's "home stages", the seventh is "the countryside" and the eighth is "a foreign land".</blockquote>\nI like that... and those are one of (several) means to refresh one's pool of Resource.<br/><br/>Hmmm... but suppose its 1st and 8th rank instead of 7th and 8th; the countryside is next to the Pawn's rank (he's "closer to the people") and the foreign land(s) is, say, next to the Knight's file (he's "got contacts from the wars").
