They have some experience with pocket danger patrol homebrews.  What I really need is setting advice. The materials don't even need to exist.  I can do the write up myself, and create the materials.  But I am lost for ideas about a setting that might be interesting for this age group.  <br/><br/>If you have an idea please make a suggestion.    Something Chinese/ Korean/ Japanese anime or otherwise would be great.  The players are young Chinese mainlanders in senior elementary and middle school.  No grimdark please.  Something light and fun.  I really don't know anything about contemporary anime pop culture.<br/><br/>If there is a one-shot that meets these criteria, I'd be happy to hear about it. But if you have a setting idea, I'd love to hear about it too.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is that I don't know anything about popular anime.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469882/#Comment_469882" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T11:19:53+00:00" title="February 10, 2018 11:19AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They students speak English well enough to roleplay in English--that's the whole point to the activity anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469883/#Comment_469883" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T11:19:55+00:00" title="February 10, 2018 11:19AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They students speak English well enough to roleplay in English--that's the whole point to the activity anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469884/#Comment_469884" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T11:20:44+00:00" title="February 10, 2018 11:20AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The students...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469885/#Comment_469885" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T12:03:07+00:00" title="February 10, 2018 12:03PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not entirely sure you should venture into "anime" territory if <i>you</i> are clueless about it...<br/><br/>First thing coming to my mind, as they're learning English, is <i>Harry Potter</i>(-ish) - meaning school life + magical adventure + any small bits of British/American culture, or folklore, you might want to throw in.<br/><i>Magicians</i> is a published story game with a premise and setting amounting to, basically, Harry Potter exchange students in Korean Hogwarts. Recommended reading.<br/><br/><i><a href="https://isabout.wordpress.com/fables-of-camelot/" rel="nofollow">Fables of Camelot</a></i> is a game that has worked very well with middle schoolers (I live in Italy; my girlfriend, a schoolteacher, has used the game repeatedly as a class activity). Here, the setting concept (or the take on it that has worked best for us) is King Arthur &amp; the knights of the Round Table seen as a something in-between a <i>Masters of the Universe</i> cartoon and a YA fantasy novel.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I'm suggesting something purely "English" as your basic chassis. Such settings can then be peppered with just as much "anime" sensibility as your pupils see fit to bring to it - take cues from them and leave the door open for them do put their own spin on your pitch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469886/#Comment_469886" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T12:06:45+00:00" title="February 10, 2018 12:06PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and a cue I'm taking from my manga/anime experience of a lifetime: young people feel that characters in the next age bracket are cool, because they represent idealized types they might strive to become.

For this reason the best setting is probably one that you want to work with, and that features situations and imagery that are intelligible to children.<br/><br/>I'll make two concrete setting suggestions:<br/><br/>The first is Harry Potter. Set it in Britain, at Hogwarts. The player characters are students, except in an exotic English setting (plus I guess the magic is exotic too). Do not twist yourself into a knot about whether the players know the IP in advance or not; you're not choosing Harry Potter for the IP, you're choosing it for its virtues in this situation:<br/><b>*</b> A school setting is familiar from life as well as anime. HP is in a genre that is very popular in the Far East, the magic school adventure drama. Literally half of the stuff your students are watching right now are in this genre. (Or maybe it's just half of the donghua that gets translated, I wouldn't know.)<br/><b>*</b> If the point of the activity is to learn English, then a school adventure story set in Great Britain provides you with the correct cultural setting, lots of simple learning situations, a plethora of NPCs in natural authority positions... Seems like a pretty good starting point for something both fun and educational. Get their characters ordering fish and chips from a street vendor in London.<br/><br/>My second suggestion is to take one of the following two popular Chinese light novel / comic book / cartoon series, and adapt the setting, characters, plot - whatever you need - from them:<br/><br/><a href="http://battle-through-the-heavens.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_Through_The_Heavens_Wikia" rel="nofollow">Battle Through the Heavens</a><br/><a href="http://soulland.wikia.com/wiki/Soul_Land_Wiki" rel="nofollow">Soul Land</a><br/><br/>Both are fantasy shonen in genre, basically; I'm suggesting two simply because the former has a more usable plot while the latter has a more usable setting. I would personally expect that I'd get a fine campaign for 10-year olds by combining certain plot concepts from the former with the setting of the latter; probably not very authentically Chinese after I went through them with a hacksaw, but nevertheless recognizable. The various iterations of both are easily accessible in the Internet (also in English); you would obviously want to read or watch your chosen material patiently, making notes to get on board with the particulars. I would not expect them to be difficult to understand for somebody familiar with western fantasy genre stuff.<br/><br/>Despite those suggestions featuring some seeming synergy with your situation (British setting and a Chinese setting), you'll probably do best by choosing something that you can be confident about yourself, as long as it's age-appropriate. Might as well do <i>Masters of the Universe</i> or <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> or whatever floats your own boat, first and foremost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469889/#Comment_469889" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T12:51:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2018 12:51PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Oh, and a cue I'm taking from my manga/anime experience of a lifetime: young people feel that characters in the next age bracket are cool, because they represent idealized types they might strive to become.

To have fun with a group of 9-11 year olds, you don't need some deep, exciting, and original setting. You can start small and let the details build up in play. I'd recommend keeping it as simple as you can, at first.<br/><br/>Kids generally like robots, aliens, ghosts, cool technology, and - most of all - getting to play important people who get a say in what happens. (Since childhood is often limited to a life where it feels like you have little or no agency, no important decisions to make.)<br/><br/>For instance, take a look at something like my game 'The Bureau', written specifically for kids of this age:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17652/apocalypse-world-for-kids-the-bureau-an-aw-hack-with-different-die-types</a><br/><br/>All you need is to say, "the world is as we know it, but..." [some weird thing recently happened, and you're the people who have to deal with it]. Your players will come up with plenty of details for you to develop the setting as you go along, and it fulfills the criteria I outlined above.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469923/#Comment_469923" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-11T09:28:01+00:00" title="February 11, 2018  9:28AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>[M]ost of all - getting to play important people who get a say in what happens.

However my advice would be to let them create characters they want to play and then brainstorm a world they could coexist, with a few interesting places, a crisis they must avert, a reason to explore the world or a mistery to clear, and then set them loose on it.<br/><br/>A few really good things from this:<br/>-They will get invested quickly, specially if you inmediately take on whatever they throw at you and turn it into an interesting playable idea. There's always at least one kid who tries to make a joke with their input, but if you surprise them by taking their joke seriously they will always change their stance completely and even start to edit themselves, switching into serious creative mode.<br/>-They will all become familiar with the setting as they made it up, so this helps you make sure everyone is on the same page.<br/>-Amazingly, no matter what you put on the mix, if you are being consequent with everyone's input, the world turns out to be consistent. It doesn't matter if the characters are saiyan-jedi warriors piloting valkyries (actually happened)<br/>-Also, once a general trend is established, players will autoedit themselves to make things fit into the world, instead of making it purposely gonzo. You still have to be open for some gonzo anyway, but you only need to oultine a few rules, like "I'm okay with that as long as you explain why it makes sense in this world" and "No item, skill or power is 100% reliable. it may still fail, be activated too late or not work against a particular opponent"<br/>-Making up something together is a different kind of fun, since it involves both learning about others, explaining stuff and building up over someone else's input, which in turn becames a reward to the person who gave that input, as a form of recognition.<br/><br/>Main drawbacks: you will need some improv skills to pull it up, be able to play unsafe, be ready to be surprised by the story and still able to push the players and wrap scenes at the right moment.
