The short answer is that you can basically do whatever is functional for your text, and the typography police won't come knocking.<br/><br/>The long answer is that typographical rules are usually of roughly two types: there are rules of tradition, which have been developed through time (sometimes centuries), and then there are rules of function, which are basically caused by practical considerations. An example of the former is the way paragraphs are often separated from each other by a line break and indent; an example of the latter is that using a different typeface for different types of captioning helps the reader perceive the structure of a work. Breaking a rule of tradition has the consequence of having professionals smirk at you, and if the break is sufficiently large, having the layman notice it, whether for good or ill. Breaking a functional rule has the consequence that your work is not as good as it could be. Of course a major problem with all this is that rules are usually traditional because they are very, very functional.<br/><br/>Using bold and italics in particular manners is not really traditional in the overall field, but there are traditions within sub-categories of book design for their use. For example, if you were doing a newspaper or magazine, you would typically bolden any personal names you introduce; it's just a tradition of the form, so doing it makes the work look more like a journalistic text. However, gaming books do not have this sort of unified design tradition; the closest they come is the fact that the heavier sort of reference works usually loan much book design from technical writing. However, that sort of thing depends on the game: some games have a novel-like linear look without indexes or anything, as they're intended to be read as a linear whole, while others have explicit multiple levels of captioning, an index and plenty of typographical detail supposed to help the reader in understanding the structure and finding specific parts of the text.<br/><br/>Looking at the functional part of the equation, the primary reason to use italics or bolding in your average game text is to draw your reader's attention to the special epistemological status of the word you're using. When you say that <i>dice</i> are rolled, the reader has the reason to believe that these <i>dice</i> you speak of are a special category of being somehow different from the norm you might be discussing. In gaming books this effect is very typically used to draw the reader's attention to the fact that a given term is not used with a general meaning, but in a special way that is ideally to be immediately defined in the text.<br/><br/>Another functional issue is that over-using these effects is likely to make the text typographically uneven and tiring to read - the reader will tire of the overuse of an effect and stop interpreting it (subconsciously, I mean). So modicum is good.<br/><br/>Combining the above functional considerations, the overwhelmingly common way of using typeface cuts with game terms is that you only italize the term when introducing it; this is not necessarily only the first time in the text, but also when the term comes up suddenly after a while of discussing something else, perhaps in an entirely new chapter. If your term is such that you need to distinguish it constantly from other meanings of the same word, the good ol' capitalization is a better choice than italics or bolding. "If any of the player characters is a Wolf, then unless they can Roll a Success, they will also be White." That sort of thing.<br/><br/>For a lexicon you're looking at an entirely different type of text than normal prose, so the logic you'll use basically has nothing to do with that used in prose. Without knowing more about your project, you probably won't go far astray if you bold the term that is to be defined and italicize any other special terms that also make an appearance in the same lexicon. Thus: "<b>Gamera</b> is a giant, flying <i>turtle</i> from a popular series of <i>kaiju</i> films produced by Daiei Motion Picture Company in Japan."<br/><br/>Also, one more thing: bold and italics by themselves are two relatively arbitrary typeface variants that do not carry much historical significance - the idea that all fonts have an italic and bold variant is basically the product of the computer age. There are other text effects you can use, and there's no need to limit your typographical expression to solely these two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263163/#Comment_263163" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-20T19:28:02+00:00" title="March 20, 2010  7:28PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a case study in effective type variation (bold, italics, and large size, mostly), I recommend any of Scott McCloud's books (Understanding Comics, Reinventing Comics, Making Comics).

But again, that's personal taste.<br/><br/>A key point, however- whatever convention you decide on, stick to it throughout your text.

The answer to this question has a lot to do with what you want the book to be, what feeling you want to communicate with it, how the typeface works with the other elements on the page, etc.<br/><br/>I actually wrote up a style guide for <i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i> to give to my editors and layout person. Here's a version of it:<br/><br/>* The first time a game term is mentioned, it should be in a uniform style that identifies it (what this is typographically hasn't been decided yet but probably something like bold or italics).<br/>* A unique (unchosen) typeface to represent choices one must make off of a list.<br/>* Where possible, stressing of words by typographical means should be avoided in favor of stressing through writing and voice.<br/>* When The Authority is referred to, capitalize the article "The."<br/>* Capitalize words where failure to do so will result in frequent confusion with the ordinary version of that word. So, clique is not capitalized because it's a rare word that won't come up a lot except in the specific game sense I mean, whereas Struggle is capitalized because in a game like this, it's quite likely I'd use it in its non-specific-to-this-game sense.<br/>* Capitalize the names and the names-of-values of all Convictions (traits). E.g., Fast is a Means Conviction.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>And so on. It gets way more complicated than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263229/#Comment_263229" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T09:35:06+00:00" title="March 21, 2010  9:35AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who has read one million gaming books, I would like to add that once you pick a rule for yourself, stick to it and don't change it 40 pages later, like EVERYONE ELSE DOES AAAAAAAAA                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263376/#Comment_263376" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T09:57:33+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  9:57AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Take a look at how <i>Ptolus</i> does this.

That's basically three markups around the term: the style, then xref, and the index marker.<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of fiddly work, but having to do all that to mark a first usage actually makes you MORE diligent about doing it. Conversely, you might find it best to do a read-through pass of your book with the sole purpose of applying this markup to first usages of terms (i.e. so you're focused only on that and not also revising and proofreading and so forth--LATE in the production process, in other words).<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
