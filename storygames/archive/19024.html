I took one part World of Dungeons and two parts Usagi Yojimbo RPG and mixed them up. I have zero artistic skills so sadly this is just presented to you as an artless pdf and I have linked the odt libre office file too in case you want to make changes. One cool part of this process was some of the Usagi RPG traits and mechanics needed very little tweaking and could be added to the WoD rules quite easily. I tried to keep the races and jobs from Usagi as true to the original RPG book as I could. Let me know what you think, hate it? Love it? Want to make it pretty? Does it need fixing? Is it broken? Thanks.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7q181qxzebcojgu/world%20of%20usagi.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/7q181qxzebcojgu/world of usagi.pdf</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/03vz85euy20qyd5/world%20of%20usagi.odt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/03vz85euy20qyd5/world of usagi.odt</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424856/#Comment_424856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-27T06:18:05+00:00" title="November 27, 2013  6:18AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At a quick glance I like it as a representation of the older system.  My initial thought though is that the bonuses are a little high for a *World system, it isn't difficult to have a character only failing rolls on snake eyes in whatever skill you choose, and in some cases pushing the 7-9 results nearly off the board as well.<br/><br/>1) consider raising the bar for failure, maybe 8 or 9.<br/>2) lower the bonuses, starting stats to +2, +1, 0 and -1, with racial and profession bonuses all being a flat +1.</blockquote>\n(Transcript from a conversation elsewhere)<br/>I'd have to agree. We're currently using Sanguine's "Autumn Moon" edition, so it's been a while since we've cracked open Stolze's books.<br/><br/>I'm not clear on the Deuls.  It seems like the "stance" should be chosen in secret, and revealed after the roll.<br/>Also, "Middle" should be +0, otherwise "Agressive" doesn't seem to present much of a benefit/risk.<br/><br/>Also, I'd consider re-writing one of the classes to generate XP.  Like, give the Shugyosa a move where they gain XP when following someone's advice, or when they spar with a superior.  Give the Monk a move that gives other PCs XP for following their advice, or gives them XP when they evaluate their own failure.<br/><br/>That kind of thing.<br/><br/>Overall, a great start.

I got pretty excited when I saw the thread title alone... I enjoyed the UY game (Greg Stolze version) a lot. <br/>And I love the comics, which I use to expand my Indonesian vocabulary into useless areas. I can't open a bank account but I can discuss the aftermath of a battle. <br/><br/>On duelling, I think it would make sense - and reflect the original UYRPG better* - if the middle stance ("tactical" stance?) gave you a bonus to the focus check, while the aggressive stance gave you a bonus to damage. You sacrifice precision to overwhelm your opponent. <br/><br/>Also, in the original things were set up so that the best counter to the defensive stand was the middle. <br/>So, e.g. <br/>Aggressive - focus +0, damage +2<br/>Tactical - focus +2, damage +0<br/>Defensive - focus +1, armour 2<br/><br/>Or something like that? <br/><br/><br/>* Although the attack modes were a little broken there, so this may not be 100% desirable.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/matthelps" title="matthelps"><img alt="matthelps" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/191/nAONR1J3FGXBO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/matthelps">matthelps</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424896/#Comment_424896" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-28T06:34:51+00:00" title="November 28, 2013  6:34AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your comments.

Duels are a ritualized combat that is very different from "normal" combat. So I figured they needed different rules. If you look at some kendo or samurai flick duels you can find different stances being used.<br/><br/>I will add a line to allow players to create embellishments with GM approval.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434429/#Comment_434429" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T14:26:31+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  2:26PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can take a leaf from the latest L5R maybe, and turn that Middle stance into a mental centring (in L5R it's centre stance) which gives you a bonus next action rather than the current one.

I always liked the moment of flipping over the cards in a duel, for the way it emulates the stand-off and sudden draw in chanbara films.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
