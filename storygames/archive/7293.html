I think many games miss that feeling because they handwave those restrictions for the expediency of adventure or whatever...<br/>\n2) Exploration, Again, there is time, desire and even necessity to explore the world and discover those things that are foreign to you. Like getting your first job or making your first girlfriend. Also, there is a theme of discovering what you are good/bad at. All the classes you have to take sort of force you to do a little bit of everything (some of it you might be able to do well, some not so much). Also, Until right around this age, you won't have enough electives to try stuff you think you might like...<br/>\n  Is that the sort fo thing you are looking for?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162040/#Comment_162040" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-11T13:29:52+00:00" title="August 11, 2008  1:29PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would need a reason.

If your game is about children PCs, then presumably there's a reason they're all kids and not adults.  Articulating that reason will go a long way to getting players on board so they can play your game as intentioned.  Not articulating that reason will get you Changeling: the Dreaming.  I need more than just "play a kid" to get the right direction, and I guarantee your players and readers will, too.

I remember coming to terms with being transgender, and I remember being in the closet.<br/><br/>High school was important for me because that was the first time I started feeling really at home with my friends. Friends started to be people who cared about me, not people who cared about the same stuff as me. And a few of those friends lost me when they discovered they cared more about pot than me.<br/><br/>As for what helps me remember that time? In terms of personal memories, hearing about my old friends or being closeted again.<br/><br/>My adolescence was about finding myself, and finding people who I was comfortable with.

For children? GAH!<br/><br/>The reason you want children in a game about abductees is because children have a much more fluid and adaptable world view. They are used to re-training their perceptions, whereas adults have dug a lot more mental ruts for themselves with repetition and reinforcement. Children are in the UNIQUE position to see themselves being abducted and respond with QUESTIONS. Holy fuck! That is absolutely and completely amazing. Because you know what an adult would do: formulate a plan of forward motion based on their immediate surroundings and past knowledge, and act. They would ask the bare minimum of questions, and only the ones that their little ruts reinforced them asking.<br/><br/>In other words, adults would only ask the same questions they had trained themselves to ask in new situations. Watch Cube, perhaps. The adults all ask questions that they assume they are specialized to answer. Safe, pointed questions.<br/><br/>Children are there because they can question, wonder, adapt, grow, and create at an alarming rate. They are maleable enough to weather the storm, whereas adults would either make or break.<br/><br/><br/>If you aren't including children in your game about abduction for those reasons, you're doing it for the wrong reasons. Adults are absolutely more controllable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162337/#Comment_162337" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T19:49:51+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  7:49PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=311735" rel="nofollow">Here, let me make you into a great Changeling GM.</a></blockquote>Is this offer valid for Changeling: the Lost as well?

Plus, if you're talking about the characters getting abducted, I don't think that's terribly child-oriented.<br/><br/>Hoog is right in that school is a really big part of kids' life. The characters are going to have some strong feelings about it. Who do they like or dislike? What are their teachers like? Who's the class clown? Is there a bully?<br/><br/>Maybe all the players could each write down a childhood memory and share them during chargen, then base their characters off what they should have done? The most important thing is that the players need to remember what their own childhood was like, and there's no easier way to do that than to talk about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162738/#Comment_162738" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-15T04:31:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2008  4:31AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's rather hard to say how to play children in general, over such a wide range.

The age at which kids move (or start to think about moving) from primary to secondary school (to use UK terms) is perfect for that, 10, 11, 12, 13, it's the age of Harry Pottery, Jennings, Swallows and Amazons kids, the kids in the Famous Five, Dark is Rising, and so forth.

The old woman in the old, sagging house with bats all around it - she's a witch! And as soon as someone's come up with that, everyone acts as though she is, in fact, a witch. You creep or sprint past her house, if you see her walking down the street, you duck and hide, dare each other to go and knock on her door and run so she doesn't turn you into a toad. That she's never done anything of the sort and that it's blatently impossible is irrelevant. See also 'don't step on a crack or you'll break your back'. I'm sure there's a way to encode this way of thinking into the mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to dig out the game Snow Day - was made for some long past Game Chef competition. Also, read lots of children's literature for inspiration (I just finished Charlotte Sometimes by Penelope Farmer, and can't recommend it enough - though something more like the Famous Five/Secret Seven sounds more relevant to your interests).

The sooner the better (maybe because "later" means growing up for <i>real</i>, not just getting the benefits of having grown up).<br/><br/>I still want to do all that, but now I know: I never will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
