If anyone has any questions, please fire away!<br/><br/><b>So, what's Um\xe4ut then?</b><br/><br/>It's a game.  About Heavy Metal.  It's very much in the vein of Guitar Hero, Metalocalypse or Spinal Tap.  The idea is to make your band rock more often and harder than anyone else.  It's a competitive game with no GM.<br/><br/><b>It's about Heavy Metal?  Cool!  What type of Metal?</b><br/><br/>Whatever you want!  But the book explains and gives an overview of four common flavours: Classic Metal, Thrash Metal, Glam Metal and Death Metal.  If you want to play a Prog Rock band, go right ahead.<br/><br/><b>Do I need to know all about Metal to play</b><br/><br/>Not really.  You just need to know <i>what</i> it is, but no real knowledge of Metal bands is required.  If you've seen Spinal Tap you know enough to play the game.<br/><br/><b>So what do the players do?</b><br/><br/>They quite literally rock out!<br/><br/>You want more of an explanation?  Well, ok then.<br/><br/>Each player controls the fate of a Metal band.  They play through scenes and make their bands more famous, get better at playing, write new songs and play gigs with each other.<br/><br/><b>Wait, each player controls a whole band?</b><br/><br/>Yes, that's right.  The band as a whole.  Each band consists 5 members, which usually means a singer, a lead guitar, a rhythm guitar, a bass player and a drummer.  But that doesn't need to be the case.  I mean, in one playtest Andrew Kenrick had "The Romanian Symphony Orchestra" as a member of his band.  Other people have had bands where the guy doing the lighting and pyro shows was pretty integral.  So as long as their are 5 people, it's all ok.<br/><br/><b>Isn't it difficult to keep track of 5 characters at once?</b><br/><br/>Not really.  At the start of the game, each member brings one "thing" to the band.  There's a space on the character sheet to write this down and it effects your band's Performance Traits.  So you might choose that your Lead Guitarist brings "Frantic Frettwork" and that gives your band a +1 to Technique.  That's the only thing you really need to keep track of, other than their name.<br/><br/><b>So do you play gigs?</b><br/><br/>Oh yes!<br/><br/>Gigs are a contest between bands.  Whenever there's a concert, there are always two bands playing: the Headliner and the Support Act.  Sometimes your band will be playing with another player's band, sometimes it'll be with a dummy band not directly controlled by any player.  If that's the case, the player to your right will control the dummy band.<br/><br/>Bands decide in secret what style of song they will play, from poetic Ballads to shredding Face Melters.  Combined with your band's Performance Traits this will effect how likely each band is to capture the imagination of the audience and win Glory.  The band with the most points of Glory at the end of the gig is the "winner" and gets more fans and more money than the other band.<br/><br/><b>How did all this get started?</b><br/><br/>It all started with Frank T's Setting Challenge last year.  I had this idea to use the Contenders mechanics for a game about something other than boxing.  So the original version of Uml\xe4ut was a setting for Contenders.  It was one of the finalists in the contest, although not the winner.<br/><br/>Since then there have been a hell of a lot of changes to the rules.  Contenders is a great game, but those rules really weren't delivering what I wanted Uml\xe4ut to be.  I wanted it to support a more pure tactical play, to give me some more "gamist" juice.  Contenders wasn't really ever designed to do that, so I needed to make serious changes.  As Gregor Hutton put it, I started with a Mercedes and was changing the engine and chassis to be a Hyundai.  I've ended up with something more like a tank, not that Mercedoid but you can see similarities.<br/><br/><b>So when is this out?</b><br/><br/>It's in playtest at the moment.  I'm tempted to say "when it's done" but assuming the current round of playtests goes well I might have some form of the game for sale at Dragonmeet this December.<br/><br/><b>Anything else?</b><br/><br/>Did I mention that your band can collect extra bonus points called Flaming Skulls?  You can spend them to take control of the narrative and do some other funky stuff, like potentially making members of someone else's band leave.<br/><br/><b>No, you didn't, but that sounds really cool!</b><br/><br/>Oh, it is.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90992/#Comment_90992" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T09:31:01+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  9:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that I'm stating the obvious here, but this game is frakking metal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90998/#Comment_90998" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-28T09:40:26+00:00" title="August 28, 2007  9:40AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *<i>mano cornuta</i> in your honor*<br/><br/>I salute you, Metal Warrior.

Do so now!</blockquote>\nBy the beard of Gygax!  You're right, I completely forgot to mention that!<br><br>As Geoff says, a Gig involves two bands.  During development and early playtests, this caused the problem that, while the gigs were fun to play and fun to watch, the players not directly involved found themselves sitting at the sidelines, amused and interested observers rather than engaged players.<br><br>To counter this, the game now casts any player not controlling one of the gigging bands as part of the audience.  These guys get to choose which of three song styles the audience really wish to hear played next.  They decide in secret along with the bands and all the cards are revealed at once.  Any band which matches the style chosen by an Audience player gets a bonus point of Glory for playing a crowd pleaser!  An audience player who manages to make it through a gig without ever giving out any Glory in this way will earn a Flaming Skull.  This is a pretty good incentive to avoid  giving out the glory and players try really hard to avoid it by choosing the least tactically advantageous style at any given point.  This in turn seems to prevent degenerate strategies from emerging, because if a player plays the same style over and over, it's easy to avoid giving them the crowd pleaser glory.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
