(Its actuall not my first playtest, its my first Actual Play)<br/><br/>unWritten is a game that allows you, the players, to create a setting, determine the games premise, and create the protagonists in the story. Game play consists of the players using the hero's journey to structure play, with a rotating GM each scene. Within each scene the hero's journey indicates the types of conflicts to push.<br/><br/>A couple of weeks ago my son, girlfriend, and I sat down to play a game of unWritten. My son, Julian is 15 and compares everything to D&amp;D, my girlfriend hates RPG's for the sake of hating them.<br/><br/>So sue me, I twisted their arms.<br/><br/>This version of the game (I made changes as a result of this playtest) starts out asking you to define the genre and the narrative constraint, then it goes into several questions that help you refine the setting. The questions focus on (in this order) environment, history (natural and social) society, and key setting characters. That may seem like a lot, and it can be, but the players are encouraged to give brief stereotypical answers. It'll show in the playtest.<br/><br/>Then you define the games premise, answering more questions that this time focus on key the game elements that the characters will be dealing with, and then you define the cues. This portion of setting creation builds off of the things you did in the previous section...<br/><br/>Needless to say these have been mightly streamlined!<br/><br/>Now you create the characters, answer 3 questions about the group, then three about each character. Now you define the characters Traits, of which there are 4, expertise, physical, social, and link. The first three are self explanitory, the fourth, link, is a trait that represents the characters connection to the setting. This can be anything from a sword to a memory.<br/><br/>Now we are ready to begin...<br/>The genre we were after was "Dramatic, Mystery, and Realistic." Despite loving Lost, my girlfriend hates sci fi... go figure.<br/><br/>The narrative constraint was "Dramatic," which is to say that the game was to focus on melodramatic conflicts, stuff that deals with interpersonal relationships and such.<br/><br/>Now keep in mind that we weren't going for historical accuracy, we were going for an interesting and engaging story.<br/><br/>answering the environment questions\n<ul>\n<li>Anchorage Alaska<br/>Mountains<br/>Waterways<br/>Ice &amp; Snow<br/></li>\n</ul>\nFor the historical questions\n<ul>\n<li>Extreme Weather<br/>Dark Phase, 4 hours of sunlight<br/>Running out of fish<br/></li>\n</ul>\nFor the societal questions\n<ul>\n<li>Inuit<br/>Red Necks<br/>Corporate Fishermen<br/>Police Dept.<br/>Inuits against corporate fishermen hire rednecks to fish and police for protection<br/></li>\n</ul>\nCharacter of note\n<ul>\n<li>Sherif<br/>corp exec<br/>chief Inuit<br/>Medicine man</li>\n</ul>\nThe protagonist centric questions had the following answers\n<ul>\n<li>wharf<br/>village<br/>sherifs office<br/>large inlet<br/>corp fishing ships<br/>modern fishing tech<br/>youth is questioning direction - follow inuit traditions or go for corp money<br/>engineered racism</li>\n</ul>\nIn the next post I'll go into the characters...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90269/#Comment_90269" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T16:15:43+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  4:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 4:37PM by alejandro.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The characters have three things that are the same across each character sheet and then each has a a few things that individualize the characters.<br/><br/>The games premise, the cues, and the answers to the group questions are the same, so here they are...<br/><br/>As we were creating the setting a situation arose that led itself to the games premise, which focuses narration, the fiction, and conflicts\n<ul>\n<li>An Inuit village struggles with tradition and joining the corporate fisheries that are taking their livelihoods</li></ul>\nthe group questions are and their answers are:<br/>what does the group want to get or achieve?\n<ul>\n<li>To resolve the fish shortage<br/></li></ul>\nWhat obstacles stand in the groups way?\n<ul>\n<li>the corporate fisheries<br/></li>\n</ul>Who are the groups allies, enemies, and rivals?<ul>\n<li>corp exec - enemies<br/>rednecks - enemies<br/>sherrif - enemies<br/>fishermen - rivals<br/>rednecks - allies</li></ul>\nand finally the cues\n<ul>\n<li>wharf<br/>corporate exec<br/>engineered racism<br/>inuit youth struggling with tradition<br/>sheriff<br/>redneck - allies<br/>cheif inuit<br/>corp money<br/>tradition<br/>ice and snow<br/>waterways<br/>redneck - enemies</li>\n</ul>\nNow, for the characters we had to answer some character questions, define the traits, and finally describe the characters reaction...<br/><br/>Rhonda 40 - my girlfriends character<br/>character questions<br/>what does your character look and act like?\n<ul>\n<li>short and rotund, peaceful, wise</li></ul>\nwhat does your charcter want out of achieving the group's goal?\n<ul>\n<li>(I want) my son to choose tradition</li>\n</ul>\nwho or what do you care about, love, or hate that can be used against you during the game?

What I got out of this was seeing that I could create a setting in a very mundane environment with mundane characters. I would love to see that premise played out, Inuits struggling with tradition in a modernizing society (which happened to be several hundered miles away... but thats a minor detail) in an RPG.<br/><br/>Maybe I'll get to actually play this actual play.<br/><br/>I was actually able to figure out how to streamline the process of setting creation. Everytime I've done with my regular play group it would take a long time, but it was always so much fun and by the end of it we were totally excited about what we going to do in it. But by strong arming my girlfriend and son I saw some where things could be changed for the better.<br/><br/>Now the setting questions optional and less cues are required, etc.<br/><br/>This is my first Actual Play, and I feel like I just wrote a novel. Can i get some pointers on what to focus the writing on?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
