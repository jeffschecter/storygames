I also published a game called Hierarchy that was playtested with 12 people.  <br><br>For Ember Twilight, familiarity with the mechanics as vitally important- especially during combat.  As the GM, I had been playtesting the game for 5 years, so I knew it in and out.  The other players picked it up quickly, so there was little lag time during combat.  Spotlight sharing wasn't too much of a problem.  I made sure that I proposed situations where every character, sooner or later, whould have a chance to shine.  There were also about three people who were natural leaders in our group, so they took things over when necessary.  Though, I think, some players were marginalized at times.  If I had it to do all over, I would have topped the group out at five or six instead.<br/><br/>In Hierarchy, the game breaks everyone out into pairs for most of the roleplaying.  It worked for me and my group because, again, we knew the mechanics so well.  However, I don't believe the game was very well written, and so duplicating those epxeriences would be very difficult in my mind.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303316/#Comment_303316" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T12:31:30+00:00" title="December  5, 2010 12:31PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jumanji83</cite>What was the largest number of players you've had in a functional game, what game was it, and how did you make it work.</blockquote>\nI've never been in a game with more than five players that I would describe as fun, let alone functional.

It was interesting to talk to Eppy about why the awesome session of Swords Without Masters he ran at Anonycon required three players and was capped at 4, and a good comparison because that yielded a crack-like essence of the sword &amp; sorcery pulp goodness I enjoy in old-school D&amp;D.; My take-away was that Swords requires a group mind to create the fictional space, and races through it at the speed of thought; you can't get good consensus on the tone and grok the essence of other people's characters if you have too many minds pulling in different directions, and explaining and playing the game took less than three hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy OD&amp;D; games for big groups use a dungeon to create the fictional space, the canon of '70s D&amp;Dness; to set the tone, and we crawl through it at the speed of graph paper; six to eight hours of play, lots of joking around. Like ndp says it works because the mechanics are super low handling, because the "it's your turn, here's the dire situation, what do you do?" lets everyone step up about equally and ideally there are lots of different things to do to impact the situation or die trying, and because we have a clear endpoint (when the session ends you need to leave the dungeon, preferably laden with treasure).<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a group this big the focus is necessarily on exploration - where will we go in the external world, how can we integrate what we find there with what we know already, how can we use what we find to survive and get rich - with character emerging only through individual actions and reactions, or not. We do more personal stuff via carousing - a hybrid play-by-post where individual players describe how their characters seek to gain XP by spending their gold on things that matter to them, which shows us what they care about and sets up situations that feed into the action of the next group descent into danger. I think it's noteworthy that I've started using Apocalypse World moves for this essentially one-on-one aspect of the game, while finding that standard OD&amp;D; rules work great at-the-big-table (aided by procedures instead of rules for individual narration, like "describe how you kill this guy" - the art gallery session where <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/improv-techniques-made-art-gallery-gaming-awesome/" rel="nofollow">I talked about these procedures</a> had something like 15 players at once.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of GM-advice things I more or less give up on with a group this size, including scene framing - pacing happens through social negotiation between the over-eager and the over-cautious - but I find that some of the most enjoyable and surprising moments in this kind of play come from things that I wouldn't have thought worth framing a scene around anyway, like "gee I didn't realize you're four gold pieces short on that boat your plan requires, what will you do to earn the money?" or "hmm a wandering monster arrived en route to where we thought the action is, but it turns out to reincorporate something more interesting".<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this style is not for everyone, but that in a big group this is less of a problem; it's easy for me to accomodate a steady flux of new players, and in fact that is as much the reason why I wound up playing this way as is wanting to follow the OD&amp;D; dictum "At least one referee and from four to fifty players can be handled in any single campaign, but the referee to player ratio should be about 1:20 or thereabouts." (I know now that that probably meant a situation like New York Red Box has now, where two recurring referees plus occasional ones run <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thealexandrian.net/archive/archive2009-03b.html" rel="nofollow">open table</a> games for a floating shared pool of maybe 10-15 regulars and 20-25 occasionals and one-time drop-ins; the campaign that meets more often than mine also has a smaller average group size, maybe 4-8).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303357/#Comment_303357" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T20:22:24+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  8:22PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Biggest game I had was a 12 players take on oWoD Vampire's "The last Supper". I actually served as supplemental GM to the main organizer. While the experience seems to be remembered fondly, that's not something I'd do again, especially for such a conversation focused scenario. It was a real strain, and felt more like work than gaming on my part.<br><br>Alone I think the most players I had was 8 players, for an Ambre diceless game. I think the game does this really well. It being low on rules helped a lot.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
