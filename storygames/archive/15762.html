Dragon*Con isn't the place to attract casual interest.<br/><br/>So what if we re-brand what we're doing?<br/><br/>What if, we say "Learn to make the most out of conflict."  or "Learn to make relate-able characters" or "Learn to improv faster" or somesuch, and then provide players with the games to do so.  Offer commentary when appropriate.  Talk about how the game is making you work a certain way, highlight what the players are doing themselves.<br/><br/>It's already a soft-sell for the game(s) in question, but better still, it might actually <i>attract</i> people from other zones of the con.  It's better than a panel because people can actually get involved, and you're showing, not telling.<br/><br/>And even if they don't wind up buying the game you are pitching, they might go home and game differently next time.  They might think a little deeper about what they're doing.</blockquote>\nAm I a raving madman?

Here's an option that I'll totally run at the next con I go to with panels:<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Pressing World Crisis</b><br/><br/>When people come through the door, give them a little index card that says "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What This Is</span>: This is an interactive game. You're a member of the press. Your job is to ask questions about a pressing world crisis. Make them up, and be weird if you want to! Questions don't need to relate to one another, necessarily. If you ask a question that stumps the speaker, they'll turn the question over to one of their "staff" who's on the stage. If that happens, your role changes! You come onto the stage, and sit where the staff-in-waiting sit."<br/><br/>Stand at the podium, as if this were a press conference. Get 3 audience volunteers to come on stage and stand behind you, stage right.<br/><br/>Begin by raising your hands, as if to quell the loud stirrings of the crowd, and say, "Now, esteemed ladies and gentlemen of the press, and other guests, let me assure you that this issue is being treated with the utmost seriousness by this office. We intend to find a solution to this (admittedly inexplicable and intricate) issue as quickly as possible. While we don't have all of the answers yet, your questions are welcome."<br/><br/>Someone will bite, and ask a question. Maybe about Godzilla. Maybe about all the missing peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. (Have a planted questioner in the audience, just in case nobody bites at first.) Answer the question as matter-of-factly and seriously as you possibly can. Don't play it for laughs - that's the audience's job.<br/><br/>When you get a question that you can't come up with a good answer to, or you're ready to pass the spotlight role on, say, "I'm afraid that I can't speak to that issue directly, but I'll take this opportunity to turn the microphone over to my [Official Job Title,] [Name.]" The next staff person (person standing on the side of the stage) now takes your place, and you go have a seat in the crowd. The person who asked the stumping question comes up and joins the end of the staff line-up. Play proceeds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This would be a great game for fostering improv skills, world-building skills, and just getting your sillies out. It'd prime people for indie games. At 55 minutes, take the stage again and say, "That's all the time we have for this press conference, but I'd like to inform you about a few other projects that our department has initiated." Then break character and pitch your friendly local Indie Hurricane / Games on Demand / Indie Track.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357620/#Comment_357620" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T12:57:05+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 12:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh.

The only limitation is how few people you can run through at one time 6-8 per table.  But what if we had an area were you would be running it as a series of 1 hour panels to give more people a chance to participate (then of course there is the issue of how to pick who).

Here was my pitch:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Devising Plays: Collaborative Storytelling and Character Construction<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Saturday 29 October, we'llbe running an afternoon session on Devising Plays: Collaborative Storytelling and Character Construction. Starting with the basics of creative collaboration, we will look to explore different methods of constructing characters, their objectives, their interweaving relationships and the overall premise of a story. We will then take these and expand them into a complete storyline through collaborative narration and touch on how these basic storylines could then be developed into a devised play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis session is for people who are looking for a chance to practise their storytelling, collaborate on a creating ideas within a group and are interested in devising plays in general.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe actual content, in fact, was based around narrative story game techniques (as I believe there's a lot that can be learnt from story games to help with devising plays).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo:<br/>\n- It began with an introduction to collaborative narration<br/>\n- then I had an introduction to collaboration in competitive scenarios<br/>\n- I introduced them to the scenario and characters for Love in the Time of Seid<br/>\n- we created a couple more characters (as we had 7 actors the first time round)<br/>\n- we did a round of Seid so everyone got a chance to narrate a scene<br/>\n- then the bulk of the workshop was about character/scenario creation using different approaches to determine which approach worked best<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen their developing characters for a play, actors always make them their own, even when the characters were written by someone else. Normally, this involves reading the script and answering lengthy questionnaires about the character's history, their opinions, their routine, their feelings towards others and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found in narrative games that all this really wasn't that necessary. Playing <i>The Mountain Witch</i> for the first time, I found that my ronin had a secret fear and decided that he had lost his master in a previous attempt to defeat the witch, and I really didn't need to know anything more about him to be able to play that character in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the workshop we tried these different ways of creating characters &amp; the overall scenario:<br/>\n- Creation through relationships (essentially <i>Fiasco</i>)<br/>\n- Creation through story fragments (essentially<i> In A Wicked Age</i>)<br/>\n- Creation through inspiration (something I'd previously used where you take a picture or card and create a character from what the image conveys to you and then work out how they're related)<br/>\n- Creation through questioning (classic theatrical hotseating)<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran it twice (which was as many times as needed for our group) having 7 actors the first time and 3 (because of transport breakdowns) the second. Running time was about 6 hours but a lot of this was taken up by actually generating the settings rather than by simply explaning the techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be doing another couple in a month which will focus on differing approaches to collaborative narration so that we can move from a starting scenario to complete story (essentially playing out a basic story game).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in response to the OP, I found that rebranding worked for actors. We went through the entire workshop without mentioning rpgs or story games as we were focused on some of the methods that underpin all group storytelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of rebranding for D&amp;D; gamers and the like, some thoughts on topics could be:<br/>\n- Character creation - this can be quicker and better for both PCs and NPCs. Give me stats, I'll play a game. Give me a dream and secret and I'll play a character.<br/>\n- Painting a scene - with no, or little, dice rolling narrative games as the name suggests focus on the narrating. There's a huge amount of colourful description of both the environment and the character's actions and interactions. Such 'scene-painting' is good no matter the game system.<br/>\n- Quicker resolutions - showing that quicker resolution mechanics can still be exciting (tie in better descriptions) and the quicker the mechanic, the smaller a break in the storyflow and the greater the plot momentum and the immersion. I know the "how do I play a game without dice?" was a big mental obstacle for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_357722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357722/#Comment_357722" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T02:14:04+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  2:14AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Harlequin</cite>Am I a raving madman?

The scenario is handed to you on a plate so there shouldn't be much flailing around or concern that you don't know what you should be doing.<br/>\n- It's completely out in the open, so there's nothing happening behind the scenes that might confuse you<br/>\n- It's diceless<br/>\n- You've got sharing the power with Events and Theme guides<br/>\n- You're all building on each other's stories so there's active listening<br/>\n- It's Active Narrator, i.e. the active player (the one who's turn it is) describes a scene spotlighting his character. Why is this a factor for me? It means that as I'm listening to people I get to plan ahead as to what I want my spotlight scene to be, which is quite comforting. On my turn I'm not going to be suddenly thrown a scene that I don't know how to handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to go full on with 'Sharing the power' then you could consider something like a stripped down version of Archipelago. You couldn't do a full game, but you could do a few scenes emphasising the story element ownership side. You could even set it in a classic dungeon crawl environment so the players are comfortable with the setting their describing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor building interlocking characters, you can't get much better than <i>Fiasco </i>IMO. Just doing the set-up is a game in itself. With an appropriate playset, you could demonstrate how 'classic' rpg PC parties can be made more exciting when you add details to the PCs relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so clear on the lesson for Making Conflict Matter though. What's the technique you're wanting to convey here?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, there's a really clear different concept, the comforting prescence of dice and a GM, but again the game encourages the GM to have the players contribute. A critical part of it is that the GM doesn't know the Dark Fate and so it is encumbent on the player to introduce and develop it. When I played it, the GM was very good with offering the players the chance to add description both to locations and to the enemies we encountered. I think it's an excellent bridge game, but difficult to do it justice in a single slot though especially as the combat rules do take some explaining.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jason">@Jason</a><br/>\nThe outcomes were split for the first session, the 'creation through relationship' <i>Fiasco </i>approach really enthused several of them. I think because once the set-up was completed it was really clear what the potential of the story was and what the plot drivers were. The resulting plot was a typical Fiasco affair involving the CEO of a pharmaceutical giant being investigated by an undercover reporter while at the same time his estranged son tried to prove his worth in the Costa Rican rap scene, while the son's parole officer and her girlfriend, an accountant at the pharmaceutical company, were out to embezzle from the firm and there was a justice of the peace mixed up in it somehow and illegal obtained court documents floating around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found 'creation through story fragments' really interesting as they came up with a scenario set in 1930s New England where the daughter of a local mayor is possessed by the spirit of a witch-finder from the 17th century at the same time that a lust-filled pseudo-psycharist arrived in town with his nurse who was horrifically scarred during a gas attack during the war. The child's governess was the central character, determined to protect her from all the malovent characters around her. I thought it all had potential, but the actors fed-back that they were just trying to piece together an existing story rather than creating a new story from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe remainder of the actors preferred the 'creation through inspiration' (we ran out of time to do 'creation through questioning'). That scenario ended up being set in the French Revolution and revolving around an imprisoned nobleman, a mid-level bureaucrat in the new regime, the bureaucrat's renegade teenage daughter who ran of gang of violent revolutionary youths, who in turn were hiding the nobleman's son who was dressed up as a girl. The rest of the actors preferred this approach as they felt that they were bringing a lot more of their own creativity to the process. (Though this may be a more critical concern to actors rather than gamers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second group strongly preferred the 'creation through questioning' approach, however. Again because of the sense that they were creating the story from scratch rather than trying to pull together elements already provided to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I've used 'creation through inspiration' exclusively in the past, I actually prefer 'creation through questioning' over it as it feels like a far more of a 'group' creation because the character creator is getting their ideas from the group's questions rather than just staring at an image on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still think, though, that 'creation through relationships' has a lot to offer in ensuring that character's agendas are targeted squarely against each other. The problem with the French Revolution scenario was, while everyone loved what we'd created, no one could think of how the story would actually develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is crucial for me in devising plays as, unlike in straightforward narration, I want to have one character per actor and so the stories must therefore look inward (i.e. have the primary agendas, obstacles, opportunities etc within the group) rather than outward. The narrators can't just create new secondary characters as part of the story because there wouldn't be anyone to play them!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of future incorporation, this was a one-off workshop for these particular actors - and I think most came to help with their own writing rather than reincorporating it into their approach to acting. I think it could certainly help with visualisation and improvisation, as both improv and story games share the same essential basics of building a story in collaboration with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real benefit of the workshops were to help determine which approach actors prefer (and which lead to the best stories, not necessarily the same thing) so that I can then reincorporate it into devised theatrical pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run an annual programme where a group of actors get together (a different group each time) and, starting with nothing, no characters, no plot, no setting, nothing, create an entire play together, rehearse it, then perform it - all over the course of about 60 hours rehearsal time. I've run it three times already and have always been happy with the result, but recently came to think that I could improve the process by which we generate the ideas in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe work under pretty heavy time constraints. About half the 60 hours is taken up by actually rehearsing the final script, 4 hours goes to introduction, 16 hours to generating improvise the scenes for the scenario we've actually chosen, so that leaves only about 10 hours to generate as many different scenarios as we could and give them a go.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we did before was suggest a setting, each actor would then use 'creation through inspiration' to develop a character for that setting. I'd then work out how those characters relate to each other and set a scene that would include them. The actors would then improvise that scene (or a couple of scenes). After we worked through all the settings, we'd then make the choice as to which one we wanted to carry forwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has worked out okay in the past, but<br/>\n- we only get a brief taste of that particular scenario to judge it on<br/>\n- actors naturally gravitate and work best in settings closest to their own experience, leading us to producing primarily 'kitchen sink' domestic dramas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all well and good and very Mike Leigh, but I want them to be able to tell different kinds of stories as well. I don't see any reason why you couldn't devise a decent fantasy, sf or historical play instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I run it over the summer I'll be incorporating what I've learned from story games, have the actors active in developing the scenario (as opposed to just their character) and have them explore the scenario through a story-game style collaborative narration, giving us a better idea of the potential of the story than just improvising a single scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first workshops did the scenario creation, then the second set I'm running in March will focus on different methods of handling the narration (e.g. rotating narrator like <i>Sei\xf0</i>, rotating director, split responsibility like <i>Fiasco</i>, questioning like <i>Durance </i>(appreciate all these different methods by the way Jason! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/>\n<br/>\nThen over the summer I'll be able to roll out the next devised piece and put it all into practice with a new group of folks and see what comes out of it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357899/#Comment_357899" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T13:34:10+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  1:34PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will have to check these games out.

Real live people (maybe even you) will be sitting at the table, actually playing a game (maybe even one you play), and we'll be providing feedback to get the players and the audience thinking about getting what they want at the table.<br><br>Also, you'll get to meet some great game masters and learn what games they are running right here at DragonCon, so you can get first hand experience with them throughout the convention.  Each has their own style, but they all offer the insight to help you find your flavor and pursue it.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nDoes this hit any marks?  If it was worded this way, would any of you be interested?<br><br>Then after the panel, interested people can find the GMs mentioned abive in their regularly scheduled games, OR schedule a customized workshop over in Non-Campaign RPG, for the price of a regularly scheduled game, to work with them for 4 hours and give them another perspective.<br><br>[[I'm still planning on using my "game slots" to run workshop games anyways, and marketing them as such.]]<br><br>I don't feel like it's the ideal scenario, I mean, I'd much rather just have a room with three or four tables and some staff-members to cycle through, but this is the Alpha phase and proof of concept.<br><br>Please be (brutally) honest with feedback.  I want this to work.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
