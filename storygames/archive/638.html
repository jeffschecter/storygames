                    bq. The player picks up the dice, "I want to roll dice to discover that he is fucking lying!"<br/>
<br/>
In a different "incredibly productive":http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=614 discussion, this came up.  And it got me wondering: in Nar heavy games with the whole conflict resolution thang, this might be within the scope of the game as written.  The ultimate extension of this sort of reasoning is "nuh-uh, cuz I'll roll higher than you."[1]  <br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, I'm awestruck by the flexibility and agency afforded to ??Donjon?? style "he's lying."  That's cool.  At the same time, I can see a couple of decent arguments against allowing it wholesale.<br/>
<br/>
* The result can be very silly, since most narrative decisions are made in the moment.  Rather than there being a shining plot thread, the story follows the thread of a herd of cats.<br/>
<br/>
* Barring particularly masochistic play,[2] play becomes very much about wish-fulfillment.  There's a different, equally interesting story that comes out of "he's telling the god's honest truth."  <br/>
<br/>
* Finally, what's the GM doing in a game where you can roll dice to make statements false?  On some level I see an analogy to PC de-protagonism.  If you're character is "your guy" and there's a line in the sand around him, then doesn't the GM have an equivalent line?  If not, why not play sans GM?  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but my humble self sees a conflict between "roll to make him be lying" and GM agency.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
fn1. Dress it up as "I want to roll to disbelieve the illusion."<br/>
<br/>
fn2. I might even argue "advanced" story-play, _a la_ the example from ??Polaris:?? "**But only** if my character dies."                </div>

bq. Hope that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
It certainly does.  My thoughts weren't meant as a definite credo whatsoever.  I just think that there's a traditional path of "areas of authority" that draws lines between what players can do and influence, and what the GM can, and that "I roll to disbelieve the lies" runs roughshod over that -- but that it's by no means the only way to structure play.<br/>

I suspect I agree with you, but could you elaborate on that?                        </div>

                            Here's the thing, I come to the table with nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I look at the players, they have their Keys (which in 1st Quest are called Banners) written on index cards so I, and all of the other players, can see them at all times.  So, when I look out at the table, I am seeing what excites each player about their situation and about their character and how they have chosen to accrue XP.  <br/>
<br/>
What excites my players is staring me in the face for the entire game.<br/>
<br/>
This has reduced my prep to next to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I can see with some traditional GMing where you come in with an idea for a plot and when it is de-railed, suddenly set pieces and such are wasted.  But when we play Dogs in the Vineyard, that is what the town is, one big set piece, an adventure I made up and the players walk on in and do what needs doing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where I am going with this.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if anything occurs to you based on what I just wrote.                        </div>

                            Funny enough, when I GM, the italicized items are usually not a big part of my powers. If they are part of it at all. <br/><br/>Establishing boundaries of imaginary content is a maybe. I do it, but so do the players. I've had players "NO SILLY!" me Once Upon A Time style more than once, and had players do the same to each other without me. When you have a group that is all together on the same page, that one becomes something the whole group can do. If any one person is more in charge of it than others, it tends to be the person with the most tightly realized vision of the world. Same deal with Authority over internal plausibility. I don't see myself as GM having any more say in that than the other players at the table. <br/><br/>Back-story creation is a tricky one. There are a few ways that I go about this these days. In a game where I set things up, such as Dogs or Conspiracy of Shadows, I certainly am in charge of back-story creation. But those games, more and more, have a backstory that is only focused on creating situation for the players to FUBAR. So when the players come in and want to add or change something to the back-story that will not reduce the tension of the situation, I usually let them without thinking about it. The negotiation and systems come full into play when I'm not sure what the result of doing so would be. <br/><br/>But, as Judd said, there is also a lot of my gaming these days that either doesn't have a preset backstory (Agora, Shock!, Polaris, With Great Power) or has a backstory that is set by the group as a whole (PTA games, Burning Wheel, AG&amp;G, Exalted the way my group plays it) or the game in a focused way (Mountain Witch). <br/><br/>Authority over what information can be acted upon by which characters is something that I used to do. I know I used to do that. So I know that people do just that. But when I read those words now and think about it in GM terms, it makes my eyes cross as though I'm reading some strange message in an alien tongue. If there is information out there, its out there so that people can use it how they want to use it to author their story or step on up to their challange. I can't think of a situation in the last 3 years of GMing where I have ever disallowed a character to have or act upon information that was avaliable to the group.<br/><br/>Of course, there are also several of those non italiced items that make my eyes cross the same way. Or more.                        </div>

                            I think I see very mich where you're going.  What I'd like to get at is this: in the traditional sense, there are clearly defined boundaries of agency.  Like in ??Dogs?? if the first NPC the PCs meet says "Terrible things have been happening!  The Steward kilt his middle wife, and the owner of the General Store is running a coven!  You have to help us!" and the players say "We want to roll to have him be lying about all that" there goes the set piece.  ??Dogs?? relies on those boundries.  And they're a very common, very well understood structure of play.<br/>
<br/>
But what you're describing in ??First Quest??[1] sounds not completely unique, and certainly not wrong or infeasbile.  But certainly based on a different convention of play.  And I'm interested in what that convention is, and how it works, because from Boundries World, it looks fraught with peril.  But my limited experience with it is that it work fine, and works better if players are reaching into each other's agency and messing with it.<br/>
<br/>
My instinctual image is that in a boundries game, you draw circles around the players and around the GM, and inside your circle is your domain, and outside the circles is sort of international waters.  I'm pretty comfortable with this image, from long experience.  By contrast, I almost envision lines draw between each player in the sort of game you're describing, but I'm still fuzzy on how the narrative direction works.<br/>
<br/>
**Vaxalon**<br/>
<br/>
I'd add "Provide adversity," "Conflict creation," and "Play NPCs" as being dependant on the GM being the absolute arbiter of truth in a more traditional game.  If a player response to adversity ("Can I see you license and registration, please, sir?") is to disbelieve ("I want to notice that his badge is a fake.") the PCs have to admit adversity.   And I think that NPCs are the clearest analogue to PC sanctity.  The statements that you might make about the GM making statements inside the PC boundry ("If I roll a 3 or better, you love him, you love him utterly.") apply pretty equally to the NPC boundry ("If I roll a 3 or better, he's a space alien in disguise.")[2]<br/>
<br/>
And I'm interested in how that whole list is supported by without a central authority on "what is true" in the game.  I'm not proposing that there's no other possible support, but I admit my ignorance about what it could be, and my curiousity about it.<br/>
<br/>
fn1. Is there a link or something regarding ??First Quest???  I'd like to read it, if it's possible.<br/>
<br/>
fn2. And it becomes suddenly clear how to write a Phil Dick RPG.                        </div>

                            Judson, <br/><br/>I think a lot of my play even in games with GMs has been changed by playing GMless games. Once you've had enough good experience in games that work without a GM, it really changes your ideas of what "must" be in a game. Once past that, it's all a matter of what you want to get the game you want, rather than what the inherent focus of play should be. <br/><br/>(Your example of Dogs is right on, btw. Dogs does need the GM to have control of the backstory in order to keep the peice set. Dogs cannot change what happened. However, that is because of the very particular way that Dogs approaches story, conflict, and judgement.) <br/><br/>Agora, Shock!, and Polaris don't have GMs -- and yet my experience with all of them is coherent play with sustained fiction. That bleeds over into my play of even so traditional a game as Exalted, in which our players regularly make up whole facets of the world and game background.                        </div>

<p>The GM looks like a whole different role if, instead of saying "GM is responsible for X, and must therefore be given 110% of the power that could even conceivably be needed to establish X" you say "GM has X as a goal, and is given the following tools, which give him a sporting chance of achieving X, even in the face of a player who wants to do Y."</p>
<p>"Remove the GM agency" ... it doesn't ring true to me.  That's like saying a player in Exalted has no "agency" to kick ass.  They've got huge agency to kick ass, they just have to do it (and sometimes fail to do it) through the game system.</p>

                            Bringing things back to the original example, I'd handle that by exerting MY agency to decide what the NPC is lying about.  Everyone lies for all kinds of social reasons.  I wouldn't regard a challenge of "Liar!" as a way of players getting to say, "The opposite of what he said it's true."  I would read it more as a statement of, "Oooh, juicy, make this more complicated," or as a statement of, "Nope, not that, try something else," depending on the social context.  <br/><br/>I'm perfectly happy to give the players agency in the game, and some degree of authority over the setting and the NPCs, but when it comes down to it, if I'm acting as a GM then I have to be able to run a plot effectively for them.  That means that I have to have some kind of mental model of what's going on in the story.  If the players say, "He's lying!" then I'll choose a way for him to be lying which inspires me to make good plot for them.<br/><br/>(Of course, as we discussed in the other thread, my players almost <i>never</i> consider that someone might be lying.  But a girl can dream!)<br/><br/>Since folks seem to be discussing it, I'll add that we're sharing the role of "authority over internal plausibility" with players, with multiple GMs, and also with someone who isn't actually a player or a GM.  We've got a dedicated scribe for our Rome game; if you don't register your actions with her, they never happened, and she's our repository of all wisdom about, "Who did what, when, and what did it mean?"  She has a huge amount of authority over the fictional world we've created - and at the same time she has very little authority in other ways, in that if she exerts that authority in ways that upset the rest of the group, she could be removed from the group without destroying the game.<br/><br/>I think that games can share these things in very complicated ways, particularly when you consider that the final expression of autonomy is in, "Screw this!"  The person (or people) who is most necessary to the group is ultimately the final arbiter of authority, since they can threaten to nuke the game, though they might or might not be the GM.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

We handled what you were talking about through Stakes Setting.<br/>
<br/>
So, Joe said, "If I win I realize that he is lying about my mother's death."<br/>
<br/>
"And if you lose, you buy it and believe that your died, Amidala-style, of grief when you and your sister ran away all those years ago."<br/>
<br/>
That father was an abusive alchoholic jerk who had beaten one of the PC's in game.  Oy.  Intense.<br/>
<br/>
So, if Joe had said, "If I win my dad is lying," but we had already established that NPC as a decent guy, we would've had to negotiate quite a bit more and figure it out.  I'd want to know why Joe wanted that and what he wanted out of it.                        </div>

                            Jess, I don't want to derail but I'm very curious in your group's "dedicated scribe". Is this a full player? Someone without a PC but with other means of introducing elements to the fiction? Or a pure onlooker? If I'm opening wormcans, do split/whisper/whatever.                        </div>

                            Judd: very interesting.  I think we do a lot of implicit stakes setting without really talking about it, but I'd never thought about it that way.  I like your way of handling it and I could totally get behind that.<br/><br/>Alex: our scribe is someone who joined the gaming group long after we ran out of room for more players in our Rome game, but really wanted to be involved.  We'd already been struggling with tracking the course of the story and maintaining internal plausibility, so when she volunteered to come to sessions, hang out, take notes, look things up, etc., we were bloody thrilled.  She doesn't have any direct way of introducing elements to the fiction, mostly because that's the whole reason she's scribing instead of playing in the first place, but she's almost a meta-GM.  The multiple GMs (in our tabletop game) will do things like run our plans by her to make sure they make sense, find out whether other players and GMs are doing things that would interfere, or just check in that she thinks it would be cool.  So she has this weird mediated influence.  I've also found that the players really want to do awesome things so that she bounces and says that they're awesome when it comes time to report, record, and write things down.  Immediate feedback is kind of like crack!<br/><br/>Back at you with the split/whisper thing; this doesn't seem like a wormcan to me, but I've gotten into crazy extended discussions of stuff that seems totally natural to me before.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<br/>
Well, I think you can play with a GM in situations where you want the things that a more traditional, GM and Players game can get you.  There is a certain joy to Participationism - and some people do genuinely love Illusionist play.  <br/>
<br/>
I tend to think, and I might be wrong, that Immersion tends to be better served by a GM than by the GM's absence - it's easier to identify with a character when you share some of his ignorance.  <br/>
<br/>
But, if you are looking for a lot of narrative agency for the players, then the difference between GM and player does begin to soften, and in thsoe circumstances, I'm right beside you.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, it's just a difference in the purpose and direction of the game.                        </div>

                            Hmm.  I REALLY want a GM, even when I have a lot of agency as a player and character, because I want someone whose job it is to make things up that make me go, "Oooh awesome!"  That doesn't have to be a single person; I'm happy for the role to be shared or rotated or whatever.  I just find that I want to be able to point to someone and say, "Hey!  Be hardcore for me!" in ways beyond what the dice or conflict points or whatever dictate.  It's an attention thing, to some extent: who is responsible for my HARDCORE???!?!?<br/><br/>I think that at some level we may be arguing terminology; most of the GM functions have to be taken up by someone.  "GM-less" games still begin and end scenes, interpret rules, have a consistent shared world, etc.  It's just that those functions don't belong exclusively to one person.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>Other than that, I mostly agree with judson.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<br/>
And being that I agree with your "that," I think we just agree.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that traditional "gamemaster this side, players over there" play makes the "hardcore" easier to do.  I've seen how in less centralized games, there can be a whole lot of fun to giving and getting hardcore in every direction, and I'd like to see a game that fascilitates that better.  Every once in a while I'll get the opportunity to pass a little piece of narrative on to another player that I want to add "Check." to the end of, but I find that so far that's always been something the system discouraged or was neutral towards.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, there are a bunch of tasks that must[1] be done for a game to keep going, to flow smoothly, and usually they're all piled on the gamemaster, but absent a GM, those tasks either get parcelled out to the players (explicitly in the game text or spoken play contract, or implicitly in the course of play) or they're neglected to the detriment of the game.<br/>
<br/>
fn1. It occurs to me that "there are tasks that must be performed in a role playing game" is a pretty strong statement, and while I stand by it, defending it might be interesting.                        </div>

<br/>
Right, and I'd argue that the "**She** does it" end of that dichotomy is relatively well understood, but that we're still in early days of understanding how "**we** do it" works.  I also think that by saying "the gamemaster's job is..." you get a lot for free, that as a designer you need to replace when you decide not to have a gamemaster.<br/>
<br/>
I think that replacement happens anyway, but it seems like there's something to be gotten by explicitly treating that issue, rather than leaving it to be handled _ad hoc._                        </div>

                            Here's a REAL tangent: maybe one of the things we'll get out of this discussion, then, is a better understanding of what we need to incorporate into games aimed at people who don't know much about role-playing.  If the games we're making really do include all these assumptions when we talk about "The GM's job is . . ." then knowing what they are can free us up to talk about them in ways appropriate to the audience for a particular game of ours.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess: definately.  One of the hallmarks of the quasi-freeform games that magically showed up in the late 80's and early 90's (Amber, OTE, Everway, etc) was that they required basically no skilll or experience on the part of the players...but did so in a way that apparently put all the burden of skill and experience on the GM (I say apparently because it's clear now, at least, that while you -can- easily teach new players to play one of these games, that good players will take a lot of the weight from the GM).<br/>
<br/>
A GM-less game isn't necessarily as immediately accessable as a well-run GM-centrist game, but it demands a lot less from any given player, evens out the participation even among inexperienced players, and may (depending on...a lot) be more satisfying overall.                        </div>

                            Ben, the jaded old fogies read the <i>Amber/Everway</i> school as strongly advocating "GM fiat."  Hence, accessible and quazi-freeform (in that there are no mechanics you really need to know besides "respect the GM").  So the only player skill necessary is on the part of the GM.  Is that more within your experience?                        </div>

                            Dammit my brain forgot to consolidate this thread. Sorry Jess. It would be really interesting to sit in on one of your sessions, because I find it hard to wrap my head around  a role that has GM-like responsibilities without GM/Player-like input. I can sort of get the mediated influence, as if she is the status quo of the game world, but I can't imagine such a role being rewarding <i>in the kind of game I'm playing</i>. It makes me think of a split between amateurs getting together and having fun for themselves alone, and pros preparing and performing for a wider audience - but I don't know if this is a fair characterisation either.                        </div>

                            Alex: she seems to have a good time - but I do know that she'd rather be playing.  We just don't currently have room in our group for one more.  (Actually, we have a waiting list.  And four or five regular spectators.)  What she says she enjoys is knowing everything that's going on, which the GMs don't, and being able to make connections that we haven't even thought of because we don't know all the facts involved.  She gets to giggle a lot, which often makes me run over shouting, "What?  What?  I want to be HARDCORE!!!!"  Giggling is a good sign of HARDCORE opportunity.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also, on the fiat/freeform game, I've gotta side with Ben here.  I think that playing freeform takes an immense amount of, well, <i>something</i>.  I don't know if I'd call it skill, precisely, but at the very least the person who is playing needs to be willing to be open, participatory, playful, aware of the story, engaged, etc.  Even the most fiatty GM can't do much with a player who sits there and shrugs every time they're offered plot, and learning how to have fun in a role-playing game (fiatted or not) is definitely a skill as well.  There's a guy in Australia who's actually looking at what personality characteristics make it likely that you will enjoy this kind of experience, but I can't remember his name offhand.  If someone's interested in his research, ping me and I'll see if I can find it once finals are over.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Is it just me, or is the disagreement about quasi-freeform being easier a matter of perspective?  It seems like the essential point is agreed on: that the game requirement is to respect the GM and learn to love the fiat.<br/>
<br/>
That the is-easier position seems to be that that puts a lot of responsibility on the GM to correct for player error, keep things moving, invent everything, draw players in.  And that all the players need to do is be able to relax and enjoy, as well as going along; that players who can't do that will get zero enjoyment and drift away.  So the argument seems to be that, for the right temperment, there's very little _skill_ required of a player.<br/>
<br/>
And the isn't-easier position seems to be that the ability to relax and enjoy someone elses plot, and go along with the GM fiat, isn't a natural thing, or is otherwise difficult to stomach.  This argument seems to be that (even if there is such a thing as the right temperment) for someone of the wrong temperment, no amount of skill will avoid the difficulty of quasi-freeform play.<br/>
<br/>
Is that an accurate summation?  Or have I misunderstood everyone?                        </div>

                            Judston, eta alia, a few things:<br/>
<br/>
1. The games I listed were never the style of (and never advocated the style of) GM Fiat that involves everyone following the GM's plot.  OTE has players create core campaign elements at creation (and has some really cool "narativism/participationism disguised as adversity" essays), Amber has players create large amounts of the played setting; Everway explictly involves the GM setting up a situation for the players to deal with rather than a "plot."<br/>
<br/>
2. The games are demonstrably very new-player friendly, given a competent GM.  This is largely because the skills required are those many people already have, and those they don't can be learned in play.  This doesn't mean they're good for all players; they're not, and a mismanaged bad player can ruin the experience (and a bad fiat GM -will- ruin the experience).<br/>
<br/>
I agree that playing freeform well long term requires a bit of...something.  But that doesn't mean it's not new player friendly -- surface simplicity doesn't mitigate against depth.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a distinction between "player skill" and "player experience?"<br/>
<br/>
Note that the initial post Ben was responding to talked about how it -apparently- requires no player skill (but that, in fact, good/experienced players take a lot of the burden off the GM, and make it a lot less of "the GM does all the heavy lifting, or the group disintegrates in a bang or whimper").<br/>
<br/>

                            Yeah, Judson, I can't say I agree with "learn to love the fiat" either, though never having played Amber or Everway, I'm at a bit of a disadvantage in this discussion.  (I'm keeping an eye on eBay, though!)<br/><br/>mneme, I think what you're getting at is the idea that some games are more responsive to skills that ordinary people are likely to have - like being able to let go of their inhibitions and pretend - as opposed to specific skills of how to play a role-playing game.  Just from looking at the "player skills" thread, I see that a lot of what we do are things that people might know from other contexts, especially if they like to read or watch movies or play games or just daydream a lot.  Using those skills is a good way for players to participate without feeling like they're necessarily "playing a role-playing game" and learning skills they don't yet have.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess, I'm local (though with Columbia out of session, I'm not up there every Friday any more).  Can lend you Everway (would have to talk to Lisa to lend Amber, though).<br/>

re skills, yes, exactly.  In a "strong GM" quasi-freeform game, the players come in and use skills they will often already have.  But in the same games, there's a teriffic burden on the GM, who is using those skills but -also- a variety of other ones, often ones that are hard to get outside of roleplaying.  In a more distributed freeform (ie, no GM or very weak GM), the requirement to have these skills is distributed a bit (though you can still have 3 players who are stepping into more GM-like roles and one who is still getting her feet wet), but in some ways, the bar is raised in general.                        </div>

                            Ben, appreciating opera seems more like a habit than a skill.  It's something that, if you do it enough, you become socialized to the whole procedure and get better at understanding.  I guess you could argue that you get better at it and enjoy it more through practicing, but is that because your skills are really increasing or because it's just becoming familiar and ritualized?  Probably a mixture of both.  And I imagine the same is true of most forms of roleplaying.                        </div>

                            Ben: of course.  But let's take fencing vs riding bikes.  You can ride a bike -- and even enjoy it -- after one, maybe two lessons learning how things work.  Sure, you'll get a lot better if you ride a lot, but really...wheels, balance, trust; once you get it, you can stay on a bike and probably enjoy it -- many of the skills transfer over from other things you do, just not all of them.  Now fencing, on the other hand -- give someone a weapon, teach them a few moves, and, well, they're still not fencing -- they're just flailing around with a weapon. Moveover, unless they're a genius with talent in exactly the right area, if they keep flailing around like that, they're -still- not going to be fencing, or at least, not for a very long time, and with many, many false starts.  In fact, many serious fencing masters/teachers won't let someone free fence for a long-ish time of just doing drills and learning what kinds of moves they should even be trying -- maybe even a year.<br/>
<br/>
Some things, you can just dive right into, using what you know from other activities until you get better at the skills specialized to this new thing.  Other things, though, you really want to make baby steps so you aren't spending half your time messing up, and the other unlearning things you shouldn't have learned in the first place.                        </div>

<br/>
Um, Ben?  I have to say that your understanding of a skill and mine are radically different.  To my mind, a skill is an active proficiency.  Meaning, it's an ability to actively influence the world.<br/>
<br/>
Opera is more like an acquired taste, like coffee or caviar.  You learn to enjoy it by repeated exposure, and while understanding their background is interesting, it doesn't help to enjoy them.  <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, while skills and habits are related, neither one implies the other.  I wouldn't suggest that the concepts are closely connected, even though habitual performance might lead to skill acquisition, and the pleasurable exercise of a skill might lead to habit formation.<br/>
<br/>
By extension, while the use of GM fiat is a skill, I'd say that players develop a taste or a distaste for it, and that GM's develop fiat habits that rarely are related to their skill with fiat.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd ammend my previous post to substitute "taste" for "temperment," which was a vague choice when I made it.                        </div>

<br/>
Excellent point.  I grant that all three are skills.<br/>
<br/>
And my initial reaction is that all of those skills involve absorbing the outside world - perception and processing.<br/>
<br/>
But I'd also grant that formal logic is a skill, and can be practiced, in theory, with no immediate outside input.<br/>
<br/>
But, it seems to me, that appreciating Japanese poetry, seeing the beauty in a musical piece, enjoying the art, or valuing the elegance of a formal proof are not skills, but are instead a matter of taste.<br/>
<br/>
My position remains that skills, habits and tastes are all different things, related primarily by the fact that they can all be learned.  Furthermore and especially that the words "skill," "habit," and "taste" are not particularly synonymous.                        </div>

                            Lemme bring in some teacher-fu, here.  I used to teach reading to middle school (13yo) and high school (16yo) kids.  Reading is definitely a skill, and I think both Judson and Ben will agree there.  However, it's not a simple skill and it's arguably not a single skill.  Recognizing letters, putting them together to make words, and putting the words together to make sentences (and I'm skipping steps in there) is one skill, the very basics of reading.  However, if that is all you can do, you arguably cannot really read.<br/><br/>The next stage of the skill is being able to string those sentences together into rhetorical arguments and stances.  Without being able to do this, the reader cannot understand anything longer than a sentence.  A <em>lot</em> of my kids were at this level.  They simply could not parse a full paragraph, let alone an entire article or story.  This is also a skill -- and it doesn't end there, either.<br/><br/>Once you can comprehend whole blocks of text, you can move on to understanding those stories and books in the context of other stories and books -- and films and music and other things, but most importantly, you can begin to understand them in context of <em>real life</em>.  The ability to draw comparisons between the experiences of a character encoded in text and your experience that morning is also a skill, and requires some very specific and not terribly easy mental processes.  This is also the point at which the reader can actually enjoy what he's reading -- this is when you can sympathize with the character or you can enjoy a specific genre.  Until you have this particular reading skill, in very real ways, you cannot enjoy reading.  I don't doubt that opera is very similar in this regard.<br/><br/>Now, in regards to <em>gaming</em> I think we're seeing some confusion between what we mean by "skills necessary to play" and "skills necessary to enjoy."  In a game of something like Amber, players really need very little to <em>play</em>, given a competent GM.  While other players may do some rather technically complicated things, such skills are not <em>necessary</em> for all players to play.  However, there is a whole nother level of skill required for the player to actually <em>enjoy</em> the experience, and this includes a lot of those 'optional' skills and the very specific mental processes of buying in and investing in the contributions of others.  Again, a good GM can guide a newbie player with the bare minimum of "necessary" skills to develop the "optional" skills in play, and thus a satisfied player is born.  In the mean time, I suspect the novelty of the activity and the raw socialization keeps the new player coming -- not to mention the enjoyment that he sees others are having.                        </div>

You don't need much to start play, but to make it fun for you, fun for others, and something you keep doing you probably need a whole host of skills. <br/><br/>Like those brought up in some other thread, somewhere.                        </div>

                            In regards to JBRs tiered-skills concept, I'd think that the progression for RP goes something along the lines of<br/>
<br/>
Imagining skills<br/>
-- able to imagine the fiction (construct a (non-shared) imagined space)<br/>
-- able to communicate about the fiction<br/>
-- able to modify your personal imagined space in response to input from others<br/>
-- able to successfully change others' perceptions of the fiction<br/>
<br/>
Scope Awareness skills<br/>
-- able to pursue objectives in a single instance of resolution<br/>
-- able to pursue objectives consistently across a scene<br/>
-- able to pursue objectives consistently across larger time/complexity scopes (session, adventure, campaign)<br/>
<br/>
Collaboration Skills<br/>
-- able to recognize and identify opportunities and obstacles within the fiction<br/>
-- able to assess costs/resources based on cues provided<br/>
-- able to apply mechanical resources<br/>
-- able to apply non-mechanical system (Looply Pooply) resources<br/>
-- able to recognize and assess resources possessed by others<br/>
-- able to leverage/solicit application of resources possessed by others to my goals<br/>
-- able to assess and respond to others' solicitation of resources<br/>
-- able to initiate application of my resources to create/forward others' goals without proximate solicitation<br/>
<br/>
There's probably more. This is complex stuff.                        </div>

                            bq. Until you have this particular reading skill, in very real ways, you cannot enjoy reading. I don't doubt that opera is very similar in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
So what you're saying is that you enjoying reading implies you possess the skill of relating the text being read to you own life (or something reasonably similar.)  But is the reverse true?  In other words, if you can relate the book to yourself, will you enjoy reading?                        </div>

                            Judson -- Yeah, I think we're talking past each other.<br/>
<br/>
Let me put it this way: The other night, I played in an Amber game.  One player was an old Amber player, and had clearly developed a skill set around "hah, I hose you!" GMs.  To try to make an effect on the world, he spent *HOURS* asking every conceivable question about tactics and situation.<br/>
<br/>
Another player was new to freeform-y gaming, and he clearly lacked the skills to influence the world.  He ended up imprisoned and powerless.<br/>
<br/>
I, skilled in talking directly to the GM and working out conflicts in freeform, managed to get mostly what I wanted very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting there and listening to the GM -- fine, not a skill.  Actually meaningfully participating the game -- skill.<br/>

                            Ben: sure.  How influential was the skill/style of the GM on the experience of the new player?<br/>
<br/>
Also, was this an adversarial game? (Amber can, of course, go either way and usually sits somewhere in between).<br/>
<br/>
My snap judgement, with far less than useful info, would be that the GM is likely better at skills involving dealing with experienced players (you, and to an extent, the "experienced, but boring" player), but not so good at skills involving retraining play-partners or balancing players with disparate skillsets.  Which wouldn't have mattered if everyone had your skillset rather than their own, but...                        </div>
