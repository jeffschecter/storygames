In the first scene, our characters found a wounded man with mysterious bite marks all over his body. We dialed 911 and were subsequently informed of the zombie outbreak and told to evacuate the state.<br/><br/>We knew that the game was about escaping from the zombie menace, so I was eager to get the scene over with and get to the zombie excitement. The other players were a lot more interested in playing up the initial disbelief and not really wanting to leave. Later, when we were talking about the scene, one of the players said that when the outbreak was announced, the GM should "expect total disbelief."<br/><br/>That got me thinking. When I play in a game, my assumption is that everybody is going to have a basic idea of what the focus of the game is. ("This game is going to be about trying to find a safe space from the zombies.") I expect that I'm going to alter the goals or personality of my character so that they accept the basic premise of the game and engage with it in a meaningful way. I agreed to play in my friend's game, so it's my job to have my character allow me to play.<br/><br/>My character didn't exactly believe that zombies were rising from the grave, but she sure as hell wanted to evacuate, because I knew that the heart of the game was in the evacuation and I wanted to get to the fun.<br/><br/>The other players seemed more interested in playing their characters in a consistent way and having the GM give them a good reason to take action. They expected that the GM would alter the game around them, providing a nice place for their characters to step in and say, "Okay, now we want to do something." The GM agreed to run a game for them, so it's his job to make sure the game goes okay.<br/><br/>Their characters didn't believe in zombies, and they weren't ready to evacuate. They hadn't seen enough danger yet to spur them to action.<br/><br/>So, I've been thinking. Who's responsible for making sure the story happens? In your group, do you like the characters to change for the sake of the game, or the game to change for the sake of the characters?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182518/#Comment_182518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T19:25:46+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  7:25PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: egamad</cite>Who's responsible for making sure the story happens?</blockquote>\nWhoever finishes their drink last, of course!<br/><br/>They also have to drink a penalty shot.  Two if they flinched.<br/><br/><br/>Seriously, though, our games got like a million times better when we stopped assuming that everyone was going to know what the focus of the game was, and started explicitly describing what the focus of the game was before we even picked up pencils and character sheets.  I don't think many (if anyone) in our group gave a rat's ass who made the game's story go, as long as it went smoothly and they didn't get left behind by it.  Knowing up front that, for example, "This game is going to be about a group of friends evacuating the city during a zombie apocalypse" would make it less likely for any of us to get attached to the idea of playing the stubborn skeptic who only wants to stay home and see what CNN has to say about all this nonsense.  It also gives us some wiggle room to do the fun scenes like the one where we try to make it to the local hospital or police station to get help, even though we all know out-of-character how doomed those attempts will be.  Or to put it more generically, establishing the premise of the game explicitly also allows us to establish what genre conventions we want to include or forbid, which in turn can give us a useful kind of story template to key off of.<br/><br/>It's gotten to the point where if whoever wants to run a game <i>doesn't</i> describe the premise explicitly to everyone, they get called on it immediately.  ("That all sounds great, man, but...what's the focus of this game?  I want specifics!")  So I guess in a way we're taking it as a shared responsibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182531/#Comment_182531" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T21:33:11+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:33PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I seek the story, the story is not alive and cannot seek anything, anyone who thinks differently is wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182532/#Comment_182532" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T21:37:07+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds to me like they wanted to play the skeptical characters who tend to get killed off near the beginning of a zombie film.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/egamad" title="egamad"><img alt="egamad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/egamad">egamad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182535/#Comment_182535" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T22:14:17+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 10:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's gotten to the point where if whoever wants to run a game<i>doesn't</i>describe the premise explicitly to everyone, they get called on it immediately.

Here's the thing, I think the other players, playing the disbelief were making sure a story happened. It wasn't the story, at that point, about escaping the zombie outbreak, but it might have eventually become that, or it might be the story about what happens if something really dangerous is happening and nobody acknowledges it and does something about it (hey, it's a metaphor for climate change!), or it might have been something else. Who knows?<br/><br/>So, in answer to that first question, the story happens as a result of the players (that includes the player acting in the role of GM) going in to the game with few expectations about what will happen during play (maybe some loosely held ideas, but that's it), and then seeing what happens as a result of the various personalities at the table as well as the rules being used to organize the fiction.<br/><br/>For the second question. basically, when I play, I never want a player to declare that a character is doing something they wouldn't otherwise do for the sake of the plot.  I'm not sure where that qualifies in your second question, but that's how I feel about it. In fairness, I'm not sure I really understand your second question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
