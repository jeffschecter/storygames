It's ethos of "never make a map so you can add stuff later" stuck, reinforced by Feng Shui and playing games and pre-made scenarios without maps. But when I stumble onto a good map in a scenario, I love it. I don't want a tactical exercise, but I want myself and the players to get a better visual of where they're at. Also, clue-gathering in Cthulhu feels cool if you can point out where you look.<br/><br/>I've made maps every now and then, but I think they suck. Maps in commercial products seem so professional and mine seem out of proportion, the walls look just like a pencil drawing instead of Something Greater, and the houses I make all look alike (that is, like my childhood flat). <br/><br/>Have you had the same problem? How did you get over it? And what do you appreciate in a map, as a player? Is this a silly non-problem which I can pass by just making one map after another?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340494/#Comment_340494" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T14:47:31+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  2:47PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has been one of the problems I've had over the years. I'm also in the Paranoia/Feng Shui camp of not making maps if you don't have to have them. Better to just put a few index cards on the table to represent general locations, distances, and positions if you really need to have one. But then, of course, they aren't very lasting.<br/><br/>When I started a sandbox campaign with Ben Lehman's High Quality RolePlaying Game, I was originally toying around with the idea of taking a bunch of 3x3 inch blank cards (which I can make in obscene quantities at my work, just from scraps), draw little towns, forests, neighborhoods, and larger buildings on each card (in a style a la <a href="http://blog.microdungeons.com/" rel="nofollow">Tony Dowler</a>), and then, as the players adventured and explored the world, I could just stick them down on a large piece of blank paper, give them a name, and voila!<br/><br/>Didn't work out too well, mainly because I kept trying to emulate Tony's style too much (I don't know how he does it, since his stuff is both simple, detailed, and has a way of making them look so curious with a unique sense of perspective), and I got tired of it really quickly.<br/><br/>Now, I'm making city maps that just show streets (sometimes alleyways if necessary), and then leaving everything between blank, so either the players or myself can write in a dot and notes about locations as needed.<br/><br/><a href="http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D With Pornstars</a> also has some good advice on making simple, yet oddly detailed maps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340510/#Comment_340510" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T16:22:54+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  4:22PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely check out <a href="http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=67" rel="nofollow">Vornheim</a>.

All the pro cartographers, mappping software developers, many fantasy authors for the RPG industry are active members. Some use Campaign Cartographer, Photoshop, GIMP, Illustrator, Inkscape, MapTool - I use Xara Xtreme Pro. some create 3D maps, some hand-drawn - there are galleries of finished maps, there are Work-in-Progress maps where members  and pros critique your maps as you post helping you to develop your particular masterpiece.<br/><br/>Many members join as chicken-scratch artists and in 3 months are turning out maps that rival the professionals - really. The tutorials are awesome and the tutorial writers respond to questions asked of the tutorials. I am a senior member there, under the name 'Gamerprinter'.<br/><br/>Check it out, there's no better place to learn about creating maps for game - worlds, regionals, city maps, dungeons, encounter scale maps, VTT maps, etc.<br/> <br/>Here's my latest contest entry - for the August Map Challenge at the Cartographers' Guild (there are already two other entries that meet or exceed mine!):<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.gamer-printshop.com/kaidan/akayama-hi-res-thumb-small.jpg"/><br/><br/>Here's a link to the larger version of this map: <b><a href="http://www.gamer-printshop.com/kaidan/akayama-hi-res.jpg" rel="nofollow">Akayama Tengu Village Map</a></b><br/><br/>Note while I do create completely digital maps as well, my primary style is a hybrid of digital (note the beveled effects, etc.), but it is placed beneath hand-drawn work.<br/><br/>Michael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340513/#Comment_340513" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T16:35:03+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  4:35PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/>Are those hand-drawn elements that are then just duplicated digitally?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MichaelTumey" title="MichaelTumey"><img alt="MichaelTumey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MichaelTumey">MichaelTumey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340514/#Comment_340514" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T16:38:52+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  4:38PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2011 4:48PM by MichaelTumey.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trees, buildings, even the farmed land, but the main mountains are one time only hand-drawings.
