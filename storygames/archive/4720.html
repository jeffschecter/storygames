I wanted to let those who will be creating entries have a say in how their work is evaluated and shared.<br/><br/>First of all, as the contest organizer I will say:<br/>a.) I am 100% fine with doing all the judging myself<br/>b.) I am 100% fine with putting the judging to a small judging panel, which may or may not include me<br/>c.) I am 100% fine with doing peer-based judging<br/><br/>That said, here's what I hold sacred for this contest:<br/>a.) There will be a judging process, and winners declared. I realize some people think that the competition element isn't important, but I think that it is, for this.<br/>b.) I want to award those creating sound, thoughtful designs. There's innovative, cutting-edge, alternative ideas... and then there's ridiculous pipe dreams. I want the contest to reward the former but not the latter.<br/>c.) I would like feedback to be given not just as a general review, and not just as a score. I want it to critically engage weak and strong points in the entry. I don't think this needs to be extensive, but I'd like it to exist. That way, when someone gets their reviews back, they know what their judges thought was unrealistic, overdone, powerful, innovative, etc, etc.<br/><br/><br/>So, that all said... Who has any ideas about how judging should work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106471/#Comment_106471" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T02:59:49+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  2:59AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you should do it.

But if I have some previously established criteria, I find it's easier to put myself in the "disinterested third person" mindset that, while still subjective, focuses my attention at the stuff that I should be judging.  That also helps make my comments on the way out more valuable to the person being evaluated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106702/#Comment_106702" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T08:45:59+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:45AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2007 8:46AM by Jarrod.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Ryan hit the nail on the head here; if he and I are allowed to judge from off the cuff, there'll be some serious mech marketing going on.

This is all good feedback.<br/><br/>Graham, I'm a huge fan of the Shreyas method as you describe it. But I'd also like judge(s) to have guidelines so that they know what they are looking for. Once they've found what they're looking for, the assessment of that thing will be subjective.<br/><br/>If that makes any sense whatsoever.<br/><br/><br/>Basically, here are my thoughts: there are a few categories to assess. Maybe strategy, artifice and innovation are good ones. Let's use those as examples for right now.<br/><br/>Judging an entry means going through the document and noting Critical Strengths and Critical Weaknesses in each category.<br/><br/>There's a big issue there, though.<br/>I feel like that kind of judging would be WAY too elaborate for me to take on alone.<br/>And since there isn't any number assigning in that process, it'd be hard to determine winners without a final arbiter ultimately looking at the Critical Strengths/Weaknesses and the entries anyways.<br/><br/><br/>Hm.
