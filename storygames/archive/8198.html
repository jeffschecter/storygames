The three of us who are playing are all fans of X-Men (the comics and the movies), Harry Potter, and Buffy.  So we decided to combine them. . .sort of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting is our own version of Marvel\u2019s X-Men universe (drawing from the films and the comics), and it is set at Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters.  However, we decided that we wanted to take some of the bits of the Harry Potter and Buffy situation/story and plug our respective X-Men characters into it.  We\u2019re NOT following any proscribed story from the Potter books as some sort of metaplot as we want to leave things open to develop however they may.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that really helped here was that it draws on stuff we all know and love, and we created a relationship map that\u2019s loaded with story possibilities.  Chris Bankuei's article on "The Conflict Web" was used to generate the relationship map.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur characters are:<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel Summers \u201cPhoenix\u201d(taking the Harry Potter/Buffy role\u2014Jean and Scott are dead)--PC<br/>\n<br/>\nKitty Pryde \u201cShadowcat\u201d (taking the Hermione/Willow role)--PC<br/>\n<br/>\nBilly Kaplan \u201cWiccan\u201d (taking the Ron/Xander role)--PC<br/>\n<br/>\nEmma Frost (taking the Severus Snape role)<br/>\n<br/>\nCharles Xavier (taking the Dumbledore/Rupert Giles role)<br/>\n<br/>\nErich Lensherr \u201cMagneto\u201d DECEASED? (taking the Voldemort/Master role)<br/>\n<br/>\nRaven Darkholme \u201cMystique\u201d (taking the Bellatrix LaStrange/Darla role)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe\u2019re using a modified version of Wheel of Fate that I\u2019ve tweaked to be \u201cGMless\u201d (see the link above if you want more info).  We\u2019ve rolled up the characters and we\u2019ll be playing our first session next week!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhaddya Think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180394/#Comment_180394" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T22:35:34+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 10:35PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 10:39PM by Kropotkin.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the relationship map we came up with:<br/><br/><a href="http://s76.photobucket.com/albums/j34/sgzax/?action=view&amp;current=GenXMap.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j34/sgzax/GenXMap.jpg" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>Triangles are hate/dislike, squares represent indifference, rectangles are ambivalance, circles are affection/love etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
