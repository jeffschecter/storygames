Each disease starts in a separate location.  All diseases at Rank 2.  Player characters are a party that goes on missions to eradicate diseases.  Each mission counts as one "turn".  Each turn, all diseases advance by 1 rank.<br/><br/>If characters fail in a mission, and the disease they were fighting goes up to Rank 4 or higher, they become carriers for that disease, spreading it wherever they go until a true antidote can be found.<br/><br/>If the characters infect 2 sites, their boss will realize they're carriers, terminate their operation, and quarantine them, thus ending the game in failure (option to become hunted refugees instead while still pursuing cures sans resources?).  The GM will then play out the apocalypse depending on the state of things when the characters were removed from play.<br/><br/>During each mission, the players must deploy their characters' talents and resources to get bonuses to the mission's die roll.  Each disease is different; the GM chooses from a dozen templates, each one with its own strengths, weaknesses, telltales, and color.  When the players have done all they can, the die is rolled.  <br/>Results range: <br/>1) Cure Found, Eradication Imminent - this disease is vanquished, though possibly with a delay pending endgame conditions<br/>2) Treatments &amp; Containment Instated - this disease is reduced to Rank 1; each turn, it can be kept at Rank 1 by sacrificing small resources (i.e., choose slight penalty on other missions), otherwise it resumes normal progression<br/>3) Buying Time - this disease does not progress in rank during this turn or the next<br/>4) Failure - you accomplish nothing; this disease marches on<br/><br/>Roleplaying through a specific mission involves mostly investigation, looking at stuff, talking to people, and gathering info so as to best strategize use of resources.  Tests are made along the way, with success granting bonus to final mission die roll and failure granting penalties.  Tests are mostly based on character skills, with resources as modifiers.  All skills are character-specific (no overlap), and all measured resources are finite.  <br/><br/>All this can be high-color as the GM riffs off the disease template and injects the fiction with sympathetic, stricken NPCs; or low-color, as the players quickly assemble facts and make decisions.  <br/><br/>That's my brainstorm.  Honestly, this is a bit boardgamey for my own RPG tastes... I'd probably use it as a framework, and inject mission scenes with a lot of character-specific and overarching-plot stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203921/#Comment_203921" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T15:26:30+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  3:26PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Phases 1-4 could be plenty fun, as long as you ensure you are playing the right characters- Epidimiologists, Farmers, Vets, Politicians and Civil Servants could all be nice - and doing productive stuff: making connections, building platform, establishing details, making you care about what's in place, and forming some futile/unlikely routes to combat the threat.<br/><br/>If you start from 1 and play upwards then you actually give a damn when things kick off. <i>People starving in the suburbs?

Suggests too much of being able to jump around.  Zombie Cinema would be a neat hack, but to come up with something more base (or maybe Serial Homicide Unit, drifted for CDC rather than homicide detectives)...<br/><br/>A game about people reacting to the different phases comes to mind.  In fact, I would look at stealing from Pandemic (the board game) and make this about people who over time are dealing with how the pandemic intersects with their lives.  The early scenes are more about them to establish a baseline, and the mechanic (from the board game) involves a deck of cards, specifically:<br/><br/>* A deck of forty A-10 cards split into five after shuffling, so eight cards in each pile.<br/>* In each sub-deck, put a face card in, and shuffle that.<br/>* Put all the decks together, so that somewhere within each layer of nine is a face card, but you don't know where.<br/><br/>Then as you play, people draw a card to resolve, uh, something. I don't care about that right now. The number or suit or bother determines crap -- still don't care.  When the face card is drawn, the scene is interrupted with how the escalation happens.  You start at phase 1, then with the first card you're at phase 2, and so on.  With each phase, the chance that the illness interferes with your life is greater -- perhaps the number on the card determines that, and the suit merely determines who gets whatever in the conflict that I still don't care about.<br/><br/>In any case, that's how I would envision it, mainly because Graham titled the thread as so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204027/#Comment_204027" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T22:28:18+00:00" title="April 28, 2009 10:28PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played the Pandemic board game (nominated for an Origins this year).

I like all that.<br/><br/>There are two things that excite me about this. Firstly, the idea of starting small, with nice everyday scenes, and building up to Epic Catastrophe. Secondly, the idea of <i>infecting</i> a relationship map. I love that. In the first few scenes, you establish a relationship map and flesh out the relationships. Then someone gets infected and the infection spreads, slowly, over the map. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
