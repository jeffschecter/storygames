It's 2+ players, a straight-up combat game of fightin' dragons. To be a playtester, you need to have:<br/><br/>-A willingness to read about ten pages of densely-written (but not terribly complex) rules.<br/>-The capacity to print two pages out of a PDF.<br/>-A big pile of six-sided dice - like, seven or eight at a minimum.<br/>-Pencils, and possibly a stack of tokens if you'd like to re-use sheets.<br/>-At least one other person you can sit down with for an hour or two to play.<br/>-The desire to give feedback.<br/>-The understanding that you will be playing a draft rule-set. There WILL be screwy things.<br/><br/>If this interests you, or have questions you can email me (Levi.Kornelsen@gmail.com), or just say something here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229680/#Comment_229680" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T13:50:20+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:50PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And, drafts have been sent out. <br/><br/>If you wanted to get in, but didn't get one, let me know.
