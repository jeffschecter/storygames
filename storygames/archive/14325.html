They were fantasy stories where the emotions and passions mattered, where both male and female characters were important, where magic was both powerful and dangerous, where sex was treated both maturely and as something fun, where major characters died for real, where choices had consequences.<br/><br/>I originally read the comics in color, but I really dislike a lot of the newer editions of recent years with poor re-colorings or reassembling the panels to fit in manga-sized volumes or sticking later (and poorer) stories on the front or inserting them into the middle. Bleh!  I've yet to find a recent printing that I like.<br/><br/>I remember the Chaosium RPG too, which was actually pretty fun to play.  I mean, thinking about it now, it didn't really support much of what the comics were really about, but it was pretty decent for its time.  There was this thing, though, where it kinda incentivized you to play elves of all different types (wolfriders, gliders, sunfolk, dolphinriders, etc.) or maybe both elves and trolls (even though they never hang out together in the comics) just because of the traditional RPG idea that you don't want to all be of the same "class."  Our groups of characters would have made really poor comics and they didn't really make much sense in a game either.<br/><br/>Anybody else have memories of the comics or the game to share?  Surely they were important to a lot of people.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325428/#Comment_325428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T00:38:53+00:00" title="May 20, 2011 12:38AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started reading Elfquest in about 1983 at the Perth Comics Shop (it was the only one). It was issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, the original WaRP Graphics B&amp;W issue. Being a 70s kid, I dug the art style, the costumes and pagan-hippie vibe, and I bought it and issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. From then on I bought them as they came out, getting Ralph (the comic shop guy) to order <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and the reprint of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> (the original <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> was in a different format and unavailable).<br/><br/>I thought the Pinis put a lot of heart into their creation. I liked that they were this kooky husband-and-wife team that did this thing. I kept on expecting them to choke, but they kept it up all the way to issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2320&amp;Mode=like">#20</a>. After that nothing came out for a while, and by the time it did I had stopped buying comics regularly. I've still got my original set of 20, a perfect jewel of a fantasy story in graphic form.<br/><br/>I never had a burning desire to play Elfquest, and the game seemed to be a set of hacks for RQ, which was my main system, so I didn't bother to get it.

I read about the first trade paperback's worth in Finnish translations (European album format), then the rest of the quest storyline (what, eight albums) in English, all in color; later material always seemed spotty and uneven in quality, and I wasn't much for obsessiveness with comics, so I was satisfied with appreciating the original story for what it was. The roleplaying game, when I encountered it in high school, felt typical of the time when I was generally dissatisfied by what roleplaying games strived for and accomplished; it was a cheap and thoughtless run-of-the-mill adaptation of BRP, obviously typed up by some geek hack. I particularly remember thinking how it was remarkable that the game managed to make the world of the comics seem utterly boring. Didn't even consider playing it.<br/><br/>The Pinis put up a complete collection of Elfquest comics <a href="http://www.elfquest.com/gallery/OnlineComics3.html" rel="nofollow">in the Internet</a> a few years back.

(It wasn't even all online by that time. That got completed a little later.) And then I finally got to read it from the very beginning.

Reading it now (as I seem to do every five years), it still holds up extremely well as a classic work of American indie comics. Elfquest remains on my short list of works I recommend blindly to anybody unaware of it, for it doesn't really have any peers as a combination of disciplined traditional fantasy and west coast hippy zeitgeist, especially when you take the production values into account. Completely magical as a first encounter, and I have in fact been planning for a bit to start trolling my 10-year old nephew with it one of these days.<br/><br/>So there, that's off my chest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325476/#Comment_325476" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-20T09:19:38+00:00" title="May 20, 2011  9:19AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this reminiscing really makes me wish for a new ElfQuest RPG, written along the lines of recent indie game design work.

The original arc (especially with the colors from the 4 Starblaze books) is simply a pinnacle of story in any medium.  It's fun, exuberant, touching, shocking, traumatic, beautiful and unique.  It's not just a coming of age story, loss of innocence, buddy road trip, slapstick comedy, war epic, adventure, world exploration, identity politics morality play -- it's the best parts of all of those, melded together seamlessly, with wolves and magic, and humans as badguys.  <br/><br/>I cannot possibly imagining any gaming doing it justice.  That said:<br/>a) It would be fun to hang out in the wolfriders' world a bit.  <br/>b) I could see telling a tale of a different world that explores similar themes.  We already know what truths Cutter finds out there, but I'd be down to take his questions and port them over to somewhere they're not yet answered.  Who's my family, where are they all now, where did we come from, and how much is it worth to find out?<br/><br/>P.S. I'm from Ithaca too, and often glimpsed the Pinis at the comic conventions at the downtown Masonic temple.
