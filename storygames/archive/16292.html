I told him that I knew there were several retailers in England that carry our games (notably <a href="http://www.leisuregames.com/" rel="nofollow">Leisure Games</a> in London and <a href="http://www.patriotgames.ltd.uk/store/" rel="nofollow">Patriot Games</a> in Sheffield) and lots of gamers and mini-cons (I mentioned that <a href="http://www.geas.org.uk/conpulsion/" rel="nofollow">Conpulsion</a> was happening right at that moment in Edinburgh). <br/><br/>Finally, I told him to come here to find out more. So assuming he does, where can someone in the UK go to find and play story games, and to meet other like-minded gamers? What are the conventions and meetups that they should know about?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371952/#Comment_371952" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T13:05:38+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  1:05PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 1:16PM by Matt.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The short version:<br/><br/><b>Indie Friendly Conventions<br/></b><br/><a href="http://www.dragonmeet.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Dragonmeet</a> in London in December-ish <br/><a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow</a> in Milton Keynes, twice yearly in March and September<br/>Conpulsion as mentioned above<br/><a href="http://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">UK Games Expo</a> in Birmingham in June (at least one indie stand plus games to be played)<br/><a href="http://www.indiecon.net/" rel="nofollow">Indiecon</a> in November in Dorset <br/><a href="http://rpgfurnace.com/" rel="nofollow">Furnace</a> in Sheffield in October <br/><br/><b>Meetups<br/></b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.facebook.com/GlasgowIndieGamers" rel="nofollow">Glasgow Indie Gamers</a><br/><a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-RPG-Meetup-Group/" rel="nofollow">London Indie RPG Meetup</a> <br/><br/>Plus others I'm probably forgetting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn" title="Murgh_Bpurn"><img alt="Murgh_Bpurn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn">Murgh_Bpurn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371989/#Comment_371989" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:20:27+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:20PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running indie games at UK Games Expo.

I feel like we get a weird half-picture in the states from the few people we see in Yankistan on a semi-regular basis (Graham, Gregor, etc). Are the Collective Endeavour and Contested Ground still active? Has the center of UK indie stuff moved to London and the Midlands? Is it mostly a bunch of random folks spread out all over the place or are there local pockets like in the states (NYC, Western Mass, NoCal, PacNW, Central NC, Midwest)? Where are these new folks like James Mullen coming from and how are they getting plugged into indie games?  Is it internet first or local meet-ups first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372036/#Comment_372036" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T19:38:02+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  7:38PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2012 7:40PM by Graham.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, it's hard to summarise, but here's an attempt. There are various active RPG clubs: the Pompey Crew in Plymouth, the Milton Keynes RPG Club, the London Indie RPG meetup. There are also various indie-friendly RPG conventions: IndieCon, Concrete Cow, Conception, Furnace. And there's crossover between the two, so that the Pompey Crew does lots of stuff at IndieCon and Conception, while Milton Keynes RPG Club organises Concrete Cow.<br/><br/>I think the new design stuff comes from those clubs and conventions. James Mullen is a Milton Keynes RPG Club stalwart. The excellent game <i>Witch</i> comes from the Pompey Crew. Stuart Chaplin attends the London Indie RPG Meetup. Sebastian Hickey goes to various conventions, including London Indie RPG Meetup. <br/><br/>So I think the clubs and conventions are the things to watch. That's where new games are played and discussed and where some new designs get tested.<br/><br/>(I'm in the South, so I'm probably missing the stuff that happens in the North and in Scotland.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372054/#Comment_372054" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T01:21:50+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  1:21AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another good place for him to check out is www.ukroleplayers.com - and, in fact, it gives a pretty strong indication of what's going on around the place. There are plenty of regional clubs with their own forums on there (our own, STURP, has arguably a bigger web presence than we have IRL, and we're moving more and more storygamy as the weeks pass). Having just got back from Conpulsion, there was a decent amount of Indie games being run there (Mouse Guard, Chronicles of Skin, Monsterhearts, Monkey, Hot War, Dead of Night, .... and probably more that I've missed...) Furnace has a similar strong Indie representation, and I get the feeling there's lots of us about in the UK talking about them here and on ukroleplayers.<br/><br/>For what it's worth (and all I know of the US scene is what's gleaned from this site), UK-based Indie games get more exposure over here than in the States (Monkey, Duty &amp; Honour/Beat to Quarters, Hot War, Wordplay, others I've no doubt missed)... which I guess is to be expected.<br/><br/>Guy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372062/#Comment_372062" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T02:39:20+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  2:39AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there's definitely pockets and it's Con or Meetup based.
