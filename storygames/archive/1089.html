                            I would also note that the article indicates that they thought very carefully about their target audience and designed to them, also.                        </div>

                            Huh. No other comments on this article at all, or did it just get lost in all of the convention discussion?                        </div>

                            I'll bite. <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/><br/><br/>Lately I've been following news on both video games and RPGs very closely. For that matter I have a friend who works in the industry, and another who left it out of disgust. And, yeah, parallels abound.<br/><br/>The video game industry was really getting way too much into trying to hold onto chunks of the hardcore market, with games getting budgets comparable to Hollywood blockbusters (and in many cases cinematography to match), and a lot of the recent stuff that's come out and has been announced has been a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Most video gamers balked when they saw images of Nintendo's Wii controller, but for someone who isn't used to playing video games a controller that doesn't have ten buttons and three directional controls has a lot of appeal. I am reminded more than a little of the talk about gateway games that's been going on. I think Shigeru Miyamoto is on the right track; he's the one who said he wants to make games that anyone can play. A game like PTA that uses a deck of cards and is about making up a TV show is no doubt a hell of a lot more accessible than a game about quasi-Tolkien fantasy that requires six kinds of polyhedral dice and thee hardcover rulebooks of about 300 pages each.<br/><br/>Xbox Live Arcade has brought some really nifty stuff to home consoles that wouldn't have been practical before, and on the PC... heck, my grandma plays Scrabble on her computer. I keep meaning to show her Brain Age on my Nintendo DS too.<br/><br/>And Spore; thought it's backed by EA and all that, the procedural stuff has immense potential because, goddamnit, they're trying to use software to be efficient and solve problems and create algorithms even for things that would traditionally be hard-coded, and as a result you've got a game where you can design a creature with anywhere from one leg to dozens, and the game just figures out how to animate it walking, instead of a 3D artist putting together each frame for each and every animation. This kind of procedural programming hasn't exactly swept the industry by storm, and it does have certain drawbacks (procedurally rendered textures take up much less disk space, but use more processing power, for example), but the potential there is exciting.<br/><br/>Do you think RPGs share video games' tendency for a genre that becomes successful to "petrify" over time? First person shooters hit it big with Doom, and today there's dozens released every year to an ever-shrinking fanbase, which has ever more stringent demands about what constitutes a "real" FPS. I'm a big fan of Halo, and when PC gamers complain about the game, entirely too many of their objections seem to stem from the game not being sufficiently similar to Counterstrike. Similarly, Gran Turismo, a game by and for people who are car fanatics, is regarded as the pinnacle of the racing genre, and racing games that aren't as obsessive about simulation get dismissed as being too "arcadey" or even "kiddy," with little regard for, you know, how fun they are.<br/><br/>Of course, video games don't have anything like D&amp;D, though that's not for lack of trying on World of Warcraft's part. Two of my friends are infected now, but thankfully my tabletop gaming hasn't suffered.                        </div>

                            In video games, the problem is publishers and retail channels above all, as the article correctly identifies. It's a mistake to believe that too strongly in paper games. The good retailers are extremely eager to show off new styles in roleplaying, as the old stuff isn't moving the way it used to. The bad retailers are a lot more plentiful, but they're tending towards going away, for other reasons. And the barriers to publishing are essentially gone in paper games. (Promotion is another story, but our barrier is still a lot lower.)                        </div>
