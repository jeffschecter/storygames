                            Our DM presented us with one during our high-school AD&amp;D2 campaign. Predictably, one of the players just HAD to press his luck and keep drawing until one of the bad things happened to him. We just used a deck comprised of standard poker cards. I was always excited by the prospect of building one out of Tarot cards, since at that age such a thing was still slightly taboo.<br/><br/>It's Open Gaming Content now, so it occurred to me that it would be even cooler if you could actually have the cards as described, with original art and such.<br/><br/>In case anyone's unfamiliar with the cards, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/artifacts.htm#deckofManyThings" rel="nofollow">here's the list</a>.<br/><br/>There's another item in D&amp;D like this, the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#deckofIllusions" rel="nofollow">Deck of Illusions</a>, but it's not quite as cool.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, WotC bundled a set of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/dx20020801x" rel="nofollow">Olidammara's Dice</a> with pre-orders of the Epic Level Handbook. As far as I can tell, these were just normal pipped d6's with a custom symbol printed on the "One" face.<br/><br/>I've maintained that AD&amp;D1 is really just a collection of minigames. (Combat game. Thieving game. Lordship game. Pseudo-medieval simulator.) These items are some of the more imaginative examples. Games within the game, so to speak.<br/><br/><br/>Mostly though, I just wanted to vent about my own dumb lack of proactiveness on the matter.<br/><br/>If somebody wants to threadjack this into the state of indie custom card printing, that would also be cool. Doubt on whether this was financially do-able for me was a real initiative killer.<br/><br/><br/>JD, what's Wonderfalls?                        </div>

                            The Wand of Wonder is a similar artefact in its effect. One of our players back in the day always wanted a Wand of Wonder, and the GM reluctantly let him - reluctantly, I think, because the random element might interfere with his railroading, but maybe he just thought it was lame to have a magic item that could produce problems as easily as solutions.<br/><br/>That rhinoceros it conjured during a fight actually came in pretty handy, in the event.                        </div>

                            Yeah, but the Wand of Wonder is just a table roll. There's no prop you can make to generate the random effect <i>instead of</i> making a table roll. I think that's what I like best about the aforementioned items: you, the player, actually handle a prop similar to the magic item in the game, and that prop has a functional randomizing effect. They were designed to be real-world items from the ground up.<br/><br/>If this is just going to devolve into geeking out about D&amp;D trivia, I'll mention there was an item called "Wand of A Wonder" in <i>Temple of Elemental Evil</i>, which had a 1% chance of firing a death ray, with the rest of the table being bad or annoyingly useless effects. Presumably, the fun was getting the players' hopes up for having found a Wand of Wonder, then savoring the <i>schadenfreude</i> of ensuing use.                        </div>
