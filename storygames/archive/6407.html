Tell me if I did it right, as well as how it's presented.<br/><br/>Last night Greg and I played unWritten in a setting that Greg is developing for a comic book he\u2019s working on\u2026 <br/>We started the game by talking about what we wanted to play. I said I wanted to play something inspired by Mouse Guard, a great graphic novel found <a href="http://www.davidpetersen.net/mouseguard/index.htm" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>. Greg mentions his comic that was inspired by Mouse Guard, best described as, \u201cThe Secret of NIMH meets I Am Legend.\u201d That sounded perfect. We decided on two pre-game rules: 1) There is nothing mystical, though forms of technology can be \u201cinterpreted\u201d by the rats as being magic. 2) There is no rat to human translations. The time frame of the game is such that the rats are cognitively equal to humans, but, they haven\u2019t yet develop literacy or any means of reading human text. So, this is the background we are started from\u2026<br/><br/>Humans genetically modified rats to the point that the rats could have human-like cognitive capabilities. A \u201cby-product\u201d of this was their increased size to about 2\xbd or 3 feet tall, when standing on their hind legs, and an increased life-span, about 50 years. The humans have mysteriously disappeared, leaving the world, as we know it today, to the rats. Except, the rats don\u2019t know who the humans were, or what happened to them. The main preoccupation of the rats is finding sustenance and resources and maintaining their shelters safe. The rats have not yet developed any form of agriculture or manufacturing at this time. They purely live by scavenging the remains of the humans. And, finally, our protagonists will be the second generation of these rats that have lived since the humans have died.<br/><br/>Here are the three opening cues we came up with from the previous conversation:\n<ul>\n<li>Intelligent Rats in a (ours) post-human world.<br/>Tribes at war over sustenance &amp; resources.<br/>Did the gods gift this to us or abandon us?<br/></li>\n</ul>\nThese are the two protagonists we created:<br/>Greg\u2019s protagonist\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Wind<br/>Role: Guardian of High Places<br/>Physical Trait: Agile<br/>Drive: Aspiration; Protect the Others<br/>Drive: Inclination; Run After Mysteries<br/></li>\n</ul>\nMy protagonist\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Watcher<br/>Role: Seeker of New Skies (scout)<br/>Mental Trait: Custodian of Earth and Air (shaman skills)<br/>Drive: Aspiration; To Find the Answers of our Past<br/>Drive: Inclination; Being Abandoned, retreat to the depths<br/></li>\n</ul>\nBefore we actually began, we agreed that our tribes rats lived in a sky scraper in downtown Los Angeles. Their tribe is called the \u201cStorm Seekers.\u201d And, that we would be using the cinematic rules (once known as quickplay rules).<br/><br/>The setting was really Greg\u2019s baby, so I suggested that he start the game by framing the first scene. His first scene was a parallel scene (these scenes allow multiple protagonists to work towards a single goal). From there we went to primary scene development until the last scene we played, which was my protagonist\u2019s scene, then we did a parallel scene. We didn\u2019t finish the game, though, we\u2019ll be doing that tonight. Hear is a scene by scene breakdown of how the game went.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141738/#Comment_141738" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:14:32+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:14AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 1: In the first scene Greg asks \u201cWho or what do I care about or value?\u201d and he features the cue \u201c Tribes at war over sustenance &amp; resources.\u201d He places Wind at the top of an old building in downtown LA keeping watch. Meanwhile, Watcher is chasing after a moth across some now defunct power line. The Bloody Fangs attack our tribe of rats, Wind leads the defenses and Watcher leads the escape. In the end, the defense fail and our tribe gets decimated (Wind failed his conflict). But, do to Winds valiant efforts, Watcher is able to help a dozen or so tribes men and women escape. Though the Bloody Fangs did light the building on fire in an attempt to stop the survivors from escaping.\n<ul>\n<li>From this scene Wind earned the boon \u201cValiant Defender\u201d and the blight \u201cI failed my tribe.\u201d However, because Watcher won his conflict he gets a new trait, a new cue. The new trait is a social trait \u201cDe-facto leader\u201d and the new cue is \u201cStorm Seeker Survivors.\u201d Watcher also earns the boon \u201cI can find a way out\u201d and the blight \u201cI\u2019m not cut out for this.\u201d Additionally, the cue \u201cTribes at war over sustenance &amp; resources\u201d was blighted with \u201cThe Storm Seekers were scattered.\u201d<br/></li>\n</ul>\nScene 2: The next scene is a primary scene, so it just focuses on my character Watcher. I focused the scene on the question \u201cWhat internal struggle must you come to terms with?\u201d and the cue \u201cStorm Seeker Survivors.\u201d This scene consisted of Watcher leading the survivors away from the Bloody Fangs as they chased us, the last remaining survivors. In the end, we escaped into the sewers, towards a possible new sanctuary. (Watcher failed his conflict, the conflict in this case was whether he would lead the survivors or not. You see, he was struggling with his new role as the \u201cDe-facto leader\u201d).\n<ul>\n<li>From this scene Watcher earned the a new trait \u201cI know this land\u201d a new cue was created \u201cPredators\u201d (the survivors mentioned how they were scared to go into the sewers because of the predators) and De-facto Leader was further blighted, as was \u201cTribes at war over sustenance &amp; resources.\u201d<br/></li>\n</ul>\nScene 3: Greg attempted to answer the question \u201cWho or what do you care about or value?\u201d and used the cue \u201cIntelligent rats in our post-human world.\u201d This scene consisted of Wind waking up after the battle and being left for dead by the survivors and the Bloody Fangs. Wind, waking do to the fire lit by the The Bloody Fangs is forced to escape the building by scaling the outside. But, in the end he is forced to climb ever higher where the rain and wind keeps the building cold and wet. (He failed the conflict.)\n<ul>\n<li>From this scene Wind earned the mental trait \u201cUrban Survival\u201d and created the new cue \u201cIt\u2019s winter and it\u2019s raining.\u201d He also earned the blight \u201cfatigued\u201d and blighted the cue \u201cIntelligent rats in our post-human world\u201d with the \u201cThe ruins are dangerous.<br/></li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141739/#Comment_141739" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:14:50+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:14AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2008 11:15AM by alejandro.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene 4: In this scene I asked the question \u201cHow are you incapable of dealing with this issue?\u201d and I invoked the cue \u201cPredators.\u201d As we crawled through the sewers to a location that Watcher believed would be a suitable new home, we were attacked by a mutant snake-fish. Watcher partially succeeded at fending off the snake fish. In the end, he was split off from the rest of the survivors he agreed to lead. (Watcher partially succeeded at his conflict.)\n<ul>\n<li>From this scene Watcher earned the physical trait \u201cEnduring\u201d a new cue was created \u201cSewer sanctuary\u201d (though we screwed up, this should have been a rewritten cue, not a new one. Well fix it tonight when we play again). I was blighted with \u201cI\u2019m tired and distracted.\u201d the cue \u201cStorm Seeker Survivors\u201d was booned with \u201cThe strongest survived\u201d and the the cue \u201cPredators\u201d was blighted with the \u201cwe enter their den.\u201d<br/></li>\n</ul>\nScene 5: In this scene Greg asks \u201cWhat internal struggle must you come to terms with?\u201d and featured the cue \u201cStorm Seeker Survivors.\u201d Wind follows the Bloody Fangs through the streets and sees a scouting party, 5 of them, sent into the sewers to follow the survivors. Wind, enters the sewers from a different area and, with bow and arrow in hand, begins to take out the scouts one at a time. He kills 3 of them when they figure out they attack him, and the snake-fish attacks all three of them\u2026 In the end, Wind gets the snake-fish to attack the remaining scouts and he escapes further down the sewers.\n<ul>\n<li>From this scene Wind earned the physical trait \u201cCrack Shot\u201d and created the new cue \u201cBloody Fangs war party.\u201d He also earned the blight \u201cI need the stars to navigate\u201d and booned the cue \u201cPredator\u201d with \u201cIt\u2019s already eaten.\u201d<br/></li>\n</ul>\nScene 6: This scene was mine to frame. It chose to make it a parallel scene, such that both protagonists are featured in the scene. In this scene I chose to ask the question \u201cWhat have you gained by addressing this issue?\u201d and the featured cue was \u201cPredator.\u201d In this scene, Watcher was making his way back to survivors and as Wind was finding his way to the survivors. The snake-fish attacks Wind, Watcher jumps on its back and stabs it in the \u201cneck\u201d (He succeeds at the conflict). Watcher gives Wind an opening, as the snake-fish reals its head, to shoot it in the neck and head several times. In the end, Wind slays the snake-fish and Watcher and Wind are reunited.\n<ul>\n<li>From this scene Watcher earned the physical trait (ah, I didn\u2019t actually get it\u2026).  He earned the Blight \u201cAt my limit\u201d and strengthened the boon \u201cThe strongest survive\u201d from the cue \u201cStorm Seekers Survive.\u201d<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Meanwhile, Wind earned the (ah, didn\u2019t give him a new trait either\u2026) he got the boon \u201cValiant defender\u201d strengthened and the boon \u201cIt\u2019s already eaten.\u201d<br/>This is what the cues and protagonist\u2019s looked like when we were done with the game.<br/></li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141740/#Comment_141740" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-30T11:15:11+00:00" title="April 30, 2008 11:15AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2008 11:15AM by alejandro.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cues\n<ul>\n<li>Intelligent Rats in a (ours) post-human world. -1; Blight: The ruins are dangerous<br/>Tribes at war over sustenance &amp; resources. -2; Blight: The Storm Seekers were scattered.<br/>Did the gods gift this to us or abandon us?<br/>Storm Seeker survivors. +2; Boon: The strongest survived<br/>Predators. 0; Boon: It\u2019s already eaten; Blight: We enter their den<br/>It\u2019s winter and it\u2019s raining<br/>Sewer sanctuary. -1; Blight:Some of us made it.<br/>Bloody Fang War Party.<br/></li>\n</ul>\nThese are what the protagonists became:<br/>Greg\u2019s protagonist\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Wind<br/>Role: Guardian of High Places. -1; Blight: I failed my tribe<br/>Mental Trait: Urban Survival; Blight: I need the stars to navigate.<br/>Physical Trait: Agile +1; Boon: Valiant Defender; Blight: Fatigued.<br/>Physical Trait: Crack Shot<br/>Drive: Aspiration; Protect the Others<br/>Drive: Inclination; Run After Mysteries<br/></li>\n</ul>\nMy protagonist\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Watcher<br/>Role: Seeker of New Skies (scout). +1: Boon: I can find a way<br/>Social Trait: De-facto Leader. -2; Blight: I\u2019m not cut out for this.<br/>Mental Trait: Custodian of Earth and Air (shaman skills). -1; Blight: I\u2019m tired &amp; distracted<br/>Mental Trait: I know this land<br/>Physical Trait: Enduring. -1; Blight: At my limit.<br/>Drive: Aspiration; To Find the Answers of our Past<br/>Drive: Inclination; Being Abandoned, retreat to the depths<br/></li>\n</ul>\nSo, that was the first part of the game.
