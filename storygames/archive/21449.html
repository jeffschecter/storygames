(Or rather, that's the lowest layer on the dungeon). My idea is that there are perhaps 6 - 10 separate high security vaults, each of which is protected by defences both physical, magical and monstrous. Without the right key, you're going to have to pick locks, burn through metal, dispel wards, and fight monstrous guardians. One or two keys may be lost forever. But the rest will be scattered throughout the rest of the sandbox world. Hopefully, the players will keep returning here, keep wondering what's behind the remaining doors, and be eagerly seeking out rumours and clues to the location of the remaining keys.<br/><br/>So with all that hype, I want the treasures to be really great - each one exciting in its own right. And I want them to be varied - not all coming from my single authorial voice. So: please tell me your treasure ideas!<br/><br/>They can cover quite a broad range of "value", as there will be different levels of security on the vaults. There may also be some low and medium security treasures - safety deposit boxes and treasure chests and the like, so if you have cool ideas for those, feel free to throw those into the pot too!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469361/#Comment_469361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T19:14:24+00:00" title="January 27, 2018  7:14PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, obviously you're going to have to have the <i>Deck of Many Things</i> in there.<br/><br/>Other notions, let's see how many I can type up in 10 minutes:<br/><b>*</b> Design plans and notes for frightfully advanced weaponry, with one or two working samples, plus a keg of gunpowder.

Literal skeletons, of course - they murdered the royal family and paid the dwarves to hide the bodies. There's even a receipt. Dwarves are stone cold.<br/><b>*</b> Dwarf Eggs<br/><b>*</b> A trapped angel<br/><b>*</b> The manual to an otherwise lost prestige class<br/><b>*</b> A magical hand-mirror that can be manipulated to transmit light and sound between the mirror and any flawless precious gems (not otherwise magically charged) within a mile or so.

When all 1,000 spaces are filled with lit, pure beeswax candles, the light that the chandelier casts reveals hidden weapons, outlines magical items with an aura revealing their school and strength, and reveals all invisible things as per <i>true sight</i>. In the past, important diplomatic banquets and negotiations were held by its light.<br/><br/>* A severed arm, unnaturally pale and branded with sigils. When the stump is placed against skin, the arm bonds there and from then on can be controlled mentally. This mental control takes the form of commands like "defend me", "grab that", not proprioception and direct control, so it's hard to do things which require co-ordination like tie knots or juggle. The arm cannot be removed except with surgery. The arm has its own secret agenda, and if the host goes against it, the arm threatens the host, or attempts to kill them if they persist. The arm's agenda is (d6): 1. The preservation of all Dwarven lives 2. (rest of table to come later)<br/><br/>* A magic carpet that only flies at enormous speed, and offers no protection against falling off.<br/><br/>* A jeep with several drums of fuel in the back and the keys in the ignition (at the bottom of a dungeon with lots of staircases...)<br/><br/>I would be delighted to make this available to others to use if there's interest (and I'll of course credit contributors). Thanks for the reminder about <i>The God that Crawls</i> <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>, I had forgotten that had interesting treasure in it.

Your module wouldn't need to specify where all the keys are in the world, either; just spec the location itself with its dangers and treasures, and it'd be a fit addition to rather many campaign worlds. Just lots of different keys, a whole system of them (maybe color-coded or something), so there's a lot of stuff to scatter around. And regenerating dangers so the place can still surprise on the second visit [grin].<br/><br/>Just remember to put some cleared vaults in there as well, if the concept is that people sometimes find these keys and use them successfully. The premise needs a good balance of lore (not everybody can know about the place, or the keys would not be discoveries) and keys and time (too much of it, and every key's already been found and used).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469426/#Comment_469426" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-29T20:55:59+00:00" title="January 29, 2018  8:55PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A 10'x10'x10' room tightly packed full of unfamiliar bones.
