It's made it difficult for me in some ways, forex I've had to learn not just the 'language' of roleplaying, i.e. expressions like task resolution, skill checks, OOC, initiative order, fluff, flavour and crunch etc., but also the tropes that people who have been roleplaying since they were at school take for granted, and which also form part of the roleplayer's argot, such as bags of holding and so forth. I've absorbed a huge amount over the last three years, but even now I find it hard to join in some conversations because I don't get the references to the various games being talked about. <br/><br/>On the plus side, having come to RPGs at the tail end of the indie explosion, and having thus been exposed immediately to the kinds of narrative, GMless and high bleed games that get talked about here (my first ever RPG was a game of Dogs in the Vineyard, facilitated by Indie Pete, as he was then known, at Indiecon in November 2010), I don't ever have to play any combat-heavy rules monsters if I don't want to. And another curious thing: I'm very interested in the theory and practice of game design, and so I've also absorbed a bit more rapidly the lingo of the more modern games, and the way they're talked about, which means that occasionally when I'm in a conversation with seasoned veterans, <i>they </i>don't get <i>my </i>references. It's a bit bizarre. In the last few weeks, during the pre-game chat at a home group Space 1889 game I've been in since early this year, I've floored the GM, who's more or less stuck to TSR-type games since he was at school, with terms such as granularity and ashcan. A couple of weeks ago he even asked me what BRP meant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417440/#Comment_417440" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T10:26:48+00:00" title="June 28, 2013 10:26AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2013 10:27AM by Zelbinian.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've absorbed a huge amount over the last three years, but even now I find it hard to join in some conversations because I don't get the references to the various games being talked about. </blockquote>\nThis resonates with me. Technically my first exposure to roleplaying games was in childhood - I'd played exactly one thrown-together session of AD&amp;D 2.5 (I think) when I was about 12 or 13 on a boy scout camping trip. But I don't really count that, because after that either I couldn't find friends that wanted to play or, slightly more common, my friends that were already playing didn't think I was cool enough to join in their campaigns. So I spent a few years drooling over the books I bought, creating hundreds of characters that would never be used, and playing adventures in my mind. <br/><br/>It wasn't until 2009 or so (age ~24) that I got to play in a real campaign, which happened to be Burning Wheel run by my buddy <a href="/forums/profile/cathexis">@cathexis</a>. To this day I can't have a conversation about games with him without him saying something I don't understand. Happens to me at conventions, too. But I don't mind it - it helps me grow as a gamer. But yeah, it wasn't until adulthood that it actually became a hobby as opposed to a fantasy. (Though, in keeping with my roots, I still occasionally have fun making characters for games that I'll likely never get to play...)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417445/#Comment_417445" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T11:05:24+00:00" title="June 28, 2013 11:05AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2013 11:06AM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd never played an RPG when I ran D&amp;D 3.5 at the age of 23.
