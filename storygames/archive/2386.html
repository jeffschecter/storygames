Whatever the GM sets it to be: I suggest Poor [5] or Average [7] for most typical uses.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>In that regard, is any ability/power use just a simple or complicated situation?</blockquote>
If you want more power usage, allow their use as simple situations -- then number of Soul Points is the prime governor for most uses. If you want a little less power use, make every use a complicated situation -- then number of Soul Points AND random chance of dicerolls become governors.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>And, finally, in simple/complicated situations: Am I right that I am just arbitrarily picking one of the Difficulty Ranks (5, 7, 9, 11, 13)?</blockquote>
Yup.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Edit - Also, does Healing work differently than the other powers?</blockquote>
All of the Powers have weird little fillips to them. Recall that there's a difference between Abilities and Powers -- mostly, Powers cost Soul Points.<br/><br/>Did that help?<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>I'm not the Monkey King but that looks right to me, except that Failure Ranks are temporary (minor scrapes &amp; contusions, embarrassment, discouragement, etc.) and Damage Ranks are more lasting (typically, physical injury--brain-searing Encounters with Gibbering Masses from Beyond might be Damage Ranks too).</p>
<p>It looks as if, as written, Powers and Abilities are technically always Complicated Situations, since their descriptions include the text ". . . with a successful roll against Type Rank . . . " Second Sight is the only exception: it can be used passively.</p>
<p>An ambiguous area I can think of is using a Power or Ability in a Conflict Situation. Does that require an activation roll, and then rolling the Power/Ability against some defending Quality, Power, or Ability? Reading a bit, it looks like no--normally you're always rolling against a GM-set difficulty.</p>

                            JB, I think spiritual conflicts use the same kind of active defense that regular conflicts do. I doubt we'll be getting into that tomorrow, though, and its simple to check up on if we do.<br/><br/>So, my final question:<br/><br/>Does one spend the Soul Points for a Power before or after their Type Rank roll? If they fail their Type Rank roll, are the resources just... wasted?<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: When Improving a Quality, you need to spend Type Ranks equal to the Modifier of the next Rank of that Quality. Does this mean that the difference between an Expert [+4] Dead Inside and an Average [+0] Dead Inside is 2 ranks, and thus making that shift would allow me to increase a quality to +2?                        </div>

Yes.

I'd actually do it the other way: make the roll, and if they succeed, they spend the Soul Point.<br/><br/>I'd also consider allowing 1 Soul Point to heal *all* Failure Ranks or 1d6 Damage Ranks -- I think it might be too expensive.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>And, with Healing, if they had spent a base of 2 Soul Points (plus modifiers for Real World, etc) then the roll against the Type Rank (with no bonuses to their score), and if they succeed I allow them to heal 1d6 downshifts.

I believe they only need to spend 1 SP, unless it's in the RW, in which case there's also a DS to the roll.<br/><br/>I suggest finding a Time or Place of Power to minimize Downshifts and Soul Point costs if folks wanna do healing in the Real World.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

Right.

Right. In a conflict, the difficulty is the other guy's roll.<br/><br/>For using a Power or Ability in a conflict, I'd just use the "activation roll" as the attack/defense roll, too. So you'd roll once for Change Others and spend your Soul Points, and the defender could dodge or Ward or whatever.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

Personally, I think you roll after, and if you fail, no points are spent. But I believe in a forgiving Cosmos.<br/><br/>You could have a bleaker Cosmos if you had to spend points even if you failed.<br/><br/>You could have a medium bleak Cosmos by mixing and matching the two... and depending on how you do it, you could end up with interesting flavors. Compare a Cosmos containing a Spirit World where failure isn't penalized, but a Real World where it is, to a Cosomos with a Spirit World where failure is penalized, but a Real World where it is not.
