I was wondering if something Fiasco-like for an initial setup would be helpful.  Another element I'd like to add is something like a literal countdown clock: the runners all have a watch that is counting down to a Very Bad Thing, said thing to be determined through a series of questions.  So in addition to escaping the Chasers the runners have something they need to do other than discover who they are.<br/><br/>Also if anyone's tried either of these things I'd love to know what you did and what your experience was.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410705/#Comment_410705" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-28T13:07:49+00:00" title="March 28, 2013  1:07PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Almost every play of PSI*Run I have done was GMless. The big thing to remember is to never let the group get settled. If you wind up in a situation where there is nothing important to do for the characters to do you wind up with weak story. Our house rule is that if you don't end your scene with something to do in your next turn the other players get to invent a danger. <br/><br/>The other thing to remember is that your audience is the group, so play to what you know they will find interesting. Since the danger is all controllable color feel free to pile it on to whatever level makes you happy, but without some danger the story becomes less exciting. <br/><br/>And the answer mechanic is very important as the countdown clock. It can be fun to fail certain rolls to take answers, since that makes the story evolve. Another house rule is that you only get to answer a question yourself if you put a six in, otherwise the other players answer the question. <br/><br/>My favorite thing about PSI*Run is that it makes you think not "What is the optimal play?" but "What would be the coolest outcome of the scene given these dice?"                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410711/#Comment_410711" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-28T13:38:23+00:00" title="March 28, 2013  1:38PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you have players take turns being Guides, right?

Rotating GMs when one GM thinks it's a tense and serious mystery game and one thinks it's a gonzo shoot-em-up game and one thinks it's all about the internal relationships of the PCs can be a little confusing - unless you all know ahead of time that's what you're signing on for."  And that "The big thing to watch for in rotating GMships in PsiRun is mostly covered in the section about Co-GMing in the book; consistency in the big picture and agreement on the Chasers. Where a straight-up rotation could run into problems is if there is a need for the big picture to be secret, so make the Chasers methods and agendas really out in the open - have Amalgamated Megacorp; Chemical Research Division on the side of the van they crash in, give them a laptop full of email exchanges with a Special Ops branch of the military, and create at the table pictures of the Chasers."<br/><br/>I think it's probably OK to have everyone piece together what the Chasers are up to over the course of the game rather than reveal it all at the start, as long as Meg's first bit of advice above is taken into account, and everyone is clear that you can't impose your own big picture on to everyone, it's going to be collaborative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
