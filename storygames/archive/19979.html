He sent around an email which pitched the game as Jon (the stag) trying to rescue his kidnapped bride-to-be and the rest of us trying to stop him. That's a little different from the original game. In fact, it is inverted - instead of a single GM (Doctor Magnethands) presenting challenges for the rest of the group to overcome, it is one player overcoming challenges set by the rest of the group. I have written up my hack of the game on my blog.<br/><br/>You can read it <a href="http://weaving-stories.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/neverending-backpack-hack-of-doctor.html#more" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'd welcome comments, questions and suggestions. Probably best to keep them here on Story Games so we can have the conversation in one place - I've put the main body on my blog because I feel like a blog is a more permanent place to put things.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gshowitt" title="gshowitt"><img alt="gshowitt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gshowitt">gshowitt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441874/#Comment_441874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T14:25:02+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  2:25PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, glad this ridiculous game is still making people happy!<br/><br/>I ran a Doctor Magnethands LARP at a con a couple of months back.
