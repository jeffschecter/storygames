Johan is a warrior by trade and an NPC.  How do we game this?<br/><br/>Because the rules are player facing the hireling mechanics come to mind.  They work in an interesting way, as a modifier to the rolls the players make.  If i game Johan as a warrior, he can improve other characters doing hack and slash moves...  The problem i am having is <b>how to represent actions taken independantly by Johan</b>.  (What if he is in a dangerous combat by himself and not helping someone else?) <b>and actions which are not related to fighting </b>(what if johan tries to save someone who is drowing?) <br/><br/>I am wondering how we can game PC allies.  I am finding that this is the weakest part of dungeon world so far.  There are lots of moments when Johan isn't going to directly aid another person in a battle what would then fictionally justify a bonus to the roll to help, how do i adjuciate this, do you suppose i fiat the outcome based on the fictional decisions being made or what?  <br/><br/>Also, and lastly, i realize that the player characters are the heroes and i am not suggesting that johan will be stealing their spotlight, but even so, there are times when the above circumstances will occur.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435564/#Comment_435564" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T13:05:50+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  1:05PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'd just follow the Principles and Agenda and the previously-established fiction.

Make the character look useful by doing his part of the work, use it as a last resort to save the PCs. By last resort I mean that once all PCs had spotlight trying to do something and fail, let them try again trough Johan, but let them roll the dice. Also, let the players re-introduce it in the fiction ("What's Johan doing now that we're in town?" "We're going to drink, is Johan there?") again and again. Once every couple sessions have him state what he thinks about something. Its these kind of NPCs that make themselves likeable by the players, at the point that they start to invest on them, get to know him and take care of him.<br/><br/>If he doesn't do anything, nor says much, he's bound to became a disposable meat shield.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435568/#Comment_435568" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T14:20:10+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  2:20PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Johan is taking actions that the PCs aren't involved in, ask yourself: what would happen? What <i>should</i> happen in this situation, given the setting I have been describing to the players in this game so far? Look at your agendas and your principles again and decide what the most likely, logical, probable outcome is. Then describe that happening.<br/><br/>Probably the reason this looks like a weak part of the game is because it sort of is -- or rather it's not part of the "game" at all. Dungeon World is about the PCs and their adventures, full stop. That's it. It's not about what their buddies get up to when they're not around. That's just an element of the setting and the situations that the GM introduces to the players/PCs, but not part of the "game" elements.<br/><br/>Of course, they included some game elements for steadings in DW that you can use to decide what happens when the PCs aren't around, and you can use things that are similar to help you decide. Like, if Johan's warrior skill is 3+, maybe that means he can defeat 3HP monsters on his own, so long as he isn't swarmed. Or, you can turn the question back on the players, like "Are you sure you want to send Johan after that orc? Do you really think he can take it on all alone?" Maybe the Fighter will explain why she thinks Johan can handle it, given his previous experiences in the game. Well, she's the Fighter, she should know, right? Take that into account.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's your decision as the GM though. It's not a wargame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435577/#Comment_435577" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T16:07:06+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  4:07PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2014 4:07PM by cupbearer11.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah these are awesome ideas.
