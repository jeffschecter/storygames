I really want to knock their socks off. I really want both Sarah and Nikki to be regular players. I know there are lots of issues there, and I'd like to discuss them, but not now.<br/><br/>I'm going to be using a slightly modified Wheel of FATE for the adventure.<br/><br/>They are going to be playing supposedly prim-and-proper victorian ladies who are actually investigators from either a private or church-run organization. They've been hired by an agency that places governesses because several young women have disappeared from one client's employ under mysterious circumstances.<br/><br/>I need the who, what, why, and how. Who is the villian? Why are they disappearing? How are the children involved? Etc...<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oh! Forgot.

It sounds like exactly the kind of advice I'd give someone else. I'd really love to ask them, but I have a feeling they'll be easier to "evangelize" into becoming regular players if I have at least a rough idea of what's happening so the game can run smoothly. I think they'll enjoy participating in a mystery rather than helping to author one.<br/><br/>This is a one-shot game, and we'll be doing chargen this evening. I'm going to suggest pretty girls who were at one time street walkers (possibly victimized by evil men) and were rehabilitated and trained by the organization. This will ensure both positive and negative aspects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148573/#Comment_148573" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T07:48:25+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  7:48AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>The governesses are actually being recruited into a fanatical secret society of assassins who eliminates anyone who shows the slightest sign of disloyalty to the Queen.

Being calm cool and collected with a so so story seems alot better to me than being flat and erratic with a great one. Just my own personal preference but as far as "good times" go , that's my two cents. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your fantasy story, I think you need a complication on the fighting order of st. patrick and st.michael.

A tea party is involved.  As are dolls and doll-houses.  The children, three girls, naturally, are triplets.  The house originally belonged to their grand-aunt--before she moved away to Salem.
