If you don't yet know about Dreamation, consider coming. It will be held Jan 24-27 in East Brunswick, NJ and has a great scene for indie gaming.<br/><br/>For gms taking part in the IGE, they are waiving some requirements since we are coordinating it as a group. They ask that each gm run at least 3 games with 4 or more players during the weekend. Perks this gives are access to a staff suite with food, a free room we can share and free admission to the event.  <br/><br/>To register as part of the IGE:<br/><br/>1) post (or whisper to me) information about your 3 or more games to <b>this thread</b>, answering the questions listed below.<br/><br/>2) join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/indie-games-explosion?hl=en" rel="nofollow">IGE google group</a> and add your games to the schedule there on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/indie-games-explosion/web/games-list?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Games List</a>.<br/><br/>If you want to register the games yourself or don't want to post the info here, email me at keirgreeneyes+at+yahoo+com<br/><br/>Thank you! I'll post the info needed next.<br/><br/>[Edited: please note edit to above]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108107/#Comment_108107" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-13T11:33:19+00:00" title="November 13, 2007 11:33AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2007 11:53AM by Emily_Care.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feel free to cut and paste this with your info: <br/><br/>Name:<br/>Email:<br/>Age:<br/>Gender:<br/>Street Address:<br/>City, State Zip:<br/>Daytime phone:<br/>After 6 pm phone:<br/><br/>For each game:<br/><br/>Game Title:<br/>Email address for pre-con questions (optional):<br/>Description of game:<br/>System and version #:<br/># of hours for the game:<br/>If this is in a series (of games), which number is it?
