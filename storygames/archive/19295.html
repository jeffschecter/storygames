If one goes with the idea that the Wars of the Roses were the model for Martin's stories, that also makes Hadrian's Wall an obvious analogue for The Wall: it was a guard against the Pictish raiders from the North. The strong animal heraldry is very possibly a direct influence picked up from L5R; I'm not aware that English houses were often connected with disparate animals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429752/#Comment_429752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-22T18:59:23+00:00" title="March 22, 2014  6:59PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2014 7:01PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Common sources, shared genre and coincidence explain it. Both works use well-known historical romance tropes, in a way that is traditional and hangs well together to facilitate court drama. Both works also incidentally happen to have pretty clear derivations from amusingly similar historical inspirations: one is all about post-Roman Britain as Carpe notes, while the other is about China with its big wall and Japan with its feudal pressure kettle politics. It's funny how both of those can look so similar when viewed from sufficient distance, through a genre that emphasizes the similarities.<br/><br/>I would be surprised if there was any direct inspiration or influence from L5R to the Song of of Ice and Fire, simply because both of those settings are creatively entirely natural to come up with from first principles. It would be much more of a stretch, at least for me, to take L5R as a starting point and then adapt it into a western setting. I can definitely see the point for doing vanilla post-Roman Britain fantasy like Martin did, while painstakingly adapting L5R's setup into a different milieu doesn't seem like an useful or compelling creative project at all.<br/><br/>Also note that your list really has only two independent similarities: the wall is one, and the court drama is the other, and together they're just unique enough to make this comparison interesting. The number of high noble houses is coincidence, just like the animal heraldry: both are obvious poetic elements (numerology and relatable heraldic devices, respectively) to go for when doing historical romance of this sort. Might as well speculate about a connection with <i>Battletech</i> or something - it's more difficult to name a feudalistic romance that doesn't have a numerological number of great houses and cool heraldry than it is to name those that do.<br/><br/>This trope family of "court drama on the better side of the barbarian wall" reminds me of another similar phenomenon in genre literature, <i>Stalker</i>. Aside from the Strugatsky novel <i>Roadside Picnic</i>, we've seen the same idea of "limited alien zone supports a culture of adventurers" in Glorantha (Pavis and the Big Rubble), <i>Lesserton and Mor</i> (an OSR module), <i>Maschine Zeit</i> (same thing in space), <i>Space Hulk</i> (ditto) and <i>Praedor</i> (a Finnish comic book series and rpg, that one), at the very least. Just like the case with the great wall myth, this one about an alien zone of adventure is also reasonable coherent as a literary trope, enough so as to draw attention whenever it's used. And just like the great wall myth, this is <i>just</i> on the edge of coincidence: it's unique enough to make one consider a direct influence, but the fact is that while some of those works are explicitly influenced, others equally clearly aren't - it's just a compelling enough idea that it can be, and has been, reinvented several times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429755/#Comment_429755" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T00:48:47+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 12:48AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Martin has written about translating RPG play into fiction, that being the direct source material for the <i>Wild Cards</i> anthology series he developed, in an essay in Noah Wardrip Fruin and Pat Harrigan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Second-Person-Role-Playing-Story-Playable/dp/0262514184" rel="nofollow">Second Person: Role-Playing and Story in Games and Playable Media</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429765/#Comment_429765" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T09:51:29+00:00" title="March 23, 2014  9:51AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the input!<br/><br/>What's really odd is: I've owned Second Person for YEARS, but never did I realize that he contributed to it. Thanks for the hint! Also thanks for taking the time and deconstructing all of this. I do also think that sometimes similarities arise out of logical/thematic seeds rather than through copying.<br/><br/>I even have my own game as example, because many folks do indeed think that it was inspired by Mouse Guard. Small fluffy creatures with cloaks and going out on adventures. It's always a point to discuss with geeks who know MG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
