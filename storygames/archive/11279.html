We're playing a western show called Pond Creek. We'll play episode four tonight, out of five. This might only be interesting to us, but Next Week On is a potent tool and it's interesting to see it laid out in one place. You can see early choices guiding later play, for sure. Do you use Next Week On? For games other than PTA? Do yours resemble ours? <br/><br/><b>After the pilot, Next Week On Pond Creek, Episode One:</b><br/><br/>- Doc Valentine playing poker with Mayor Lodge <br/>- Judge Tyler telling Max Parrish "I've purchased your deed" <br/>- Judge Tyler, backed into a corner, pleading for his life <br/>- Judge Tyler and his Henchmen in Old Man McPhee's bedroom; "You better leave now, Maggie" <br/>- Maggie McPhee unpacking her mother's wedding dress <br/>- Harkins alone on a horse, watching someone else occupying his ranch <br/>- Gainer Sparks arrives in Pond Creek on a coach <br/><br/><b>Next Week On Pond Creek, Episode Two:</b><br/><br/>- Harkins and Valentine meet in the woods; "the white man he can trust" <br/>- Moonlight on the prairie; Harkins and Maggie embrace <br/>- Lodge, sweating and nervous: "I've never done an amputation before" <br/>- Max and Selma: "I'm gonna have to kill some men, Selma" <br/>- King Davis comes to Valentine with a bloodied Maggie <br/>- Harkins, barricaded in the McPhee ranch house, rifle in hand <br/><br/><b>Next Week On Pond Creek, Episode Three:</b><br/><br/>- Judge Tyler talking to Harkins in what passes for a jail cell <br/>- A monster of a man walks into the Bradshaw; "Name's Deal - Karl Deal" <br/>- Gaynor Sparks holding a letter; "Yep, that's my real name" <br/>- Gaynor Sparks showing a letter to Maggie McPhee <br/>- King Davis searching the "empty" house of Max Parrish <br/>- Gaynor and King Davis testifying as witnesses<br/><br/><b>Next Week On Pond Creek, Episode Four:</b><br/><br/>- Selma comes to town, a gun to her head <br/>- Harkins gets measured for a coffin before the trial <br/>- Judge on the stand, drinking his "medicine" <br/>- Parrish settles things with Dubbs <br/>- Gainer, Maggie and the Judge at the kitchen table - a family meeting <br/>- A mob slips a noose over the neck of a hooded man, while another man watches <br/>- Parrish pulls a gun; Maggie: "Not in this house, Max Parrish!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250510/#Comment_250510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T13:17:04+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  1:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Whaaaa?</p>\n<p>I'm <em>so</em> re-reading PTA tonight.</p>\n<p>My gut is terrified.

Some stuff gets dropped without any harm. Usually halfway through a session we check in to see if there's anything we could (or should) bring in. That usually takes the form of "You realize Maggie and Harkins are supposed to hook up this week, right?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250527/#Comment_250527" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T14:20:56+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  2:20PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my old PTA game with time traveling squirrels, delinquent Victorian school girls, and blonde American cheerleaders, we did use the Next Week On... mechanic. But I seem to recall we described the shot montage for the following week - so it was more of a mystery what might happen. <br/><br/>The squirrel elder would be "talking" about such and such headmistress, or the cheerleader would be hanging from a tree, or the girls would be running in a field at night. <br/><br/>Which did make it harder to re-incorporate, but on the whole we did our best.<br/><br/>In my more recent PTA game for Torchwood: Abdi, that feel entirely by the wayside. But I spent most of that game as the producer heinously abusing PTA to producing something remotely like the play experience the players wanted - which alas was not what we had originally discussed when we selected PTA for the game. <br/><br/>In season two of Torchwood: Abdi, I hacked a combination of PTA, unknown armies, and inspectres, with some design elements entirely of my own. Interestingly enough we did plan out the basic idea of each episode before hand, but still no Next Week On... Part of the reason for that was we didn't have time to do a proper series, and were aiming for a Children of Earth style mini-series focusing on the sleeper aliens presented in an episode of season two of Torchwood. For a longer game, I think the PTA hack I developed may find it useful.<br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250529/#Comment_250529" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T14:21:39+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  2:21PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2010 2:33PM by nemomeme.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the PTA games I've played, our group seemed to like to have about half of the "Next Week Ons" be really specific, (X named character looms over Y named character and says "I've purchased your deed"), but not providing much context, and about half be dramatic and <i>seemingly specific</i> visually but actually leave a lot of wiggle room as to what is happening or to whom. (it's not necessarily clear how badly hurt character Z is or whether it was character X or Y that was doing the shooting, etc)<br/><br/>I think we've had close to a 90% "success rate" of working those scenes/moments though we've occasionally had to resort to a dream sequence to explain the dramatic event.  That may sound cheesier than it was in practice; our Carnivale-esque show in particular had a lot of dreams and dreamlike scenes that felt entirely appropriate to the genre.<br/><br/>It's definitely a fun and important part of PTA; self-imposed constraint that breeds creativity, a seeding of what you'd like to see happen at the next session, and a helpful memory and/or "kick-you-into-gear" aid for when you next get together. <br/><br/>Powerful stuff.<br/><br/>edit: we haven't really done "Next Time On" for other games but we always send e-mails after each session with players talking about what they liked about the session  and such and often what they'd like to see more of next session, sometimes with a fair amount of specificity.<br/><br/>For our Diaspora game on Sunday, one of the characters prevented a woman from being stoned and the other two PCs had strong opinions about the whole event that didn't get explored much.  I asked that we have our characters next time talk with one another about their relationships with women, both specific and more generally; one of them is a romantic who is searching for his lost love while the other two are likely coming into conflict over a woman soon and I think we need to foreshadow the possible nature of that conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250592/#Comment_250592" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T04:25:08+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  4:25AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's how last night's session went, to compare to our Next Week On intentions:<br/><br/>- Harkins gets measured for a coffin before the trial<br/>- Judge on the stand, drinking his "medicine"<br/>- Parrish settles things with Dubbs<br/>- A mob slips a noose over the neck of a hooded man, while another man watches<br/>This stuff all happened as intended.<br/><br/>- Gainer, Maggie and the Judge at the kitchen table - a family meeting<br/>This did not happen at all.<br/><br/>- Selma comes to town, a gun to her head<br/>Selma showed up, in peril. No gun to head but the intention was preserved.<br/><br/>- Parrish pulls a gun; Maggie: "Not in this house, Max Parrish!" <br/>This happened, but only because somebody brought it up and we did a quick, easy retcon during a scene.<br/><br/>These results seem very typical for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
