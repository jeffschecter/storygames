I've read through the book and the Reference Sheets a few times, feel fairly confident about the mechanics. What advice would those of you who have Monsterhearts experience give to someone running it for the first time? Anything I should keep in mind? Something you realized after playing the game that you wish you had thought of at the start?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402122/#Comment_402122" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-29T19:43:19+00:00" title="December 29, 2012  7:43PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ask a lot of questions, especially about strings.

I found first time out I didn't get to use the Mortal shut down move 'Mess with me, mess with him' because it kind of needs them to be in small scenes in trouble. In the one shot they just didn't seem to come up because we were pushing play along. Knowing that, I chose moves more carefully in the next one shot I played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
