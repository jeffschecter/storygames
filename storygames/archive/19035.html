In Fiasco, it doesn\u2019t feel at all like cheating if I\u2019m handed a fail die and have to narrate failure even in situations where there is a diegetic chance of success. I\u2019ve also looked at Apocalypse World, where, as far as I understand it, diegetic concerns don\u2019t really change the mechanical target numbers in the roll\u2014it may change the consequences of the roll, and whether or not a roll is even possible to make, but it\u2019s always the same 2\u20136, 7\u20139, 10\u201312 ranges.<br/><br/>We\u2019ve had such good experiences with Fiasco that I\u2019m not at all married to a primarily Karma-based style anymore.<br/><br/>I just have a hard time understanding the chapter. It just seems crazily arbitrary. I\u2019d like a strict procedure on how to set difficulties in any situation.<br/>Either based on story beats, or based on diegetic concerns, or a workable combination of both.<br/>I think there <i>is</i> a clear method to be extracted from the book\u2014I just haven\u2019t found it yet. Any ideas?<br/><br/>Generally, I want to move more to procedural or algorithmic GMing. That doesn\u2019t mean the fiction\u2014I love the freedom to narrate and come up with any fictional idea\u2014but it does mean in the numbers. For some weird reason, my brain, when asked \u201cWho is standing in the hallway\u201d can come up with many ideas, but when asked for hard numbers to input directly into the game\u2019s mechanics, hits a wall. It\u2019s like playing a variant of bridge or poker where one side has pre-printed cards but the other has blank cards and a pen.<br/>It\u2019s not mathematical ineptutide\u2014I\u2019ve got the 1 4 10 16 19 etc sequence down pat, and generally am familiar with 4dF probability\u2014it\u2019s more a sense of arbitrariness or meaninglessness.<br/><br/>Speaking of Fate Core, the one thing I would like to change is to make the guidelines for creating Scenarios and Scenes explicit, with worksheets similar to the \u201cgame creation\u201d worksheet, where the GM writes down their story questions and issues.<br/><br/>A friend mentioned that he might want to GM Fate Core and I was surprised at my own reaction\u2014rather than \u201cwow, cool! sign me up!\u201d, I reacted with fear as my thoughts went to murk and trad-play with some Fate Core surface trappings added, rather than \u201cplay to find out\u201d.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve seen so many takes on Fate Core over the last few weeks and it seems like everyone has their own read on it. I come at it from it wanting to take cues from AW, with fronts and moves creating the situations dynamically based on player actions, but I\u2019ve seen some scenarios that at first glance (I need to read them more carefully) look very traddy.<br/><br/>I especially want to combine \u201cfront\u201d-style play with CrimeWorld style play (from Worlds in Shadow). I.e. rather than presenting a scenario where you drop the PCs in saying \u201cYou need to do this and that\u201d, have them find their own needs (due to story and game issues) and build the heist or con around that.<br/>I don\u2019t know.<br/>I guess I\u2019m painting myself more and more into a corner with my almost autistic desire for clarity, algorithms, and strictness.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425047/#Comment_425047" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T03:52:46+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  3:52AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate is a pretty loose game, it mixes trad and proge influences and in general attempts to respond to expectations and preconceptions of whoever is reading it. I don't really think that it has any dominant structural reasons for choosing one method over another in this regard - depends on what you're trying to do with it. It can range from the style of newest Heroquest ("the GM has a plot and determines difficulties to favour success and failure at appropriate times") to the style of TSoY ("all difficulties are derived from situational facts on the ground, and the dice determine the outcomes").<br/><br/>One type of strict procedure from the latter end of the spectrum would be to have the passive opposition always be +2 for each clearly contrary aspect of the situation, with base at zero. This accords with the idea that you can activate an aspect to provide a +2 passive resistance to action (that's in the book somewhere, I'm sure), and it clearly verbalizes the expectation that PCs will mostly succeed in what they attempt, unless there are clear, enumerable aspects to the situation that make success unlikely. One might assume that the vast majority of the time at most 1-2 aspects would be directly opposing the action.<br/><br/>One might of course ask how this'd relate to the aspect-activation scheme in general - would it now be unnecessary to activate situational aspects for resistance, if they provide resistance merely by existing, or could you double up by paying for it as well? The obvious interpretation is that passive resistance derived in this manner consists of "free activations" of the aspects that are clearly contrary to the action; any further aspects then would have be paid for normally with Fate points to add them to the resistance.<br/><br/>Of course all this isn't too useful if one also has difficulty deciding what fictional details should count as Aspects, and if it is unclear when an Aspect is clearly opposing an action and when it is merely available for activation. Maybe this could be improved upon in some way with a little thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425050/#Comment_425050" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T06:09:18+00:00" title="December  2, 2013  6:09AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2013 6:10AM by 2097.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One might of course ask how this'd relate to the aspect-activation scheme in general - would it now be unnecessary to activate situational aspects for resistance, if they provide resistance merely by existing, or could you double up by paying for it as well?</blockquote>\nI think they removed this problem in one of the later drafts. Now aspects that are in your way just block you. You can invoke it to add to your rolls, not to subtract from theirs. You can also pay to compel them. (I guess I need more practice and clarity with compels, too\u2026)<br/><br/>Let\u2019s say the aspect is \u201cSuper-heavy fallen bookcase\u201d.

Setting difficulty levels is a judgment call, and there's a lot of data that feeds into it. One of those data points is your own free will choice. :-)<br/><br/>You're supposed to keep in mind what setting particularly high or low difficulties will do, but later it tells you <i>"If the only reason for setting a difficulty at Superb (+5) is because it\u2019s two higher than the PC\u2019s skill level and you want to bleed his fate points off, you strain credibility."</i> So it needs to be a consideration, but you should ultimately root difficulty levels in the fiction, still.<br/><br/>Start with the fiction ("It's very dark, so trying to find the creature is probably around +5 to +6"), mix in a sense of the dramatic effect you're trying to get ("I don't want this to be crushingly hard, so I'll eyeball it for the lower end"), and put it all together ("So, I think I'll set it at +5"). Setting Fate Core difficulties is about cultivating an awareness of what certain levels of difficulties will do, and then using that awareness to inform your difficulty levels. Estimate what the difficulty should be, know what effect nudging the difficulty up or down will have, and then figure out your decision from those factors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425083/#Comment_425083" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T07:22:48+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  7:22AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would look at those difficulty guidelines more as a kind of "wondering why your PCs aren't feeling particularly challenged when you're fielding only Good (+2) challenges against their apex Great (+4) skills?" rosetta stone. I think if you apply them straight up to an individual PC, and hit the "If the only reason..." rationale as part of it, sure, you're running into some trouble. <br/><br/>But step back and think about how it's a commentary on a PC group more than any one individual PC. Within a reasonably skill-diverse PC group you're probably going to see at least one guy operating at a Good or Great skill in the field of most of the passive opposition challenges you might throw their way. Thinking about it from that perspective, applying the setting difficulties guideline to this "SOMEbody's gonna have at least a Good" model will probably produce the right kind of spread, without it being like you're picking on or bending things to keep it challenging for one specific character.<br/><br/>There's also another element that CarpeGuitarrem is touching on, where once you've gone through the "what does this look like for a generalized Good skill vs this challenge?" exercise (Superb = truly difficult FP bleeder, Good = requires competence and a little luck, Average = pretty damn easy) you can start making connections between fiction and those suggested difficulty levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425084/#Comment_425084" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T07:30:34+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  7:30AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot also depends on how hard you want the game to be.
