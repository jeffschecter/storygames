We had to pry it's mouth open with a spear.  The cleric tried the best he could, but somewhere inside my knee there's still a tooth lodged.  It wakes me up at night with visions, sometimes, especially when there are dragons about.  It's also causing something foul to seep into my blood, slowly, not enough to kill me dead, but sometimes, in the heat of battle, my knee burns and I have trouble walking, but a blind rage boils up inside of me and I can't stop until everyone else is dead.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147060/#Comment_147060" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-01T00:15:06+00:00" title="June  1, 2008 12:15AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was talking with Eric Boyd tonight and the movie Mountains of the Moon came up which includes a wonderful scene of Richard Burton, the explorer not the actor, and Stanley, of "Livingston I presume", conmparing scars. The scene is priceless and I brought it up in a similar light. it would be a wonderfuladdition to any game for the scars you carry to tell tales as well as drag you down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
