We're kinda on hiatus right now becuase of my rather chaotic schedule, but it was going pretty well. HQRPG does have some definite advancement mechanics, but not in the way most of the fantasy games do - while you do get to increase your number of talents, adding new occupations doesn't really let you keep the specialties or implied abilities of older occupations. Instead, it's assumed that after a while, you get rusty with your old occupation, and eventually it doesn't provide any advantage.<br/><br/>But so far, the players had been pretty happy with that. They were seeing it as a way to change their character's abilities based on what they thought would be more important (though none of these things involve fighting monsters or ruling kingdoms).<br/><br/>At some point, I'll have an AP posted, but it requires that I first get all my notes in some semblance of order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338964/#Comment_338964" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T18:24:38+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  6:24PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is probably slightly off from what you are looking for but:<br/><a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Books" rel="nofollow">Lone Wolf</a> book series - simple mechanics, solo (well there is a multiplayer version now), meant for campaign, some advancement<br/><br/><a href="http://fabledlands.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Fabled Lands</a> solo books and now a multiplayer game.
