Right? <br/><br/>Drama in Everway I understand as: Introduce elements, objects or outcomes <i>in order to </i>ensure satisfying story beats (both pre-planned and not).<br/>I emphasized "in order to" because Drama is a resolution method, where as Railgnusto (as per <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/riss-1.4.1" rel="nofollow">RISS 1.4.1</a>, maybe this will change) is about the act of <i>pre-writing</i> story beats. So Drama can <i>help</i> ensure that Railgnusto's pre-written beats come to pass.<br/><br/>Fortune in Everway is introducing a random element from a closed multifaceted set (the Fortune Deck; cards have many aspect such as positive/negative, which element they're associated with / beneficial for, deities in the game world etc etc) and then rifffing off that. Not really a strict RISS match. Not really that different from rolling on a random encounter table or trinket table in OSR...? But where the random table introduces an element, the fortune card is more likely to introduce an outcome or event (elements are more often introduced with the other deck; the vision cards).<br/><br/><small>James: Karma, Drama and Fortune are resolution systems from the game Everway. Fortune Cards and Vision Cards are mechanics in that game. OSR stands for (in this context) a type of play with a prepped location and random tables to introduce elements, allies or adversaries. A closed set is when you have a some items (in this case cards in a deck) and then you stick to those items and don't add more.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462892/#Comment_462892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-04T03:30:54+00:00" title="May  4, 2017  3:30AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2017 3:31AM by Stephen P.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (You probably don't need to address the terminological explanations to James. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I mean, they're really for all the lurkers or future readers who may not have followed the dense intertext between recent threads, or who didn't frequent the Forge, or whatever.
