The idea is to try to flip the mechanics towards a fairy tale type story with a push and pull between the fae and the real world. <br/><br/>We're going to try to "playstorm" this hack next Monday and see how it goes.  Right now i'm just riffing on things and would love to hear some feedback on how to shoehorn DRYH mechanics.  Right now what we're looking for in a game is: a sort of Gaiman 'Stardust', Delieria, Princess Bride, Zorcerrer of Zo, Alice in Wonderland, Labrynth, Brian Froud, Phantom Tollbooth, Winnie the Pooh, and a Changeling experience.<br/><br/>Initial notes towards a scenario:\n<blockquote>Don't Lose Your Innocence<br/><br/>Just beyond the daffodils\u2013further, to where the lilting breeze stops short and the blue sky can finally stand no more is a place where the clouds cough black and the trees bend and writhe, there sits a merciless kingdom.  A timeless land of passionless fugue, filled with graying sun and a hoarse wind.  At its heart, a city of rusty spires and spidery ramparts.  It is a place all children recall from feverish dreams and whispered in hickory switches, a place called the Goblin Market.<br/> <br/>\tHere, metal turbines gnash and burr with a most horrible shriek.  These worn gears and cogs pound the pulse of the city.  Since the dawn of time, These mills have served one purpose: to grind the hopes and dreams of children.  <br/> <br/>\tWithin an airless, dank chamber glows the eyes of the Goblin King.  Stolid and small, his mouth filled with teeth\u2013and those teeth filled with teeth\u2013the Goblin King takes a dram of a fine powder into his fist.  This powder is the only product the Goblin Market produces.  It smells of castor oil, burnt tar, old shoes and pepper.  It is twice as fine as water and ten times hotter than live coals.  It is said that it is made with tears and promises.  Centuries have perfected the process of production.  There is more of this stuff than there is oxygen to breath.<br/><br/>\tThe Goblin King licks his cracked dry lips and snorts violently at the air.  In this instance, his joy is as undeniable as it is horrible to witness.  <br/><br/>\tThe Goblin Market accepts no coin and yet it trades all day.  The Goblin King licks his scaly paw and blows the dust into the air where it hisses and pops before it dissipates into the same sticky fog that pervades this land.  Just a pinch of this stuff was enough to sunder glittering Camelot; they say a spoonful caused the stars to cry for forty days and nights; and the very mention of it is enough to render the inevitable to impossible.  This is where they manufacture Doubt.  </blockquote>\ninstead of insomnia / insanity.  i'm trying to frame the discussion around wonder and innocence in against a land of doubt and disillusion.  <br/><br/>i've only just recently looked at the DRYH mechanics.  Jeff Coyler, John Lammers and Rustin Simons will also be on board.  At least two of them have played the game before and will have a better idea of what's needed there.  <br/><br/>In the meantime, I'd love to hear any advice about the hack or how to handle it. <br/><br/>thanks,<br/><br/>eric                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179126/#Comment_179126" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T09:58:24+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  9:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2008 4:51PM by Double King.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            some additional Jeff notes on the project:<br/><br/>What I like about all these stories  -<br/><br/>- They have interesting characters that are changing<br/><br/>- there is magic, but its not used to solve every problem, nor is might usually wits, heart, and love save the day<br/><br/>- Things are dark, but not oppressively so its a trip to the Goblin Castle, not Hell<br/><br/>- its usually about ordinary people in extraordinary places or events its interesting if the farmboy slays the dragon, or better yet befriends<br/>  dragon.  But its not so interesting if one dragon kills another. In that sense its almost anti-fantasy, because the characters never become the big damn heroes<br/><br/>- I like stories about the characters regaining hope, love, finding faith, becoming better, or just going home.  I'm not against them having troubles, overcoming<br/>conflict, or being threatened.  <br/><br/>- I'm just partially sick of games that never lighten up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179148/#Comment_179148" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T11:34:25+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 11:34AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there D-K!<br/><br/>you know, yesterday i was puzzling over a similar situation, thinking of how to make a great fairy tale game which stays true to what i love about those stories... something i came up with was that the threat of violence is there, but if it ever occurs it turns out poorly for the protagonist, very one-sided. or at least, it's clear at the get-go whom the violence is targeting; the kids are putting the witch in the oven or the witch is putting the kids in, there's no struggle. <br/>so, thinking about games where the protagonists start off as lower status than the world around them (ie, they're on the run or are generally in danger and outnumbered and so on) i immediately thought of DRYH.<br/>and so i began joking with myself about "Don't Forget Your Manners".<br/>The name i settled on for my project was "Don't Lose The Path", though mine is hacking another game as well, taking a chunk off of the new Changeling (which i'm pretty sure <i>they</i> got from Sorcerer). i don't think i'll stay with it though: especially now that you and your crew can do work that i can benefit from! <br/><br/>what i mean to say is, i'm excited about the direction you're taking this-<br/>i'll follow the progress.<br/><br/>...i can see that annoyance with games that never lighten up. i'll add to that my annoyance with every game seeming to revolve around violence.<br/>and i <i>still</i> don't get to slaughter orcs. pfff. what the hell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179151/#Comment_179151" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T11:45:59+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 11:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jackson, <br/><br/>Must be something in the air, right?<br/><br/>Presently most of the above is in flux but we seem to be in agreement on some of the things you also point out.  I definitely think the kids need to be orphans or at least isolated like Milo in Phantom Tollbooth or Christopher Robbins in Pooh.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm floating an idea i haven't quite been able to get my head around where instead of the pcs getting direct access to magic that instead perhaps there's a cadre of magical fae npcs that are generated and assist the party.  the additional dice that the DRYH system generates would allow you to pull in these characters and let them channel additional magic on your behalf.  Like Tinkerbell taking a bullet for you or Sean Connery steps in as a fireman to dispose of the pure evil and saves the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179213/#Comment_179213" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T14:55:55+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  2:55PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2008 3:51PM by Double King.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff pointed me to this thread at <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?s=4356cad7e89429a3f95a9918a3dfe00c&amp;t=410815" rel="nofollow">rpg.net</a> <br/><br/>specifically:\n<blockquote> Fatespinner:  <br/><br/>Re: A DRYH challenge thread!<br/>Another idea is that Exhaustion maps to imagination and Madness to magic. Your imagination allows you to do things and wonders by shaping the world around you. Magic on the other hand allows you to use the native powers of the land and draws you into it...slowly making you a citizen of the land.<br/><br/>The idea is roughly based on Grimm, where kids are trapped in a world made of fairy tales. Their imagination allows them to affect the world and magic can bind them to the land.<br/><br/>With DRYH it will feel different..but more like Horror and a wierd world experience.</blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote> buddha:<br/><br/>I guess I don't see it that way... The mechanics are built to actually feed off of one another, but it's purely color that that it leads to a dark doom-laden end for our heroes... But, I guess I should put my money where my mouth is and take Scattercat's challenge!<br/><br/>Okay; Don't Rest Your YA Fantasy it is! I'm thinking the kids transported to a magical fantasy land where they become heroes sort of thing...<br/><br/>Discipline becomes Responsibility.<br/><br/>Exhaustion becomes either Maturity (if you want the game to be about growing up and putting childish things behind you) or The Dark (if you want it to be about cool adventures and finding your inner strength). I'm more interested in the adventure side of things, so I'll run with the Dark... All of the kids have heroic Talents, or Virtues, tied into the Dark Track... as the Dark rises and things get more dangerous, the kids rise to meet the challenge!<br/><br/>When The Dark increases or Dominates (every time a point gets added) some aspect of the Enemy manifests. When the Dark has fully risen (i.e. one of the kids snaps and/or the adventure reaches its conclusion) the Enemy appears! Snapping can represent the kid being defeated, going temporarily over to the Dark side, or just being caught unprepared when the Enemy attacks... It doesn't take you out of play unless you're cool with that, but it does mean you suffer the effects of "Doubt" (?) Responsibility 1 and no Talents for at least a day, and he becomes a beacon to the Dark, open to its temptations and efforts to kidnap the child.<br/><br/>Madness becomes Wonder: representing all the magic and goodness that the kids discover... naturally they find they have hidden talents and destinies, or they get nifty magical gifts since they are the "Chosen Ones".<br/><br/>When Wonder dominates something magical happens to the kid. If three magical things happen, the kid gains a point of permanent Wonder, which replaces one of their Responsibility dice. If all the kid's Responsibility becomes Wonder, they become a creature of the other world, tied to it forever and unable to go back to the real world (perhaps they become a wise and benevolent ruler, or find themselves bonded to the primeval Forest). They will become an NPC after one last adventure, perhaps to later reappear to counsel new heroes.<br/><br/>Okay... how was that? Did I miss anything? Ah, yeah, the Questions.... let's see:<br/><br/>What's been troubling you? This should be real life issues that will end up being metaphorically represented in the Fantasy World<br/>How did you and your friends come to be here? Something to tie you all together...<br/>What side of you do adults see?<br/>What would your friends say about you?<br/>What is your greatest strength? This will tie into or be your Virtue.<br/>What are your weaknesses? This is how the Dark will tempt/fool you.<br/>What's happening right now?<br/></blockquote>\nultimately that thread points back to SG, which i found amusing in its synergy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179226/#Comment_179226" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T16:07:34+00:00" title="November 18, 2008  4:07PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a cool thread.  Especially since I started working on a game about a year ago(?) that came out of Jason's Sight and Sound Design Challenge.  I had just read DRYH and thought I would riff off of it into a fairy tale type of thing.  I eventually opted for nursery rhymes to avoid similarities to Grimm from FFG.  It was called 'Don't Take a Nap' and morphed into Twisted Rhymes, Nursery Crimes.  It involves children becoming lost in The Rhymeland.  The Rhymeland is dying because no one believes or tell the rhymes anymore.  The Rhymes kidnap children and drain their imagination to power the land.  It is currently on the back burner as another game usurped it for the moment.<br/>\nDouble King said:"I like stories about the characters regaining hope, love, finding faith, becoming better, or just going home. I'm not against them having troubles, overcoming conflict, or being threatened."  This is exactly what I was going for in TRNC, regaining of hope.  Hope is actually a mechanic in the game. <br/>\nThe parts of the rpgnet thread are familiar. I've had similar ones. It is neat that others are thinking some of the same ideas.  It kind of lends credance(?) to my ideas.<br/>\nI'm really interested in seeing how this comes together.

I'm interested in helpful suggestions for embellishments, but not a lot of arm theorizing over what may or may not work in play. I'll find out about that myself, when I actually play.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Always roll your Clarity and Fear dice.<br/><br/>Once per roll, you may increase your Fear by 1.<br/><br/>Any time you roll, you may add any or all of your available Wyrd dice.<br/><br/>To determine success, count all the 1s, 2s, and 3s. Compare to the GM's Pain roll.<br/><br/>To determine dominance, find the color with the highest result (including the GM's Pain roll).<br/><br/>Clarity<br/>This stat represents your reason, cleverness, and your grasp on the real world. You always start with 3 Clarity, but this will go up and down frequently. Each increase in Clarity reduces your available Wyrd dice by 1, and vice versa.<br/><br/>When it Dominates: Things stay under control, even if you fail. Shift 1 point from Wyrd to Clarity and you may choose to decrease your Fear by 1.<br/><br/>When it hits 6: You lose the ability to enter the Hedge, use your Seeming, or invoke your Contracts. You're a normal, helpless person until someone drags you into the Hedge and makes you spend time getting shredded by the thorns.<br/><br/>Wyrd<br/>This stat represents your attunement to the Hedge and Faerie; it fuels your magic. You always start with 3 available Wyrd dice, but this will go up and down frequently. Every increase in Wyrd reduces your Clarity by 1, and vice versa.<br/><br/>When it Dominates: Magic happens. Outside the Hedge, your Seeming becomes visible. Inside the Hedge... things may be attracted to your location. Shift 1 point from Clarity to Wyrd.<br/><br/>When it hits 6: You lose the ability to leave the Hedge. Unless someone can bring you back to your senses (any successful roll where Clarity dominates; Pain = 6), you'll turn into a hobgoblin.<br/><br/>Fear<br/>This stat represents the one, overarching commonality of every Changeling's existence. You start the game with 1 Fear, but it will increase rapidly.<br/><br/>When it Dominates: Things get out of control, even if you succeed. Your response must be either Fight or Flight. Increase your Fear by 1, even if you did so before the roll.<br/><br/>When it hits 6: You go crazy. Act accordingly. You gain 1 point of permanent Fear. Note the thing that triggered the roll; any time you encounter it in the future, you must roll to maintain your self-control.<br/><br/>Pain<br/>These dice represent the strength of the opposition. They are always rolled by the GM.<br/><br/>When it Dominates: Even success comes at a price. Add a coin to the Despair bowl.<br/><br/>Contracts<br/>These are deals you've made with aspects of the World during your time in Faerie. You may "remember" them with Hope coins. (You can create new ones in-game, but it means returning to Faerie.) In any case, the exact terms of the Contract are negotiated by the player(s) and the GM. All should include a benefit, a cost for invoking, and a penalty for violation (usually that the Aspect hates you and becomes anathema to you).<br/><br/>Seemings<br/>Your supernatural aspects let you do supernatural things. Any time you use your Seeming, you must roll a minimum number of Wyrd dice based upon the magnitude of the desired effect, as determined by the GM. Mortals cannot see your Seeming... unless Wyrd dominates the roll.<br/><br/>Adrenaline<br/>Every Changeling has one mundane talent that's fuelled by their Fear. Often, it is something that aided them in their flight from Faerie. To make a minor use of this talent, your Fear must be at least 1; your current Fear total becomes the minimum number of successes for the roll. To make a major use of this talent, add 1 to your Fear pool; you may add your Fear total to whatever successes you roll.<br/><br/>Despair<br/>The GM adds a coin to the Despair bowl every time Pain dominates a roll. The GM may spend a coin from the Despair bowl to add or remove a 6 from any roll. (If this causes Pain to dominate, no new coin is added to the bowl.) Spent coins are paid into the Hope bowl.<br/><br/>Hope<br/>Players may spend a coin from the Hope bowl to shift their Clarity/Wyrd 1 point, or to reduce their Fear by 1. (Permanent Fear cannot be removed.) Players may also spend a point of Hope to establish a new fact about their past: Contracts, allies, where they hid the spare house key, etc. Spent coins are paid back into the Depair bowl.<br/><br/>Both bowls are reset to 1 coin/player at the beginning of each session.<br/><br/>--Dan<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>New idea on Wyrd: When it hits 6, the Hedge starts shaping itself in response to your will. (Note: This means it wouldn't do that most of the time in my WoD.) Nearby Hobgoblins and Fae are drawn to your location. This condition persists until the character loses a conflict to the GM (i.e. gets some sense beaten back into them).<br/><br/>This is in the interest of giving the death spirals a softer landing, but I never really liked the recovery mechanic in the original post.<br/><br/>--Dan</blockquote>\nFred comes in between these two thoughts to mention that the death spiral set up above is very quick, which might be good for our game pending on the length we want to run this.  Forlorn1 had originally wanted to contemplate a Changeling version with the pos of con usage so the dynamic may work for us.<br/><br/>I like the framing of a lot of the above but ultimately the focus isn't going to work for our specific game.  Tweaking will help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179262/#Comment_179262" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-18T23:07:00+00:00" title="November 18, 2008 11:07PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds very interesting, and I'll look forward to hearing how it turns out.

(unless, of course, both world wars were just distractions by the goblin king in order to steal children)<br/><br/>for primary locations, similar to "Back in Time for Tea" we had decided that the locations need to be very close.  So that any falling through to the Goblin Market would be quick and near.  I don't know if this means Shadow, Alley Ways, Fever, The Witching Hour or some other abstraction that is the gateway.<br/><br/>one of the things we're considering is using the mythos i created in the first post as a sub-strata and skinning that with different faces for actual play.  So, for instance, the WWI/II steal children thing that i use earlier here.  Or possibly from last night, Perhaps the children are in a TB ward and the sickness is really a way for the Goblin King to get to children; so that the kids are fighting the goblins with the help of the fae and also battling illness (the Goblin King's Doubt trying to break their will and resolve).<br/><br/>at present the Discipline / Exhaustion / Madness // Pain  dice are mapping to:<br/><br/>Curiosity / Innocence / Beguile // (Punish/Naughty/Trouble)    with Hope and Fever coins.<br/><br/>So far the mechanical mapping is the weakest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179427/#Comment_179427" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-20T07:16:21+00:00" title="November 20, 2008  7:16AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over at camp Innocence we've had a few developments overnight:<br/><br/>Rustin has come up with an alternative scenario where the DRYH team youth wants to stay asleep in fae realm.  hard to describe as anything other than Little Nemo-esque.  That's on the table.  It's not providing yet the solid reality that we're trying to pre-load into the scenario.<br/><br/>There's some discussion amongst us as to what the exact relationship between Exhaustion and Madness is thematically and mechanically.  Both lead similar paths narratively.  Is that necessary?  Can they divorce?  The reason this is important is that if we use (for example) whatever maps to Exhaustion as the pull for the magical npc (thing Tinkerbell again) then you have a scenario where Tink has to slowly enter the story and be reused in order to gain in dice pool power and become more and more effective.  Since we are basically developing a one-shot hack.  An advantage here is that when the Tink dice shoot the moon... you've either a: had her step in front of the goblin's axe and take a hit for the team, or in a varying scenario b: perhaps the children accrue some sort of "lack of wonder" where they can no longer See or Command the fae realm because of doubt or growing up or what have you.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm fighting for a mechanical change to Discipline.  We are looking at fracturing Discipline into Major and Minor chords.  This is a way to immediately add flavor to characters rather than start them all on a level field.  Fred describes "normals" as having Discipline 1 or 2 dice and pcs starting with 3 dice.  In the spirit of kid movies, where there are immediate archetypes:  the smart one; the fat one; the pretty one; the fast one; the wealthy one, i thought it might be cool for the characters to have a standard value of 2 dice with a major value of 3.  Meaning that dragging your character's leading attribute into the scene will yield an immediate mechanical benefit.  The "fat kid" could still disarm the bomb, but he'd have to use an extra Madness die to have the same level of success as the "smart kid".  Or, i suppose, he could just choose to eat it.  The major chord would be an attribute entirely up to the player's creation.  Both will fall under the category of Discipline (or what it maps to).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179629/#Comment_179629" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T06:52:20+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  6:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            friday morning notes:<br/><br/>Though, both Jeff and I like the npc fae helpers as a manifestation of either madness (beguile) or somehow mapped to the progression in exhaustion... i've haven't been able to make it work yet and some in our quorum have raised the idea of "if that's the case then why aren't we just playing the npcs".  valid.  still.  makes me sad.  for now, unless i can find a better tool on it, it will probably be shelved.<br/><br/>for our game, i'm going to rename Fight or Flight to Gumption and Guile.  It places conflict into a more positive arena for the child avatars.  One of the design goals was to keep this less psychotic and more fairy tale.  Everyone is on board with this.<br/><br/>With regard to the story craft, we are pretty evenly split between those that think the fairy world should be a place of attraction and possible inhabitance and those of us that think the kids are always trying to get home.  My argument for the latter is that it seems most children's stories inevitably find the kids tiring of the fae seduction and wanting to be with mommy and daddy.  Also, one of the design goals was towards a one-shot / con session.  keeping the alternate reality as cleanly uninhabitable streamlines things.<br/><br/>Everyone is on board with the major / minor chord idea.  John Lammers has toyed with the idea of spinning of the major into Exhaustion.  We'll be looking at that today.<br/><br/>Skinning the mechanics still consumes most of the time.  If we'd clearly defined how to skin this at the offset i don't think that this would continue to be a problem.  <br/><br/>i'll end with john's notes from the overnight session:<br/><br/>Actually, I like the gumption/guile thing quite a bit, as well as the<br/>exaggerated "major chord" from discipline.  It seems a lot closer to<br/>baseline DRYH than the fae NPC (though I still like that idea as well--maybe<br/>for Madness).<br/><br/>To summarize one permutation of all this:<br/><br/>Flight/Flight =&gt; Gumption/Guile<br/>Discipline =&gt; Discipline (maybe nuanced or clich\xe9d or aspected; e.g, "smart<br/>kid")<br/>Exhaustion =&gt; Discipline's major chord exaggerated<br/>Madness =&gt; Fae NPC help<br/>Pain =&gt; Pain<br/>Hope =&gt; Hope? Innocence? Wonder? Guardian?<br/>Despair =&gt; Despair? Fever? Delirium? Doubt?<br/>Snapping =&gt; Snapping<br/>Crashing =&gt; ?<br/><br/>Character Questions:<br/>What's been keeping you awake? =&gt; Why are you Beyond the Hedge?<br/>What just happened to you? =&gt; unchanged<br/>What's on the surface? =&gt; unchanged<br/>What lies beneath? =&gt; unchanged<br/>What's your path? =&gt; unchanged<br/><br/>Is it a given that all the characters are trying to escape?  Or is it like<br/>DRYH where they may have their own reasons for being there?  Can they travel<br/>back and forth?  In the fever scenario, are they trying to find the source<br/>of their sickness or does escaping the world Beyond the Hedge equate to<br/>beating the sickness and recovering?  Could "crashing" mean you are at<br/>death's door and pulled back into the "real" world, where doctors work to<br/>hold off the disease and you're in very real danger until you stabilize and<br/>slip back into delirium and the other world?  (I'm not sure that's a good<br/>idea, I'm just churning on how to handle the shift between worlds and its<br/>story manifestation.)  Should crashing just be ignored altogether?  I'm not<br/>sure I see how it fits or why it's even there, except to slow down your use<br/>of exhaustion talents and as a thematically all-but-unavoidable element for<br/>a game about insomniacs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179641/#Comment_179641" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-21T08:17:40+00:00" title="November 21, 2008  8:17AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If this gets tight it would make a cool supplement for DRYH.

Currently i'm expressing my two variants as such:<br/><br/>Discipline, Minor: 2 dice<br/>Discipline, Major ( ____ ): 3 dice<br/>\t*i prefer Wonder or Imagination here.  Discipline is a schooled and learned<br/>\tthing.  Doesn't seem to fit the motif.<br/><br/>Doubt (may add one die at a time, up to 6.  maps to Exhaustion)<br/>\tDoubt's Talent is an exaggeration of Discipline's major chord: (_____)<br/>\t*results for crashing are:<br/>\t* Doubt could also be Despair, Innocence...<br/><br/>Beguile (as expression of Madness)<br/>\tBeguile Talent A: some fanciful way you interact with the other realm or<br/>\t\tsome magical manifestation.<br/>\tBeguile Talent B: trying a different tack on the npc thing.  there would be <br/>\t\ta finite number of npcs... eg Tink and Pan.  Everyone in the party<br/>\t\tcan use the Beguile Talent to access the power of the npcs.  <br/>\tSnapping re Talent A: you somehow become blind to the Hedge or the <br/>\t\tfae realm where your doubt causes you to become too cynical <br/>\t\tto access the power.<br/>\tSnapping re Talent B: with finite group magical help, eg Pan/Tink.  If any <br/>\t\tcharacter snaps their Beguile it causes the group to lose an npc<br/>\t\tpermanently.  Expressed as npc death.  Mechanically, the <br/>\t\tcharacter is unaffected but the party suffers for the rest of<br/>\t\ttournament play.  This has a benefit to knitting the group together<br/>\t\tto save the resource.<br/><br/>Pain.  sounds too severe for our motif: i'd skin with: Punish, Naughty, or Trouble.  Mechanically, Pain continues to operate as original.<br/><br/>Scars map to Wishes.

A push and pull is good.  The chargen was done in the round and as such people loaded traits from one char into the next to help build synergy.  our design goal again is for short form play so all the characters need to be tight knit from the get go.<br/><br/>curiosity works as a better frame than discipline for the age range.  as such the third die is only rewarded for the child's "aspect".  Doubt (nee Exhaustion) is mapped to Curiosity in that the Doubt Trait is that Curiosity major chord taken to its extreme but plausible conclusion.  We worked up examples of these pairings and i'll list them later.  The game physics of this is the interaction with the fae realm is augmenting the child's natural inclination.  As mentioned above we may further map Curiosity and Doubt as a flex state but real play will dictate if this is necessary.<br/><br/>Beguile is a general pool for the children to call upon the fae npc/guardians that are helping them through the story.  There will be no Beguile talent (an error on my part for the present char sheet).  All the children for now will be able to access the npcs equally.  Pulling them into the story deeper and deeper as they go.  Any one player's crashing the Beguile pool results in death or permanent removal of the npc in use at that moment (I'm somewhat notorious and fond of using the axe in the head of Peter Pan analogy.  ok, it was funny at the time.)  <br/><br/>Gumption and Guile will be the two options instead of the pool of three for Fight/Flight.  They are gentler resolutions and fit in the theme of the play we're after.  And because it's a shorter format, initially i'm setting it up as one of each.  <br/><br/>Wishes are a hack of the scar reroll mechanic.  We are going to move wishes to boxes besides the questions.  You will get 3 wishes amongst the, currently, 5 questions that you can exhaust for a reroll.  Exhaustion will allow the GM to drag in your deepest fears/expose your secret... etc.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="denied:ftp://etagelarsenc:25750tage@ftp.etagelarsen.com:21//htdocs/nerdnyc/DLYIredcharsheetv1.png"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="denied:ftp://etagelarsenc:25750tage@ftp.etagelarsen.com:21//htdocs/nerdnyc/DLYIgreencharsheetv1.png"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="denied:ftp://etagelarsenc:25750tage@ftp.etagelarsen.com:21//htdocs/nerdnyc/DLYIbluecharsheetv1.png"/><br/><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>because we are sticking with the npc as the element of madness that the players have as their defense and offense in the fae realm and at home we're gong to have to create some mechanics for what i'm calling a Faerie Burner.  Players are going to pre-create the help that will manifest in the story.  This will put some burden on the GM to not be able to pre-progam the play as well but we'll also do some minor pre-burn of a minor villain that will help to get things started.  <br/><br/>For example: in our run through tonight.  We generated a long list of possible npcs to help us on our way.  We settled on: Magical Origami, which springs to life from the pages of secret tome (crashing Beguiling will force the book to exhaust its pages or otherwise be destroyed) and we wanted some animal theme too so we have chosen an army of pixie-ish moths that will help us (I've described this as Queen Luna of the moths along her nightly visit across the sky).  Our bad guy is going to be the Administrator of the orphanage that we're all from.

The 5 sheet questions on hte left  were so just so good and hit the right tone.<br/><br/>I'm still not positive that we have he Curiosity/Doubt/Beguile aspects tweaked out exactly right, but I can't put my finger on what vexing me, so I think it'll either come out in play, or I'm wrong.<br/><br/>And dang, just the concept of a Faerie Burner is awesome in a can.<br/><br/>One definite trait drift from DRYH was that Exhaustion Talent (which we map to Doubt) is non fantastic/magical.  DRYH Exhaustion talent seem almost superheroic, and a faerie tale story never has protagonists of that level in them.<br/><br/>Jeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180269/#Comment_180269" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T11:18:16+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 11:18AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A hopefully more cogent follow-up to last night's ramble to get some stuff updated and out.<br/><br/>thanks for the posivtive fb, Jeff.  I thought the jam session went pretty well.  if for no other reason than to drag everyone onto the same page.  i probably should reread the hacks at the top of the page in reference to how we've divvied things up and see how it sits today.<br/><br/>re Faerie Burning.  At present we're mapping one npc to every two players.  an npc can be an army of moths or it can be an animated rocking horse (family dog, Peter Pan, Puff the Magic Dragon, etc.)  The reason for this is that none of the players get particularly precious about ownership of the interaction in the narrative.  It also, hopefully creates a group-think about protecting each others Beguile (Madness) levels to not exhaust them.  There's some talk that Faerie Burning will include some sort of Aspect tree that will also help define the npcs to the players and the gm.  The Aspect tree will be a later concern.<br/><br/>trying to figure out the relationship between Curiosity and Doubt is still our most vexing.  Mechanically, Curiosity has its major chord which is the narrative lead for the player to drag in the extra (3rd) die.  the Doubt trait is then a nearly super-state of this major chord as justified by some taint of the Fae realm.  Closer to the magic exaggerates the character's natural ability etc.<br/><br/>the Elizabeth character is the only one that is successfully mapped on the above character sheet.  Her major Curiosity chord is Mannered. Her Doubt trait is Defining.  The way this is envisioned for play is that she'll get an extra die for being prim and proper and correct.  As game play ensues and she's being chased or confronted with problems the Defining trait will be brought in so that Elizabeth no longer reiterates etiquette but sort of dictates it.  It's not been played yet but i imagine this manifesting as: Elizabeth wants to drag in a bunch of Doubt dice into play as the party is being pursued by the goblin horde.  If she wins she's able to Define something in our favor... so, perhaps the Goblin horde always marches with their shoes untied and ranks of them end up tripping into each other as the children (or Elizabeth) make their escape.<br/><br/>The interrelationship of these two traits is key to character set up.  Some examples so far:<br/><br/>intuitive to clairvoyant<br/>smart to brainiac<br/>observant to photographic memory (perhaps all-seeing)<br/>pickpocket to master thief <br/>loyal to self sacrificing<br/>cruel to evil genius<br/>charming to glamour/beloved<br/>charming to inner glow<br/>sneaky to invisible (unseen)<br/>daring to swashbuckling<br/>mannered to defining<br/><br/>generating more of these is going to help us significantly box in how play develops.  would love to hear if anyone else has some thoughts on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180537/#Comment_180537" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T17:28:53+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  5:28PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2008 6:21PM by Double King.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way i've set this up... much of the play seems to hang on the notion of the npcs being used to dig you out of the Trouble the the GM gets you into.  So the issue at hand, and one i'm still really trying to brainstorm a solution for is:<br/><br/>Faerie Burning<br/><br/>in my head, it makes sense to preload the fae with abilities.  perhaps not tie them to the aspects but to help keep the npc agenda intact.  i'm not sure if fate is valid.  that could be its own mechanical thing - like a grenade.  also re aspects, i'm curious if the aspects get mapped to dice as they do in FATE.  Below are the two npcs we've created for our opening game:<br/><br/>Take for instance, fictional Luna queen of Moths: Appearance would be a gentle grey lady of delicate features and soft heather brown eyes.  She appears as an adult sized human woman.  Luna may disperse to a cloud of thousands of moths.  Aspect 1: Create Moonlight; Aspect 2: Fog of Moths; Aspect 3...dunno yet.<br/><br/>Or, for instance, the "Arcane Manual of Mathematics, Transmogrification and Animus" has the appearance of a diary sized leather volume with a gold key locking it.  The key is attached to a bookmark which is inscribed as follows: <br/><br/>"Here to help you find your place: <br/>be it sight or sound or heard. <br/>This tome to protect the human race; <br/>with the bent and folded 1000th word."<br/><br/>(ok, not my shining moment for couplets but whatever)<br/><br/>The manual Aspect 1: Able to read other books; 2: Origami animals to ... act like animals.  3: Origami army.<br/><br/>a rough draft of the way the FB document will look:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="denied:ftp://etagelarsenc:25750tage@ftp.etagelarsen.com:21//htdocs/nerdnyc/faerieburnerCharSheet.png"/><br/><br/>edit: Bond and Disposition are late additions to the FB.  Bond perhaps being the most important it will create the hook of the beguiler to the child.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182251/#Comment_182251" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T19:33:15+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  7:33PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            forlorn1 and i had a good conversation about where next to go with all of this tonight.  some further movement away from the mother game is in store...<br/><br/>our Beguile trait (nee Madness) will now become a group trait.  Again, con play.  With this volatile pool now a communal property there should be faster and more group oriented pull of the Fae into the narrative.<br/><br/>we're going to work out some pacing mechanics to create, as Jeff likes to call it, a Bell Curve for the story shape.  Where in DRYH the GM uses despair coins vs the hope coins we are going to have a static pool of Beguile dice that the players can call on.  As the GM spends his Trouble dice / despair coins the players will gain in their Beguile dice pool.  As this is a limited resource, the questions that we are mapping to Wishes (nee Scars) will now also double for either burning them to reroll or to allow for more Beguile dice.  The expense will force the character to narrate the question into the situation to some extent.<br/><br/>I'm playing with the idea of Chapters in the rounds.  This will help control the Trouble dice for the GM.  Introductory Narration will rotate to the character to the left who will block the initial scene.  The Chapter will be loaded with an some narrative expectation set off by the GM.  An example would be "Red must get to Grandma's house with wolf."  And the player could start anywhere but all would have to work generally towards the Chapter goal.<br/><br/>there's been a little talk of making the Fae aspects one-shot usage.  not sure if that'll hold.<br/><br/>Finally, We're wondering about endgame.  Is it always win-win? if not then how?  The dice loading between Trouble dice and the group Beguile pool should help us build the tension towards the player character but this clearly needs better development.  Some talk of a Roanoke type multiple victory conditions if x is fulfilled or x+1, etc. is on the table.  Also an option that your "final" wish might be some auto-lose burn situation like the last trait in 316 where in this case you need to narrate the loss of your character's goal.  this is messy.<br/><br/>With the Beguile pool now in the group domain, I am addressing the pacing of the Fae npcs.  Children's book stories usually introduce the fantastic systematically.  We may decide to have a troupe of npcs in the middle of the table that can be called on from chapter to chapter pending on whether the Beguile pool dominates.<br/><br/>the hunt goes on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188511/#Comment_188511" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T13:45:01+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  1:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2009 1:51PM by Double King.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the holidays slowed us down a few weeks but Jeff, Joanna and I sat down and made some characters; some faeries; and a whole lot of fun in a very short period of time.  <br/><br/>we're beginning to unravel some actual play.  our demo on Monday consisted of a classic Pre-industrial setting of Hans and Amelia in the forest, encountering the Frog Prince, and some conflict that was presented by a literate sprite and the darkness of the forest.  the system has some good legs.<br/><br/>i proposed chaptering the play as a way to detente an automatically escalating pool of Beguile dice.
