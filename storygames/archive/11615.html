Remember that a lot of these games (like all artistic works in any era) adopt and incrementally "push" previous developments while adding their own, so they may not be absolutely unique in every way, but they did advance the story gaming hobby.  I'm listing the "great settings" separately unless they had something unique about the rest of the game, because great settings (though I do think that they help make great story gaming and have certainly advanced the story gaming hobby) are a bit of a "different thing" insofar as "have a great setting!" isn't much of an innovation on its own.<br/><br/>1990: Nightlife. This was the first game which had both a modern setting and the players played monsters (werewolves, vampires, ghosts). This opened up a wide variety of games, including the 1991 breakout hit Vampire.<br/><br/>Nexus, the Infinite City. Again, this was a precursor to the action-movie Feng Shui that used the conceit of, well, an infinite city as a fantastical setting. This is the first game I know of to focus on urban fantasy of any kind.<br/><br/>Torg.  This was the first crossover game to actually attempt to reify genre conventions into actual game rules - which would then change as the characters went to different areas. When you were in the "horror" realm, things were a lot different, mechanically, from when you were in the "pulp adventure" realm. <br/><br/>Great Settings: Battlelords of the 23rd Century (combining "Imperial sf" like Traveller with a much less humanocentric galaxy), Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (actually very little was done with "retro adventure" for many years after this, for no reason I've particularly been able to identify), and probably the biggest and longest-lasting success of 1990, Rifts, a setting so fucking insane that people still like it and can talk about it 20 years later.<br/><br/>1991: Vampire. This one I did a whole thread about it about how great it was for story gaming. I would say the two huge innovations of Vampire were the discussion and use of themes as an organizing principle for your story and the use of the Humanity system to reflect the romance-horror purple prose of the Anne Rice novels that were its clear inspiration.<br/><br/>Amber Diceless Roleplaying.  What can be said about this game except that it popularized diceless roleplaying and had a robust player-vs-player auction character creation system that has never been equalled in its passive-aggressive methods of putting characters at each others throats and backing each other's plays <i>before they even exist</i>.  Not to mention it was a brilliant adaptation of novels that actually made me like the novels a lot more than I did.  So much of story gaming can be traced back to here and Vampire that 1991 has to be held up as a banner year for innovation in story gaming.<br/><br/>Dark Conspiracy.  I mention this one here rather than in the "cool setting" section because of the perhaps unintended consequence of the demonground rules. Basically this was a fight-monstars horror game, and when monsters took over an area, it would slowly turn into a tainted demonground and a big part of the game was securing it.  This turned the game into an alternating rhythm of pacing: First we find and kill the monsters, then in the next chapter, we hold the area and keep the evil out until the demonground is cleansed (and we've healed our wounds from the first chapter.)  Repeat.  This set a very nice pace.<br/><br/>Kult: This was the first (Swedish) edition, but eventually the game would open up new areas of horror that games had not addressed before, specifically Gnostic horror, far different from Lovecraftian or Ricean or other sorts of horror that were well supported.<br/><br/>Lost Souls: Now, maybe I'm remembering wrong, but I think Lost Souls may have been the first game which explicitly had the idea that you would play ghosts (Wraith, White Wolf's much more serious version of the concept, would not come out until 1994, though it too would bring something new to gaming - see below).  This allowed ghost stories with sympathetic ghosts to be supported via play, something that had existed for a long time.  I believe one of the adventure hooks was basically A Christmas Carol except from the point of view of three spirits trying to save the virtue of a crotchety old bastard.  How can you pass that, plus a sense of humor, up?<br/><br/>Nephilim: I always hear about how innovative this game was, but I don't know a lot about it, maybe someone can school me?<br/><br/>Timelord: The first attempt to model the popular Dr. Who television show...I'm not going to go on a lot about it because I don't think it really did much in the way of getting Dr. Who-ness across. I guess I'm including it primarily because it exposed a lot of problems with adaptations of Dr. Who and similar materials rather than solved them.<br/><br/>Great settings include: Reich Star (an alternate history game in which the Nazis won WWII and expanded into the stars and you had to go punch space Nazis).  <br/><br/>1992:<br/><br/>When Gravity Fails: This sourcebook for Cyberpunk 2020 was one of the very best of the adaptations of a "literary" cyberpunk book into a setting that had its own overarching conflicts, very different from the base game. (The base game had inspired an earlier, very different, lower-tech cyberpunk setting in Hard Wired in 1989).  <br/><br/>Dream Park: Again, a Cyberpunk adaptation that had many innovations before its time.  In it, the characters are employees who play roles inside the Dream Park as well as try to solve the out-of-Dream problems associated with the Park.  Extremely notable for being one of the most significant adaptations of a "play within a play" technique.<br/><br/>Over The Edge: This brilliant design stripped the system down to as minimum as it could possibly be while still giving guidance to the fiction and built a setting so evocative and weird that despite the virtual complete lack of any kind of balance or even interest in the game mechanics, it drew people in and got across its fictional reality very thoroughly.  As playable literary surrealism, it may still have no equal.<br/><br/>1993:<br/><br/>Bram Stoker's Dracula: This contained one of the earliest (to my knowledge) detailed investigation systems, including the accumulation of "Clue Points" which had to be accrued by questioning witnesses, obtaining and interpreting physical evidence, and so on.  It was marred by a ridiculously overcomplex combat system.<br/><br/>Cybergeneration: This was one of the first sf games that I know of to pursue an anime feel and explicitly incorporate anime elements (young protagonists, potentially damaging superpowers, colored hair and so on), throwing open the floodgates.<br/><br/>HOL: Okay, maybe this one doesn't belong on the list at all. Or maybe it's the best one on the list. It all depends on how much you like being sneered at and think something completely deconstructive of gaming can contribute to it. I know I lolled.<br/><br/>Prime Directive: Some craziness with licensing allowed a door to be opened for Trek-based story gaming.  Within the constraints of what they had to work with in their license (which is instrucive in and of itself), they pushed the envelope as much as they could.<br/><br/>Theatrix: The first game I know of to explicitly lay out procedures for getting players through "plot chokepoints" in a constructive and fun way.  The first game I know of to explicitly incorporate player statements of fact into a game with a GM.  There are probably a dozen more story game innovations in this game that are just being rediscovered.<br/><br/>Underground: As far as I know, this was the first game in which a character struggling to change a corrupt world actually has something mechanical to implement to demonstrate their struggle and its effects.  It was a weird place to discover a political system of that robustness, but looking at the action orientation of most stories in RPGs up to that point, it makes great sense.<br/><br/>Great settings: Earthdawn (I think this one had some story system developments too, can someone who knows more about it than me address that?), Whispering Vault, Traveller: The New Era (shut up, I liked it), SLA Industries...<br/><br/>1994: Castle Falkenstein. This one is right at the top of the list because of its playing-card-hand and diary-based mechanics, which brought the Victorianness of the setting out in a way that the dwarves and steam cannons might not.<br/><br/>Psychosis.  I believe this was the first game to implement a system in which the player is determining how much of what the character perceives is real and how much is insanity or delusion, explicitly making unreliable character action and narrator feedback part of the story.<br/><br/>Shattered Dreams.  This underrated game had an interesting night/day pacing cycle - the characters, who could enter into people's dreams, would spend half the game as powerful psychics and the other half as vulnerable awake people.  The monsters would hollow out people's dreams, occupy them, and then come after the characters when they were awake and didn't have their dreamshaping powers.  I'm not sure if this intentionally was a pacing mechanic in the sense that they said "wow, we have our hands on a really dramatically interesting pacing thing here", but in play, it absolutely did that.<br/><br/>Wraith: The Oblivion: Notable for the inclusion of the Shadowguide, a second player for the character.  Your character was not just your own - the "dark side" of your ghostly character would be played by another player at the table, trying to tempt you with free dice in dangerous situations.  This is the first game I know of where more than one player played each protagonist character, pulling them in different, dramatically interesting situations.<br/><br/>Nexus: Live Action Roleplaying: I believe this was the first ready-made LARP packet, with up to 44 players and 5 GMs, complete with handouts, sheets, and so on.  It was amusingly self-referential in that the events of the LARP take place during alien first contact at a science fiction convention.  But the main innovation was that this was one thing you could buy and you could get some decent acting going.<br/><br/>Great Settings: I seem to remember Periphery as having a great setting...I do have to say something about the ballsiness of Street Fighter here.  Not so much as a video game adaptation (though I think this was the first explicitly video game adaptation done), but because it took source material that actually had hit points in it and turned it into a RPG that did not.  This move has never made any sense to me ever and nobody will ever make it make sense to me. Innovation or just insanity? You make the call.  Anyway, other cool settings included Bloodshadows (To Cast A Deadly Spell, lol), and Immortal: The Invisible War (just bizarre).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259031/#Comment_259031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T21:51:59+00:00" title="February 27, 2010  9:51PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1995: Changeling: The Dreaming. I include this primarily because by 1995, urban fantasy in some version of the "real" world had become much more prevalent in fiction, and bringing that into focus in a game proved very helpful.  The previous urban fantasy games that I'm aware of had focused more on cities that were imaginary versus cities we could recognize and even use the "tone" of.  So this is more of an incremental innovation.<br/><br/>Everway: With a diceless system of various sorts of image-heavy cards, this is perhaps the only system ever published in which the emotions excited by art and concepts are the primary adjudicator of what happens rather than numbers and mathematics.  Highly notable for its innovative, emotional approach.<br/><br/>FUDGE: More even than GURPS, the FUDGE manual has always been an excellent "how to make your own campaign" kit, not just by providing options, but by providing excellent advice on how to put the options together.  Plenty of good generic systems preceded it (and of course FUDGE was alive long before 1995), so let's call this one an incremental and summary piece of progress rather than an innovation.<br/><br/>Great Settings: Nightbane, Murphy's World (super lol), Rapture: The Second Coming (biblical drama taken quite seriously), and notable adaptations included Project A-Ko (lol, megadamage rules!), Necroscope (what the fuck?), Tank Girl (SUPER what the fuck?) and Species (SUPER MEGA what the fuck?)  In 2 out of the 3 adaptations, the story game outstripped the source material in dramatic and/or comedic possibility, but of course, for 2 of the 3, this was not really difficult. Let's call 1995 the Year Of Bizarre Adaptations.<br/><br/>1996: Conspiracy X: Although conspiracies have been part of gaming for a long time, at the height of conspiracy-theory fiction and TV, Conspiracy X hit exactly in the sweet spot of occult and science fictional conspiracies.  Interesting systems included conspiracy resources and trying to gauge how powerful one group would be when taking covert action against another.  I remember this one mostly because it came out exactly at the time when everywhere you looked was a cool conspiracy story, and here was an RPG to play it.<br/><br/>Deadlands; The Weird West: The only real story gaming innovation here is a minor one in the overall scope of this mega huge game, but it was a significant one.  One of the character options in the game was a "huckster", someone who figured out the occult writings in Hoyle's book of games and used playing cards to activate magic powers. Insane enough, but to activate these powers, the player actually played a brief card game with playing cards.  In other words, the system was exactly what the character was doing, or a near approximation thereof, adding a tactile feel to the minigame. Pretty crazy if you think about it.<br/><br/>Feng Shui: The first cinematic RPG to take a cinematic genre and hit the genre expectations and ideas with a hammer over and over, right on the nail, and do it explicitly and in every aspect of the mechanics. Highly innovative. There's a reason it remains top of the pile as far as action movie stuff goes, even despite...<br/><br/>Hong Kong Action Theater!: Which contained the innovation that you need to keep track not just of your character in this moment in his life, but <i>how popular the actor playing your character is</i> and traits like that.  Mind-blowingly meta, long before "meta" was an adjective. Highly worth a look, especially because unlike Feng Shui, the sourcebooks actually look at Hong Kong action subgenres in great detail.<br/><br/>Great settings: Fading Suns (I always thought it was dumb but that's just me), Heavy Gear, Witchcraft, Vampire: Dark Ages                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259034/#Comment_259034" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T22:05:32+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 10:05PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, something cool came out of an argument about Rule Zero!

I should say that it was the first one in English, now that I think about it.  Because of the huge broadness of anime, this generic-ness was needed in order to have a sufficiently broad toolbox to make a good stab at what anime was about.  Actually I started getting interested in anime after I read BESM, so it introduced me to a whole different style of storytelling and animation.<br/><br/>Control: This game, now available in PDF in an updated edition, had a unique campaign structure.  It was a conspiracy investigation-and-fighting game, and as the player characters gathered resources and took action against a conspiracy, they themselves gained influence and power until, at the end of the game, they became the conspirators - and one would become the GM for the next section of the game, which would be about the abuses of power their characters were committing and who had to be stopped.  This is the first game I know of that took a political theme/point of view about power corrupting and actually built it into the mechanics of the endpoint of a campaign right down to who GMs.<br/><br/>Everlasting: This series of games was innovative in a couple of ways. First, it included rituals that were to be conducted before and after game sessions to get everyone in the mood and into the fiction. Some were amazingly pretentious. But at the same time, when I actually did them? ...it pretty much worked 100 percent right.  Second, it took the modern fantasy/horror genre, which was getting a bit hyped after the big success of Vampire, back to more folkloric roots and went to a different literary source.<br/><br/>Legend of the 5 Rings: Someone more knowledgeable than me should certainly talk here about the different ways in which this encouraged thinking about honor and the sort of underlying fiction Wick was aiming for....<br/><br/>Great Settings: Armageddon, BLUE PLANET (in giant letters one mile high), The End (what was with bible stuff in the 90s?), Jovian Chronicles, In Nomine (I know it really came out earlier, I speak English OKAY?!), Trinity, Usagi Yojimbo (this one might actually merit inclusion in the above list rather than just down here, let me think about it some more)<br/><br/>1998: The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen: I really shouldn't have to sing the praises of this one HERE, do I? Okay, well, I guess I do. Interruption as fiction-builder, dares and competition as means of promoting good stories, fuck it, if I have to say this game is innovative to you there's no hope for you, anyone who reads this game will see it immediately.<br/><br/>Heaven and Earth: By contrast, I do have to justify this one on the list, but I'm going to do it because it aims very specifically at a ridiculously narrow fictional target and hits it dead on: small town horror/weirdness like "Twin Peaks" or "American Gothic" or "The Outer Limits".  Nobody had quite hit this target before, they had only tried to hit bigger horror/weirdness targets, or, if it needed to be more specific, gone urban.  Small towns are different, and Heaven and Earth gets that.<br/><br/>Kobolds Ate My Baby!  Fine, it's not innovative, but it boils down (haha) a lot of comedy ideas (catchphrases, grotesquery, intentional dumbness), that have been developed over hard labor on failed stages across the world into a fun game.  Comedy is so hard to do right, and for something to hit not just comedy but a particular subpart of comedy so clearly, deserves mention.<br/><br/>Tribe 8: This game tried to get itself across largely in fiction, much like Over the Edge did, but even more obliquely and even more poetically. Did it work? Maybe, maybe not. It didn't for me but others swear by it.  It definitely has to get points for trying though.<br/><br/>Star Trek: The Next Generation: Probably the most important thing for our purposes is the methods for creating and resolving problems in discrete chunks, like, say, an episodic TV show.  Maybe this one doesn't belong on the list, but I really got something out of those methods.  Maybe others did too.<br/><br/>Unknown Armies: The Madness Meter deserves mention here, for being the first real system for mental stability that was both detailed and thorough, looking at characters under different levels of stress in many situations. Brilliant both for roleplaying feedback and innovative for seeing just how bad things have gotten for the character as well.<br/><br/>Great settings include: Hercules &amp; Xena (this is the game I point to when people say they like historical RPGs but really don't give a damn about history), Star*Drive for Alternity? I donno, pretty weak year for settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259039/#Comment_259039" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T22:23:13+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 10:23PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great list and details, Jason - I'm reeling from the impact of nostalgia flashbacks.

Basically it would let players gather historical "stuff" for the setting, use it for dramatic purposes, without concerning yourself with actual accuracy.  Unlike H&amp;X, 7th Sea actually told you to do that and how.<br/><br/>Brave New World. This one is probably only of interest to me, everyone else will be like "JDC, there's one thousand prior superhero games, why are you stupidly including one and calling it innovative"?  Well, that's because I'm a comic book nerd and I identify BNW as hitting very squarely a comic book <i>subgenre</i> that was previously highly underserved, the "wah wah they hate us" subgenre.  BNW was great at picking out a comic book tone and showing you how to get there and getting the tools you needed to get there. As a comic book aficionado, I can identify these subgenres and can very much see as innovative a game that really points very directly at one experience and say "there, go there." BNW did this. It also had a mechanic that would eventually see life in Savage Worlds and Dragon Age: after announcing your intent and making your roll, your "measure of success" actually provided you with different mechanical bonuses based on how great you did.  It wasn't just "oh, you did great, let me narrate how great you are", it actually listed what would happen at various levels of success.  <br/><br/>Forgotten Futures: Unlike Space 1889 and previous Victorian-era sf and fantasy mashups, Forgotten Futures went back to the literary sources and explored in great detail what Victorian-era futurists and thinkers believed the far future would be like.  By chasing those literary sources very thoroughly, you had a game that was educational as well as compelling.  Forgotten Futures is an underrated game by many, but I know I learned a great deal from the sources it sent me looking for.<br/><br/>Nobilis: It's innovative because it's my FIRST TIME IN THE CREDITS OF AN RPG HAHA.  Well, no, not really.  This is the first game that really promoted the "small gods" type of story, which has been present in fiction for many years.  The resource management system and common creation of resources and enemies also led to a great deal of player investment in what could otherwise be a bit alien and daunting of a narrative.  The only way to make Nobilis work was to make it very personal, and the game included mechanics to do just that.  Plus there's all that flower jargon bullshit, come on, you have to love that stuff, don't you? COME ON.<br/><br/>Pokemon Jr. Adventure Game: I am not kidding here.  I am really not kidding at all.  This is a game that takes a very simple storyline that appeals to young children and presents it in a very simple way (really primarily a set of scenarios to follow along with - like their favorite shows and games) in a way that other kids games only aspire to.  This gives the kids exactly what they want in order to experience more of the stories they love.<br/><br/>Puppetland: First person narration for the win.  I can't even think of another game before this time that said "narrate in this person, and here's why".<br/><br/>Great Settings: Aberrant, Continuum (MY BRAIN), Ironclaw (fucking furries ruin everything! Ummmm...why is this so fun?), Sengoku, Vampire Hunter$, Weird War 2.<br/><br/>Basically after getting back from a great GM's conference, I am really psyched about our hobby.

Uh, your character is an immortal supernatural being dude represented by magical elements and whatnot, so there were WoD-style character classes/races. And you roll for your past lives during various occult-significant dates in history (including Montsegur 1243, actually), and then you have your current modern life, which is some person just like a CoC investigator (rules-wise). And the earth was once ruled by intelligent, magically-skilled lizards. I got rid of this game because it didn't do anything for my CoC games, but maybe I was just a dumb kid.<br/><br/>Immortal was a bit similar, actually. You are some normal person who realizes you are actually an immortal supernatural being who just went into forgetfulness at some point. Where Nephilim lets you have past lives like 5000 years ago in Egypt, Immortal lets you go back millions of years to when you were all slaves of the intelligent, magically-skilled lizards that ruled the earth. If Immortal has any innovation in it, it is this: it combined Highlander, Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, Wraith, and Changeling (yes, before Changeling even came out) together into one game! And then it went farther, because instead of just having a wolf form, your non-human form could be any animal, or an animal made of fire, or a weapon, or like, your shadow!<br/><br/>It didn't have a mechanic for generating past lives like Nephilim did, though it did suggest you play flashbacks with the same characters in earlier times, involved in the stuff in the gonzo timeline they provided.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259072/#Comment_259072" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T06:35:58+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  6:35AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>1990: Nightlife.

I remember that being fairly mind-opening for me at the time.<br/><br/>I loved this. Loved it. <br/><br/>There were a few other things about the way magic worked, especially around thread weaving, that I found useful for story-generation-fodder-stuff. (Note my advanced use of story games jargon!) <br/><br/>The way it worked, basically, was that you could gain bonuses against enemies or for friends if you could discover significant facts/items/places about them. You'd then do a little ritual and tie a magical thread to them, gaining the ability to magically pump yourself when dealing with them. This always helped push the story element of the game because it resulted in PCs investigating their enemies, finding out details about them and their lives, interacting not only with them but with the world around both of them and getting tangled up in all the other interactions. It was pretty slick, actually, but the books never really did a good job (IMO) of explaining how you could use this to make the game cook. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Tribe 8: This game tried to get itself across largely in fiction, much like Over the Edge did, but even more obliquely and even more poetically. Did it work? Maybe, maybe not. It didn't for me but others swear by it. It definitely has to get points for trying though</blockquote>\nThe other thing about Tribe 8 was that it represented an extreme point in the metaplot dance that worked its way through 90s games. Much as the fiction vs fact issue was something a lot of people focused on about the game, from my POV it wasn't what ended up hurting the game in the long term. What did that was the way the metaplot was structured and clamped down on as a way to drive book sales. Which is kinda sad, as one of the things that drew me to the game in the first place is that one of the first pages in the book told you, as a player or GM, what the game was about and what was going to happen. You started off everything with a prophecy that told you the stages the game was going to go through, as well as an explicit theme (blood and sacrifice) -- and then instantly got plunged back into the dark to follow a trail of breadcrumbs. <br/><br/>Also, clearly one of the most important things Tribe 8 did was to set the game in Canada. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Cybergeneration: This was one of the first sf games that I know of to pursue an anime feel and explicitly incorporate anime elements (young protagonists, potentially damaging superpowers, colored hair and so on), throwing open the floodgates.</blockquote>\nThe other thing I always loved about Cybergeneration was that it was the first game I encountered that had character creation through play at the table. You'd sit down for the first time to play and get kicked into the fiction immediately, as a group of kids on the run from the cops huddled around a computer trying to find out information about why your life had gone to shit. Within 10 minutes you're making your characters as you go, getting introduced to the rules a set at a time (first you have some basic skill checks, then a chase, then a fight, and so on) and getting a taste of the bizzare animeness of the world all at once. As a fast in game its got few competitors. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Feng Shui: The first cinematic RPG to take a cinematic genre and hit the genre expectations and ideas with a hammer over and over, right on the nail, and do it explicitly and in every aspect of the mechanics. Highly innovative. </blockquote>\nAlso an early leader in the "players do over-the-top stunts that explicitly give benefits for description, and implicitly temporarily give them directorial powers" field. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Theatrix: The first game I know of to explicitly lay out procedures for getting players through "plot chokepoints" in a constructive and fun way. The first game I know of to explicitly incorporate player statements of fact into a game with a GM. There are probably a dozen more story game innovations in this game that are just being rediscovered.</blockquote>\nOn reading Heroquest 2nd edition I was amazed by how much of the game was like Theatrix with the dice added back in. Though, and I know this may bring the HeroQuest fan's ire down upon me, I think Theatrix did the "conflict logic flow" better than HQ2. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Unknown Armies: The Madness Meter deserves mention here, for being the first real system for mental stability that was both detailed and thorough, looking at characters under different levels of stress in many situations. Brilliant both for roleplaying feedback and innovative for seeing just how bad things have gotten for the character as well.</blockquote>\nIt also combined this with character motivations and fears (called Stimuli, I believe) that had mechanical weight. When you acted in accordance with your impulses (noble, fear, rage) you could reroll dice to get better results. However, some of them carried weight for using them to gain the reroll -- using your fear impulse, for example, would force you to do a check against the madness meter. <br/><br/>Also, player defined skills and (in the second edition) explicit character group and theme creation as a rules-mandated part of play. And let us not forget some of the brilliant con-game one-shots the game produced: Jail Break being a classic worth looking at even today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259115/#Comment_259115" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T11:38:31+00:00" title="February 28, 2010 11:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>You started off everything with a prophecy that told you the stages the game was going to go through, as well as an explicit theme (blood and sacrifice) -- and then instantly got plunged back into the dark to follow a trail of breadcrumbs.</blockquote>\nI remember that now!

It was "sold" as shareware, i.e., if a person liked it, they could send me $5 through the post.<br/><br/>1998-2001: a PDF available for $10 using an on-line credit-card service. Sorcerer &amp; Sword and The Sorcerer's Soul were also made available during this period in the same form. The Apprentice was written in 1999 as a promotional device; its content matches this version of Sorcerer but is considerably limited and organized as if for a convention game, with less choices.<br/><br/>2001: Sorcerer was upgraded and released as a book. The two supplements were also upgraded and published as books in the next year or two, and a third , Sex &amp; Sorcery, was written and published in book form only in 2003.<br/><br/>For some reason, possibly the Wiki entry, the Apprentice has received a great deal of attention in the past couple of years. This is unfortunate because the rules are (a) obsolete, (b) a bit of a failed experiment relative to the overall game, and (c) limited in a way which does not match any version of the overall game. I think a number of people may believe they have or know Sorcerer based on reading it, despite my constant statements that it's an artifact.<br/><br/>Also, you mentioned the PDF supplements, which makes me a little nervous. Neither of them are current; major rules changes and conceptual content were incorporated for the book versions.</blockquote>\nAbout this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: efindel</cite>The system supposedly started out as "Maelstrom" in 1996, but I don't know how much of that was in Maelstrom.

My three big revelations of the early 90s --<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I encountered GURPS.  Yes, technically, it's from the mid-80s.  The revelation was that you could use mechanics, and tune mechanics, to support what you wanted to do in a game.  You want personality mechanics?  Mental disadvantages.  You want detail in places other than combat?  Skills.  It was also revelatory to have what amounted to a single mechanic governing everything: 3d6, roll below a target number.  These don't seem innovative to me now, but I came from a background of games with a lot of ad hoc rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I encountered Vampire, which tried to make social interaction as important as physical interaction, and which demonstrated that you could have a successful game that did not focus on combat.   And beyond any game innovation, it lured a whole different demographic into role-playing games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, I encountered FUDGE, and specifically the idea that detailed rules got in the way as much as they helped -- that it was actually preferable for the GM to make a judgment call to keep the game running, that getting it close enough was good enough, than it was to stop the game to look up the rule.  This, again, doesn't seem innovative to me anymore, but at the time it changed my world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259264/#Comment_259264" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T09:03:56+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  9:03AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for accuracy's sake, Timelord was actually the second attempt at making a Doctor Who roleplaying game.

TFOS didn't advertise it's anime-ness as much, but it and Mekton were nonetheless the first anime-inspired RPGs, at least in the English-speaking world, and beat BESM to the punch by more than a decade. BESM is definitely the more <i>influential</i> game, but that's separate from being innovative.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I thought about Project A-Ko, but I am pretty sure that Robotech was the first licensed anime game, back in 1986. So definitely cool but not innovative.</blockquote>\nFunnily enough I didn't think of Robotech (even though it was the first RPG I ever played!) because it wasn't presented as an anime per se (the amount of artwork actually taken from the anime--and the only portion of the artwork that was actually anime-style--was trivial), and because the Project A-ko RPG was an order of magnitude better at actually portraying the source material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259323/#Comment_259323" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T12:10:16+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 12:10PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>TFOS didn't advertise it's anime-ness as much, but it and Mekton were nonetheless the first anime-inspired RPGs, at least in the English-speaking world, and beat BESM to the punch by more than a decade.</blockquote>\nOh, no, the innovation of BESM was definitely the <i>genericness</i> of the approach to anime.

Basically, it came down to the fact that if your character had "X strength", you could determine by that number alone how far he could throw an item weighing X (far), and how far he could throw a heavier item weighing Y (not as far), etc. There was a little of this in DC Heroes before it, but the integrated-ness of it in TORG blew my mind.<br/><br/>It was an evolutionary dead end, though: I don't know any game that carried it forward. Thank god, too; it had absolutely fuck-all to do with telling a cool heroic inter-planar action story.<br/><br/>* A detailed fantasy magical system and correlating chart where, given enough time and skill (by this I mean "character's magical ability"), you could create any game effect you wanted in conjunction with the aforementioned physics engine straight by the rules (and some die rolls). I remember creating a spell that would cause plants within 200 feet to glow with light for like 10 minutes, and it was a pretty daunting spell.<br/>Like, today, if you were to couple a software program with the Aysle magic system, I bet it would look like VISIO on crack.<br/><br/>========<br/>(back to thread)<br/><br/>Legend of the Five Rings: Its rules were innovative in that there were 4 "uberstats" (Air, Earth Fire and Water), and each of these were made up of BOTH a physical attribute AND a mental/social attribute. So it was impossible to create a typical Awesome Action RPG Guy who was all high dexterity and strength and low everything else. <br/>However, Honor and Glory and stuff were straight-jackety and kinda shallow: The rest of it I'd put in the bin of "Great Setting" (because it was; very interesting, lots of conflict bubbling in all directions).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259420/#Comment_259420" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T17:09:24+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:09PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>You started off everything with a prophecy that told you the stages the game was going to go through, as well as an explicit theme (blood and sacrifice) -- and then instantly got plunged back into the dark to follow a trail of breadcrumbs,</blockquote>\nUmmm wow.  Tripe 8 is one of those games I kind of missed during the late 90s.  Brand, can you tell me a little bit more about this?<br/><br/>So the Tribe 8 1st ed book starts off with the Prophecy of Joshua. Its this cool little bit of over the top 90s goth-angst prose that's a recording of the dying words of Joshua, who is more or less the betrayed God of Rage. The prophecy is the thing that the group the PCs are part of (the Fallen) use as their reason for being, as it tells that the Tribes (who kicked them to the curb, thus making them fallen) are full of wicked shit and are going to have to be purged before the world gets fixed from its current gnostically-fucked state. <br/><br/>The nifty thing about the prophecy is that it laid out the metaplot, if you had the magic codex that let you read it. The problem is the magic codex was never published. (Or not until years later, in the 2nd edition, which was pretty much the dying book of the line.) So you have this nifty prophecy that you could, conceivably, have used as a template for play, something for players and GMs to work together towards creating through play, but instead you got a tease about where the game was going to go that didn't actually help you get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259430/#Comment_259430" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T17:41:18+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:41PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2010 5:44PM by Tanya Fyans.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, my thoughts based purely on my trip through the '90s.

Talsorian was as a game company. I was very fond of Cyberpunk's lifepath system and its Friday Night Fire Fight insistance that combats be quick rather than short.<br/><br/>Also, TFOS rocked my world (and I didn't even know what anime was at the time.) For me, it was one of the first systems with character-created statistics (you had a handful of points for "knacks" which were a type of trait that applied however you described the knack itself.)<br/><br/>I'd also like to point out how wowed I was by FUDGE, in that it divorced rules from setting even more effectively (for me, at least) than GURPS and allowed me to really see how little (or how much) effect changing the numbers could have on a setting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Fyans</cite><br/><br/><b>The World of Darkness:</b>Totally changed the LRP scene. Humanity was cool. Shadowplay. Shame about the rest of the baggage.<br/></blockquote>\nYou know, Night Life had a humanity trait first, if we're comparing origins. It even had a cool Clockwork Orange-esque term for "looking less like a monster because you've been acting less like a monster." <br/>They called it being "in the pink."<br/><br/>(Now that my play style has been influenced by games like Polaris, Bliss Stage and Unknown Armies, I wonder how far I'd try to push that trait down now-a-days...)\n<blockquote><br/><b>SLA Industries:</b>Thinking on it, SLA was innovative for me because it threw me a curve ball. While it looked to be about big guns and cool missions, it was really about control. It also looks so awesome, and was reference-tastic.<br/></blockquote>\nThat SLA was a very rules-crunchy game, as I recall.\n<blockquote><br/><b>In Nomine:</b>While the rest of the game didn't break too much ground for me, the concept seed that was planted by the D666 was huge.

They had these favor-trading rules which really encouraged you to do as many dirty deals as you could.

To my mind:<br/><br/>It went very much from its Treasure Trap-esqu roots, was 'assailed' by the WoD, ideas of airsoft/paintball/lasertag proto-LARPs came in, with all the different play styles emerging in the '90s then it is in the 2000's where we really get games that are fusing the play-styles more and more, and where the REf/Player bounderies at some LARPs start to blur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
