Makes total sense, and I think it\u2019s usually an aspect of RPGs that I enjoyed in the past. So, stupid question, outside of adventures crafted for solo play, like the Tunnels &amp; Trolls or Fighting Fantasy kind, can one truly \u201cchallenge the player\u201d when you\u2019re playing solo? The answer would seem to be \u2018NO\u2019 in most cases as you would run into the so-called Czege Principle (<a href="http://random-average.com/TheoryTopics/CzegePrinciple" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://random-average.com/TheoryTopics/CzegePrinciple</a>). This being the case, it\u2019s probably safe to say that during solo sessions most of the challenges will be of the \u201cchallenge your character\u201d type, which would mean most of your enjoyment would probably come from watching the outcome of putting your character through such challenges; a little bit like playing God with your character perhaps. <br/><br/>However, there is a little solo game called Beloved, which shows that it is indeed possible to challenge yourself as a player: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gnPx8AlhF1TMarQ165Y1vGM382c6epUvCu1-HkXvICI/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CJDYi58F&amp;pli=1#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gnPx8AlhF1TMarQ165Y1vGM382c6epUvCu1-HkXvICI/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CJDYi58F&amp;pli=1#</a> The trick here seems to be in coming up with seemingly impossible to solve challenges (in the case of that game, an invincible monster), and then as a player, trying to figure out how the challenge is not actually impossible after all by looking for holes that you may not have been aware of when coming up with the challenge.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426655/#Comment_426655" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T08:35:07+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  8:35AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2014 8:36AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited January 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If chess legends can hone their skills by playing chess against themselves (making the best move for each side, without favoritism), I think it's certainly possible! :-D You're merely pitting your creativity against your creativity.

Perhaps they'd attempt to figure which of a set of predetermined characters or character classes is the "strongest".<br/><br/>Reminds me of the 3rd edition D&amp;D charop challenge culture, where people would set their charop skills against various sorts of intricate challenges (e.g. conquering a specific version of Hell with a character of no more than N level).

My thinking was, "If I create a puzzle or situation, I will know the answer since I'm the one creating it. Therefore, 'challenging the player' in a solo game must be impossible." But then I remembered Beloved, which manages to do something close to it. <br/>\n<blockquote>That single allowed venue - choosing your own challenges - seems entirely possible to me, though.

It's too hard to pretend you don't know something.  But to make this interesting there has to be unknown information, either through sheer system complexity (chess), because a solution hasn't been thought of (this seems to be Beloved, but I need to look into this), or because the information has yet to be created by some randomizer (e.g. Mythic GME).  <br/><br/>In the last case I think we can look to solo board games, and even co-operative board games somewhat, for guidance.  I have some experience with the "Leader" series of solo board games, specifically Thunderbolt Apache Leader, which is a mostly-strategic level game.  The resolution is pretty fast, and even more so in other games in the series, but you spend all your time planning your missions: assigning aircraft, pilots, and weapons.  This is similar to char gen exercises, except with consequences in subsequent missions in your campaign.  Cards, chips, and dice determine the specifics as they become relevant.  Frex: you have an idea but not the specifics of the opposition on a mission, similar to 1d6 orcs.  Actually, I wonder if you could just play dungeons solo, but only read rooms as you get to them.  I don't have enough experience reading them to really know.<br/><br/>An idea I've been toying with, more aiming at the board game space (specifically Mobile Frame Zero), is to have a non-real-time partner/community who writes situations with AI for you/others.

But to make this interesting there has to be unknown information, either through sheer system complexity (chess), because a solution hasn't been thought of (this seems to be Beloved, but I need to look into this), or because the information has yet to be created by some randomizer (e.g. Mythic GME). </blockquote>\nI'm arbitrarily putting the option of unknown information created by randomizer in a different bucket.

This reminds me of things like <a href="http://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/132449/nolist.pdf" rel="nofollow">NOLIST</a>, which is about using AI to experiment with creating narratives. I think I saw a kickstarter somewhere for a program that uses similar techniques to procedurally generate a mystery that the player can solve. <br/><br/>I think that I will start a thread at some point about stuff like this. I have a few AI books that I bought in the hopes of mining them for ideas that might be used as aids. For example, relationship maps are akin to graph data structures. I've mentioned before that I've used Bayesian calculations in Javascript to help me come up with odds that I feel are "realistic". <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426838/#Comment_426838" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-08T07:46:10+00:00" title="January  8, 2014  7:46AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Solo game may be like playing against the game, like board games Ghost Stories and Pandemic (all players are on the same side).

I think the mechanical principle here is related to games that use \u201cevent books\u201d like Barbarian Prince or Tales of the Arabian Nights. I also like the focus on emotional challenges in your example.

Texts of many of the games are available at the site. <br/><br/>The designers came up with many ways to get a solo player to offer challenge to themselves. Cards were a common prompt used, as in The Turning Leaves, Champion of the Realm and Joker Quest, to offer situation framing, and also as an obvious analog to simulate conflict in rp. Drawing was used in Monster Hunter X, Map of House and Beloved among others, as an activity to provide randomness or creative inspiration. What's the Frequency, Kenneth? uses google searches. And Training the Templar pits you against physical challenge as you overcome obstacles by working out. <br/><br/>To me, solo play feels like the same kind of activity as multiplayer rp, just you're not as distracted from the fact that it's a semi-spontaneous fictional generative activity since there is only one of you. The challenge provided in other rps provide both tension to the moment, so that you don't have a slack feeling of "I can do anything, so what's it all worth?" and also, simultaneously, zip together peoples contributions to the fictional events. Two-for-one. <br/><br/>The Czege Principle could be re-stated as, "if you create the fictional elements, the challenges they face and also resolve them, it may alienate others from investing in your creation since they were excluded, and also may be less satisfying to you than if you incorporated input from others, or faced some external stimuli that gave your ideas a dimension you wouldn't have thought of on your own".
