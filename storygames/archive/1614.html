                    I've posted this on my LJ, but I was hoping you guys could help me out too.
<blockquote>My creative director told me to write this essay defining viral marketing and how my agency can talk about it to our clients, but as it turns out I'm <i>presenting</i> this essay to everyone on monday. Eeek. So I'm trying to think of a way to fill up some of that time without just being a talking head, and I'm thinking a little educational game/activity to explain some key points about viral marketing would be a way to do that.<br/><br/>My first thought was some kind of variant on the old childhood game of Telephone, where you whisper a message from person to person and giggle when the message ends up being completely different than when it started.<br/><br/>A variant of this would be that some players can pass along a message to one person, but others (who represent influencers) can pass along a message to more people.<br/><br/>Dev suggested that the message could be the promotion of a color. Like, "Red is awesome." Then as the message passes from person to person, it can mutate. I dunno though.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is an activity that teaches about viral marketing like Starpower teaches about powerplays. And I need it by monday! Help!</blockquote>
I haven't had much progress unfortunately, and I'm wondering whether this is the best approach, but I want to toss it out to the best of the best before I discard the idea. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            That looks like a supa-fun game, but with 20 people it seems like it would take a while to play. And y'know, I suppose any game like telephone would be a good lesson on word-of-mouth <i>before</i> the internet allowed greater fidelity of transmission. Without the internet, you only have another person's description to go on. With the internet, you have an controlled third-party transmitter that can be referenced and experienced by whoever gets infected with the meme. Is there a way to include that aspect of it in the game or a lesson from the game?                        </div>

                            I don't know much about advertising, but it seems like the telephone game doesn't really correspond to the nature of viral marketing.<br/><br/>If I understand it correctly, viral marketing is fake-grassrooting.  It's blogs creating by marketing types, instead of actual fans.  But if done properly, it seems authentic enough.<br/><br/>Here's what I would do: I'd just ask people in the room to talk about what they like.  I'd point to people and ask them to describe the best movie they saw in 2006.  I'd ask them why.  Good acting, good plot, good special effects?  Then I'd ask what other movies they'd compare the movie to.  Then I'd ask everyone who hasn't seen it to put their hands up.  Then ask them to keep their hands up if they'd go see it, based on that testimonial.<br/><br/>The point being made: a movie web site lists only those reviews that praise the film.  It's only natural.  But some guy writing about the movie on his blog, or mentioning it in his podcast, is merely sharing his experience.  You combine that with the referential nature of most amateur movie reviews ("It was like Blade, only with monsters instead of vampires, and it was funnier"), and the average person suddenly has a frame of reference, and also the relaxation of boundaries.  I mean, some movie trailer tells you that the movie is great, well, what else are they going to say?  You can't trust them.  But some guy on his blog, telling you what he thinks -- well, you might not agree with him, but you don't question his agenda.<br/><br/>I may be way off, here, but that's probably how I'd approach it.  I'd give them a crash course in the efficacy of viral marketing by demonstrating how unpolished it appears, and how convincing it can be.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>

                            I really like Rafael's suggestion. I'm not quite sure the telephone game does what you want: the message being passed always gets mangled, which perhaps isn't what you want to convey: "Use viral marketing! It'll confuse the message!".<br/><br/>There's a few warm-up games that might work. There's the one where you give people a sheet to fill in: "Find one person whose birthday is in August. Find one person who likes foreign films." and so on. The point is that you need to talk to do it and the information spreads virally: "No, I don't like foreign films, but Jess does, go and talk to her."<br/><br/>Oh, and the one thing you might add to Rafael's suggestion is to ask how people heard about the films. You can bet no-on will say "I saw an advert": they'll say things like "A friend told me it was good".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

It's all about the group work! Use this game as a starter activity - break them up into 4 groups of 5 and get them to play for 10 minutes. Then compare results, have a chuckle, and then launch into Rafael's suggestion about discussing it. They'll be all fired up from the game and raring to discuss things!<br/><br/>Can you guess I'm currently doing a teacher training course ...                        </div>

oooo, on point, Paul!  Maybe even have somen "from paramount" do a 2 minute presentation about a film or show a trailer and see how the "plants" effected the decision making comparatively.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Also, here's a "dumb virus", as it uses social networks but not the Internet: Yesterday I received the most insidious piece of Viral Marketing in the world. I went to Taco Bell, I paid with a $20 and got change. Later in the day, I realized that one of my $1.00 bills had a website URL written clearly in pen across the bottom-right of the front of the bill. Woah.</blockquote>
Is that wheresgeorge?  Does that website still even exist?  *bops off*                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: andrew_kenrick</cite>But did it work? Did you visit the url?</blockquote>
No, interestingly enough.<br/><br/>I was so shocked when handing this dollar (which I just noticed was marked) to the lady at Taco Bell, going over and over in my head the implications of what I was holding, that I actually forgot to <i>read the URL on the dollar</i>.<br/><br/>I totally would have gone to the URl, just for shits, but I didn't even focus my eyes on it, I just saw it and went into shock, like someone seeing a train wreck then trying to remember details.<br/><br/>Weird...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Like a dumbass, I left my essay at the office. I'll post it up here on monday so you guys can download it. Basically, I broke the ice by asking, by show of hands, if anyone has seen a movie they really liked in the theater this year. Luckily, the most opinionated guy in the office had raised his hand so I asked him to describe the favorite movie he saw this year. I then asked everyone else who <i>hadn't</i> seen that movie if based on that description, they would recommend it to someone they knew. The CEO was like, "hell no!" other people were "sure" and others were just "meh, maybe." Then I said...<br/><br/>"That's viral marketing."<br/><br/>No technobabble, no BS. Just people talking to other people. I then went into a whole schpiel about how "viral" stuff isn't new. I defined viral marketing as:<br/><br/>"A controlled message passed from one person to another. The message survives as long as it is interesting enough for an influential person to notice and easy enough for them to pass along."<br/><br/>The rest of the presentation broke down a viral marketing campaign by giving it three characteristics:<br/><br/><b>Fidelity:</b> How accurately a message is passed from person to person. I used the game of telephone as an example, but didn't actually play it with the group. I described some techniques that can be used to maintain the fidelity of a campaign.<br/><br/><b>Hotness:</b> This is what makes the message noticable and memorable. I used catching a cold as an example. <br/><br/><b>Immunity:</b> This is all barriers that could make a message die, I segued this into the three characteristics of an influencer. That is, the person who will become the self-appointed champion of the message. <br/><br/><b>Exposure:</b> The influencer's media environment and all the messages they've learned to ignore. As an example, I asked the group how often they've actually investigated a car alarm going off or even thought of calling the police.<br/><br/><b>Bias:</b> Kind of a scary word, but a valuable one. These are the prejudices that grant an emotional core that can reinforce an otherwise cerebral message. The key question to ask here isn't what will make the influencer cares about (that's Hotness). The question is: what does the influencer want <i>other people</i> to care about?<br/><br/><b>Access:</b> This is whatever communication structure that the influencer prefers to use when talking to our target audience. It's not always the internet. For example, if we're targeting wealthy retirees, we should investigate country clubs and wine tastings as potential viral marketing opportunities.<br/><br/>(Yes, I gave stats to viral marketing.)<br/><br/>In closing the presentation, I tried to make all of this stuff relevant to our clients. We're in a city where street-level ambient ads aren't necessarily going to work as well as in a densely populated pedestrian environment like NYC. Our clients aren't selling burgers and movies, so Subservient Chicken and personalized Samuel L. Jackson phone calls aren't necessarily the best techniques either. I called those campaigns "water balloons." They had a broad splash and reached a lot of people all at once, but evaporated quickly. For our clients, a "laser" approach would be more suitable: Focused, well-refined and persistent in the long-term.<br/><br/>I also had illustrations and used "peanut butter and jelly" throughout the presentation as an example of a fictional viral marketing campaign.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the presentation was too good. Now I've been tapped to speak at another event, in front of strangers, later next month. Eek.                        </div>

                            Thanks so much, and thanks again to everyone here. Who knew making up stats would have applicable value in the real world? :P                        </div>
