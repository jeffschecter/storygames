Shouldn't groups be able to figure it out on their own?<br/><br/>Well, no.<br/><br/>Often when you play an indie game, you wanna play it as written the first time because the game maker have designed it the way they did to archive some effect. When a game insist that is essential that everyone should take turns reading aloud you assume the gamemaker think this is really important to the game.<br/><br/>In general it is not that essential to the game, and pushing everyone to try reading aloud, in the case when someone has real reading or speech trouble is just painful and makes the game run less smoothly.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>/Dyslectic Elin                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354273/#Comment_354273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T18:21:35+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  6:21PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elin, how do you feel about a blanket exhortation to "Think about whether any of these procedures create difficulty for anyone playing who has a disability, and adapt the rules accordingly?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you're making a good suggestion - I'm just suggesting an alternative approach that doesn't implicitly require the game designer to foresee every accessibility issue in the game, or force the designer to pick and choose accessibility issues to accommodate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354281/#Comment_354281" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T20:17:40+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  8:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya, man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354289/#Comment_354289" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T22:43:38+00:00" title="January 14, 2012 10:43PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Think about whether any of these procedures create difficulty for anyone playing ... and adapt the rules accordingly?" seems like part of the subtext of the rules to <i>any</i> story game.<br><br>Elin, I respect the point you're making, but I think you may be trying to have it both ways. If the game rules make a big deal about everyone reading out loud, then the game designer probably felt it's important to the game, and you can't just say "it's not that essential" without knowing the game. But if the game text just mentions in passing that people take turns reading, then it's probably not crucial that everyone read, and it doesn't seem like that needs to be made explicit.<br/><br/>I don't know any story games where everyone reading out loud is essential, but I can imagine that there might be some. Not every game is going to be accessible to every player, whether because of disabilities or just lack of talent. "Dread" isn't going to work well for a player with cerebral palsy; even a high-functioning autistic or Aspie would probably be stymied by "Breaking The Ice"; and I tend to avoid games with really involved combat systems because I have just enough ADD that my attention wanders during lengthy "encounters".                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354294/#Comment_354294" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T00:11:39+00:00" title="January 15, 2012 12:11AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: snej</cite>"Think about whether any of these procedures create difficulty for anyone playing ... and adapt the rules accordingly?" seems like part of the subtext of the rules to<i>any</i>story game.<br/></blockquote>\nReally?

I could add that whatever accessability issues could be <i>forseen</i> can be addressed independantly -<br/>for example, with Silver and white (which demands that each player read a section of the text aloud), the issue of one player reading aloud with more difficulty than the others - totally foreseeable.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I included the everybody-reads-aloud procedure in Silver and white to combat a different accessability issue - shyness. I theorized that if a player has already begun talking before<br/>play "starts", and if they are involved in the process of teaching the game to the the other players, then they have an in-road to involve themselves in the fiction.<br/>This aspect was mainly included for the benefit of players who are entirely new to the medium. <br/><br/>For my part, i don't mind listening as someone reads aloud more slowly than is "expected"; but if that situation makes the reader so uncomfortable that they stop having fun, well... that's not worth it. So i'll address this in the next version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354350/#Comment_354350" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T12:38:49+00:00" title="January 15, 2012 12:38PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, Shreyas: Btl?
