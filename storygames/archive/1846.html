                    From another thread:
<blockquote>I don't mean to threadcrap, and this might sound a bit hypocritical coming from me. But, Troy, do we really need to encourage more people not already thinking about making designs to make new designs? I think John Kim has taken the lead on this one, with the notion that, in fact, myriad new designs may not actually be a good thing. Maybe not everyone should be a potential game designer. The fact that such a large proportion of RPG players become game designers is, I think, a testament to the fact that there are a lot of terrible RPGs out there.<br/><br/>But there's also a lot of damn good RPGs. Just because game A is broken, doesn't mean we need game B.<br/><br/>I'm not saying we should stop making RPGs. Or even stop having design competitions and the like. But, "Hey, you there, with the cool actual play - make some rules around that!"... that's where I think you've crossed a line from RPGs as an artifact meant to be played several times, and RPG as something created to be played once, by one group, ever.<br/><br/>I think that's fine for people to create true "one shot" RPGs (that is played once, ever by one group). But I think that publishing them all could create a situation where to get the game you want to play, you'd have to pour through so many RPGs that finding the good ones might become nigh impossible.<br/><br/>I think that it's simply too much specialization. Focused design is one thing, but there is something to be said for the fact that I can sit down with a group of people and play Dogs in the Vinyard, because they've all played it before. So I don't have to teach the rules each time to everyone, and so that emergent properties of the game can, well, emerge. Which doesn't always happen if you're alwyas playing a new game each week.<br/><br/>There are loads of good ideas for RPGs in this thread. But, as I've ranted before, concepts are a dime a dozen. As Andy intimates, the good RPG is one that's been completed, and completed well, because it's been playtested, and the writers have done their homework. Let me be clear - the RPGs that come out of the Iron Game Chef competitions are crap. How could they be anything less than crap, given only a week to construct the game, and no time to playtest? The award is given to the game that sucks the least, and maybe has the greatest potential to be forged into something cool. As, for example, Jason did with Roach, or Tim with Mountain Witch.<br/><br/>Now, fortunately, this thread may not produce any designs that were not already planned - it's far easier to talk about ideas than it is to work on them. But...I dunno, let's just try to keep in mind that if you want to be a designer to try to set a very high bar for yourself. Only start a design if it's not just a cool idea, but you have a strong vision of what it might be like in the end, and you're willing to really put in the effort to make it not just an also-ran game, but one that really adds something to the constellation of RPGs that already exist.<br/><br/>I don't know if this'll slow anyone down, but I hope it at least gives them a pause to think. </blockquote>
Now, this isn't to point a flashlight at Mike: If the dogpiling starts, I'll jump out of your monitor like Tony Jaa and kick your head with the soft part of my inner forearm.*<br/><br/>What I love about recent trends in gaming and game design is that I realize that I'm of two or multiple minds about any, ANY, phenomena.  And here I both find myself violently disagreeing with Mike's pronouncements, and at the same time I find myself nodding my head hard, as if I was self-rocking at a Dream Theater concert.<br/><br/>I'll go deeper in a post or two, but I wanted to throw that out there for discussion.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Sorry about the imagery, but I just watched Ong-Bak.                </div>

                            Actually, I pretty solidly agree with Mike in every point he makes. <br/><br/>The only thing I'd say that while concepts are a dime a dozen, it often isn't easy to come up with a concept that excites you. Sometimes just that one step takes a lot of time and discussion. It's like phase 0.1 where actually start to design the game is phase 3.5. <br/><br/>So I'd say that, if anything, I'd add to Mike's warning. Not only do you need to set a high bar and make sure you have a vision of the way the idea turns out, I think a lot of game designers aren't even waiting long enough to get the exciting idea. <br/><br/>Which strikes me as one of the actual places that a lot of heartbreakers go wrong. "Just like D&amp;D but better!" isn't all that great an idea in the first place.                        </div>

<b>Agreement</b><br/><br/>* I am seeing more and more a lot of unfinished cookies being published as games. They weren't baked long (or hard) enough. They fall apart not after hours of play, but within minutes.<br/><br/>* I'm seeing a lot of folks having spontaneous crazycool ideas, and then instead of maybe creating a framework to add that effect to an existing RPG, I see people wanting to wrap it in its own design. <br/><br/>* There are a lot of games out there. A fucking ton. My best friend and I were talking once in a used bookstore: "I used to want to be a fiction writer when I was a kid. Then I realized that I didn't want to contribute to THIS." (waves arm towards a high, almost endless wall of faded paperbacks, tens of thousands of books, who knows how many were actually used/read). Sometimes when I go to the game store and see shelves of books on racks, I feel the same twinge I felt during my friend's speech.<br/>-submote: It's also hard for dedicated fans to keep up. But the counter to that is, of course, 'the cream rises to the top'.<br/><br/>* Not addressed directly by Mike, but I too feel that "the emphatic fan who writes houserules and home-supplements for his favorite game" is as important a role as "game designer", but doesn't get as much cred except in those narrow circles. Cred is suppressed until one has ones name on a book's cover. That's the reality, but it's mildly disappointing. So I think some folks (oh, but not ALL. No way. But definitely some) want to leap to "I want to design games", because that "game supporter" role seems a little empty in comparison.<br/><br/><b>Disagreement</b><br/><br/>* This world is too small and too short to not do what brings you pleasure and excitement. If you really like turning something minor into its own thing, then by God for that reason alone it's worth doing.<br/>-subnote: Also see Marx, Karl on "Praxis" as "an act of unalienated labor"<br/>-subnote: The community tends to be made up of cool, supportive folks. Wonder why scrapbooking is so popular? I believe one of the main reasons is the passionate, supportive happy community behind it. I can't even imagine a scrapbooking flamewar (but I don't doubt they exist).<br/><br/>* Half-baked ideas (if they're not, say, put on sale as Finished Works) are super-important, as they're stepping stones to lead the designer to better works.  No one is going to write their opus on their first shot (or at least, FEW are), and what better way to get there than on the backs of writing/design exercises?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: I cross-posted with Brand there.                        </div>

                            Andy, <br/><br/>I think my "even farther" fall in line with your second point of disagreement. Getting lots of half-baked ideas, and sharing them with others, is (for many) an important part of getting to that good idea. Imagine how many heartbreakers could have totally rocked if the designers had mulled over their halfbaked ideas and talked about them with others before launching into design on the first one. <br/><br/>As for your first point of disagreement, I agree with you in so much as we're sidestepping economic models of support. If we're all being Jonathan and putting our games out there for free because we design for the pure joy of it and publish to give people a chance to see our baby - that's all good. But once you start getting into a place in which we are all using the same marketing, market segment, and storefront (Forge booth, IPR, whatever) then bloat does become an issue. Because we all know there is the long tail, but I don't think some people realize how very narrow the end of that long tail is, nor how difficult it can be to be the long tail of the long tail. <br/><br/>Seriously, if it helped make a mess of d20 publishers we aren't immune to it either.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Good point on the D20 market glut, Brand.  I think that is very germain to the Indie-RPG movement.  I just wonder how many nuggets of D20 Awesomeness were out there that were missed because of the glut?  Also, I wonder when one of those cool diamond-in-the-rough D20 supplements will get seized, remastered, and turned into a ground-breaking game?<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>I think part of it is the fact that we have so many new games coming out and a community focus (sometimes) on the hot newness. <br/><br/>I remember when D&amp;D 3 came out. It took months for there to be much support avaliable online, other than just forums, because it takes time for a fan base to build up its momentum and really get into the game, figure out its workings, and toss up their own excitement and dreams in a worked out, lasting form. Then about a year later and millions of games played, there is a vast host of stuff -- possibly even too much stuff -- that you can find and use for free to support just about any type of D&amp;D game. <br/><br/>Then, as .pdf publication became more and more possible and popular, the flood gates opened and people who used to be doing free fan-support started publishing their stuff professionally rather than putting it out for free. Essentially they went from supporting the game to supporting themselves in an uneven mix. The flood of free stuff slowed down vastly, and everyone started competing to sell rather than support. <br/><br/>In our community we don't get the exact same thing, but I think we get something close to it. Which is going to earn you more respect in the community, and (possibly) more money -- supporting Mountain Witch by posting cool towns and APs, or  publishing your own game?<br/><br/>Supporting a game takes work and time. Either playing demos at cons, taking the real time and work to write up your material and make sure it doesn't suck, posting good (not crap!) APs to forums on which you may get flamed by fuckwits, and spending a lot of time playing, perfecting play, and helping others perfect play. With about the same amoung of time and energy (and minus a group of regular players, which may be more of an issue than we're often willing to admit) you can make your own game. <br/><br/>So which sounds like a better bet?                        </div>

                            Troy, <br/><br/>I think we can also help avoid doing the same thing if we work to expand our market a bit. Right now most of us are selling to all the same people, and mostly the same people the big publishers are or used to be selling too. But if we can get our PTAs onto fanfiction mailing lists, our Crime and Punishments onto the Law and Order RP lists or into stores next to "How to Host a Murder" boxes, our carrys and Spiones into book clubs and stores where people who like war and spy stories... then maybe we can avoid crushing each other. <br/><br/>But (other than Ron and maybe some others who can now come on and tell me about how I'm ignorant of their work) most of us don't seem to be either doing that or having much luck in making it work.                        </div>

                            I'll elaborate my one-off in another thread: I'd like to see a better-articulated distinction between games designed to be shared for free and games designed to be implemented as a product to be sold.<br/><br/>One of the "problems" of the recent revolutions in printing technology that makes it so damn easy to publish a book is... well, they make it so damn easy to publish a book.  The bar, once high, has been dropped <em>really</em> low, and now if you've got Word and an email account, you can publish a book.  There are no gatekeepers.  Which, sure, means that some books that might not have been published before are being published now, and we are the better for it.  However, for every one diamond, there is a hundred roughs.  As consumers we used to be able to rely on the publishing industry, composed of editors and financiers, who determined "quality" in terms of what could be expected to return the investment with profit.  The only books we saw were the result of somebody somewhere deciding to put a substantial amount of money behind them to get them out there.  And while not perfect, it was better than nothing whatsoever.<br/><br/>So as game designers, we need to become our own gatekeepers.  The decision to publish should be a real decision, considered carefully.  It requires a goodly dose of humility and to be able to ask yourself, "Is this really worth asking money for?"  There are a whole <em>boatload</em> of options besides publishing for sale, but these are not very well explored or very well recognized.  There is the free pdf download, but there is also creating games to be run at conventions (Graham's Meatloaf LARP comes to mind) and games to play with and talk about with friends online and off.  Hell, there's publishing the game through Lulu at cost.  There's also the very real category of games that can be created in order to better understand the creation of a game, to better inform the next design.  We already do this, but we have a nasty habit of then publishing them as completed games when, really, they were stepping stones to creating completed games.<br/><br/>One thing that I keep coming back to as I think about this is that a good game product has more than one awesome idea.  I've seen a lot of games -- both indie and mainstream -- that are little more than one really cool idea mixed in with a lot of material "borrowed" from other designs.  The Fantasy Heartbreaker, the "Like D&amp;D but Better," the "Sorcerer but with different dice," are all examples of this. I tend to refer to them as half-games or third-games.  They need just that little bit more oomph to make them really cool new things that I'd want to buy.  A good, solid product has multiple new, creative ideas that are themselves related to each other in new, creative ways (and are preferably implemented and presented in new, creative ways).  A good product should be a knot of new, useful ideas, rather than one new, useful idea that's tied up in a lot of old, useful ideas.<br/><br/>A quick test of this is whether or not the whole of the game can be summed up in a couple sentences.  Sure, any game can be <em>pitched</em> with a tagline, but if the tagline <em>is</em> all of the innovative content in the game, then it's not really a viable product.  If I give you money for the text transcript of what can be communicated in ten minutes of dialog, what the hell am I buying with my cash?<br/><br/>Of course, it's hard to make such a decision about one's own game.  It's especially hard if you're getting into this because you want to publish a game before you have any sense of the game you want to publish.  I'd really prefer to see our community stress game <em>designers</em> as the creative folks that people want to be and emulate, and the game <em>publishers</em> to be the addled few who decide they're going to offer their wares for actual cash.                        </div>

This is exactly what I understand Judd did for DitV, and Vincent attributes a large portion of his success to Judd's efforts.  We should pay a lot more attention and respect to these folks.                        </div>

                            The conclusions drawn in this thread baffle me.<br/><br/>Mainly this one: that fledgling designers (or designers of any pedigree) need to be the "gatekeepers" of some standard in order to protect the consumer from the horrible fate of having to choose between lots of products of varying quality.<br/><br/>Making these kinds of decisions is what consumers do. And we, as savvy 21st century people, are very, <i>very</i> good at it. How many of us read novels? Or listen to music? 99.9% of everything published or recorded is utter shit. And there are hundreds of thousands of products out there to choose from. And yet we manage to read good books and listen to good music and the sky does not in fact fall.<br/><br/>I see no crisis here in our little corner of the creative world. No alarming trend. Nothing at all.                        </div>

                            John, the consumers will be fine.  I'm talking about our community and the members of our community.  I think a little more self-induced rigor in what's worth charging cash for will produce better games in our community, and it will save some of the members of our community from putting a lot of effort into printing something that's not yet done being designed.  I'm just saying that our own brains can provide better guidance than the "gentle" hand of the marketplace.                        </div>

                            Fair points, Josh (and all); brains are good. Brainss. But a self-critical viewpoint - let's call it "The Assumption of Yawnsome" - won't be taken by all budding designers; and, wouldn't you know it, the people less likely to self-critically monitor are also those less likely to produce a solid game in the first place...<br/><br/>I still feel that Best Practise has to be implemented by more explicit community standards, that is, a culture of (other-)criticism.

                            Joshua, Brand: Of course. Publishers of games should have standards. Absolutely. Sometimes they don't hold to standards that are as high as someone else thinks they should be. Fair enough. This annoys me sometimes, too.<br/><br/>I still see no trend that requires "our" attention, and no negative consequences looming on the horizon. I'm the nay-sayer. I say nay. Nothing to worry about here. Let's go on making games like we have in the last four years or so. That would be awesome, in my opinion.                        </div>

                            John,<br/><br/>As a data point from the other side: I'm burning out.  Part of participating in the community here is keeping up with new developments.  Or so I take it.  I haven't bought any games since Gen Con.  That means I don't have SotC (for instance).  Thus it's really hard for me to participate in discussions about it.  And there are plenty of other games I'm not keeping up with.  I'm also not feeling terribly supported by the community when I think about my latest MLwM game, or an ongoing HQ campaign.<br/><br/>The community is so focused on the hot new thing, and I just can't keep up.  Now, it's possible that this is a sign that the community isn't really for me.  I'm not saying that things have to change to make me happy.  I am saying that I feel like the rapid expansion in number of games being published makes it so that I don't feel well-served by the community.  Like I said, maybe I need a new community, but I'm guessing I'm not alone here...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thanks, Thomas. It's good to hear that.<br/><br/>You're totally right about the hawt new thing getting lots of attention. That's not just us, though -- that's the way of the world. We can be sensitive to that, and try to support people who are playing the non-hawt. No arguments from me. I'm playing TSOY, Sorcerer, and Savage Worlds right now, so I can relate.<br/><br/>Blaming the game publishers for rapid expansion as the cause of this, though... that seems a little off to me. "The community" is just a bunch of people talking about what they want to talk about. If what you want to talk about isn't attracting attention, make some noise! We want to be a supportive and helpful bunch. If making noise still doesn't help, and people aren't jumping in... then, yeah. Maybe this community isn't giving you what you need. That's fair.<br/><br/>But "what this community supports and nurtures" and "what designers are publishing" are not the same thing. Related? Yes. But one is not the direct cause of the other.                        </div>

                            It's also true that as far as I know, none of the previous generation of Dirty Hippie games has yet spawned a public fan community - which is normally how games seem to make that next step if there's no Supplement Treadmill to keep them in the public eye. Where's the Mountain Witch mailing list, or the Dogs LJ community? There's Doyce Testerman's wikis, which are great, but I don't think they have a very high profile or an active community of contributors.                        </div>

                            Mark has a good point, though I think some games like The Riddle of Steel and Burning Wheel do have sizable fan communities.  Nothing quite like the In Nomine mailing list or Exalted Wiki in their primes, but I bet people could pull that off if they wanted too.  The key, though, is to make them maintain themselves without the need of constant support from the game's authors, so they don't absorb all of your time.                        </div>

Well, I for one continue to propone the idea of formal criticism.  I really should carve out some time to start righting a series of articles, maybe start a new blog for it or something.<br/><br/>But I'd also get behind mutual, bottom up criticism.  But I think we've got a certain bonhomie in place that makes that difficult.  No one wants to piss in your cheerios by telling you about their problem with their game.  I'd like to see a lot more "dude, I had this specific problem with your game" going on, but I always get the feeling that I'm sort of alone in that.                        </div>

                            I think Mike has a point, the d20 glut is a good example too, no doubt some great stuff got missed in a frenzy of not particularly well developed material.<br/><br/>I also thought the concept in that other thread very odd, if someone has a great actual play report that suggests the game they're already using is already delivering great play.  If I have a fantastic session of PTA and post a great actual play report, that's in part a testament to PTA.  It seems odd to me to think that the implication is that someone should create a new game based on that.<br/><br/>Plus, focus is good and all, but one can get I think too focussed.  If a game is designed to deliver one play experience and I've had that where do I go next with it?  More importantly, if I spent money on that and got one game from it will I buy the next focussed game?  Maybe not.<br/><br/>People do I think need to be more critical with each other, the 24 hour game contests and games in a week and all are fun but Mike's right, they're crappy games at the end of the day.  The good ones are those that have sufficient merit that with development they could become good games (which was of course the original point).  They're starting points, not end points.<br/><br/>It depends what people are designing for, if it's just for personal satisfaction and it's free on a website then no problem, but if it's for commercial release then every shitty release is potentially a barrier that could stop someone seeing the great releases, which is pretty much exactly what happened with d20.<br/><br/>Recently there was a thread here in which I saw a lot of people talking about how they had bought indie games they hadn't actually played yet.  That's partly a volume issue, designers buy each other's games and don't necessarily play them, which creates a small demand bubble.  Things aren't critical, but if the volume of releases keeps increasing that bubble could burst and I think it's already close, and I think this issue is related to the Forge stall issues earlier this year.<br/><br/>In part, it's a question of what the indie game movement is for.  Are people designing games for a small group of peers to enjoy or for those guys plus a wider market?  If the former, that seems to be just about working though enjoyment increasingly doesn't seem to mean play, if the latter then excess volume is rightly identified as an issue.<br/><br/>The big indie games are still DitV, MLwM, PTA and Sorceror.  How many of those came out in the last year?  Edit:  And I don't think it's at all a coincidence that the big indie games (I forgot BW actually) are the ones that see ongoing fan support in one form or another.                        </div>

                            Hey Max,<br/><br/><span style="color: Red;">...designers buy each other's games and don't necessarily play them, which creates a small demand bubble.

Back in the early 90's comic book publishers betrayed comic book fans by appealing to materialism and fetishism over solid entertainment value. And as fans started to lose interest the publishers ramped up their schedules, publishing more and more "must have" titles in an effort to extract the same amount of revenue from a shrinking customer base. And somewhere around 1993 the bottom dropped out of the market and 7000 comic book stores went under in 18 months.<br/><br/>Feel the heat of your wallet and tell me if there's any denying that we're selling each other an increasing amount of product. Look into your gut and tell me the entertainment value alone of the games you've bought recently is solid enough to sustain twice as much purchasing in the next twelve months.<br/><br/><span style="color: Red;">Are people designing games for a small group of peers to enjoy or for those guys plus a wider market?</span><br/><br/>A comparison can be made to the maturation of video game genres. When a genre (like real-time strategy, or first-person shooter, or whatever) is introduced, the games released have a broad range of features. With each successive generation of games in the genre the feature set achieves greater standardization, and fans who aren't being served drop off for other interests. The fanbase gets more and more hardcore. So what you get is an industry in which some game publishers (Xbox and PS3) are in a very high stakes competition for hardcore fans within established genres, and other publishers are working to create new genres (Nintendo).<br/><br/>Tell me you're not seeing the rise of a hardcore "indie" fanbase with increasingly strong feature expectations. Rather than an expectation of design excellence and entertainment value, the hardcore expects specific mechanics, or a specific kind of graphical production. I dunno, publishing indie games to the hardcore expectations of traditional gamers probably does result in sales for the games in question, but it certainly doesn't help grow the indie market. It catalyzes hardcore expectations into it that hasten the drop off of those who aren't being served.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

I mostly agree with you but this statement is a little misleading. All of those games took some time to develop their following and reputation. Ron likes to rant about how he built his following from the ground up. MLwM... actually I'm not terribly familiar with MLwM's development in this regard. But I know it took DitV about 6 months or so before it saw significant love. PTA as well took about 1-1.5 years before it really caught on.<br/><br/>So to say that newer games aren't that big right now ignores the fact that it takes time to establish those reputations. You have to wait 2 years or so before you can really say how popular a game is.                        </div>

How long does it take for a game to become "big?"  MLwM has sold 1000 or so copies in its lifetime.  Polaris has sold 600-700 in two years less lifetime.  I know timfire has similar numbers or a little more for the Mountain Witch.  Partially this is just an expansion in the demand for indie and small press games in general, but I think it's unreasonable to assume these games didn't get anything on their own merits.  In the current crop, I fully expect 2-4 of the games to enjoy the same level of success, and a number of other games to enjoy the success of Breaking the Ice or Universalis, which is to say not quite the level of sales, but strong influence and popularity.<br/><br/>I think that the "big games" view is slanted by your participation here and at RPGnet, which is very enthusiastically behind Dogs and Burning Wheel in particular.  That's cool, it's their home, their target audience, etc.  Polaris's popularity (again, I'm speaking about it 'cause I know) is within LARPing scenes (particularly Scandanavia) and the Everyway and Amber online communities.  I assume Tim has similar reserves for the Mountain Witch.  RPGnet can only love so many things at a time, after all, and one of them is Exalted.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Don't downplay Uni, Ben. It's at that higher level already with the release of the revision, and with the release of Shooting the Moon, I see Em's games getting there too. Most of the games I'm looking at on IPR have some serious legs, and it's because they are solid games. Over the long term I think there is a bigger crop than you realize that will hit the 1000+ mark. Indie games have a lifespan of years, and I'm not sure when the demand drops off, because I haven't seen it yet. There's typically a spike of initial sales, but then a really reliable plateau.<br/><br/>Another note: Though I haven't sat down and done a specific statistical analysis, I estimate about 50% of IPR's customers are first-timers. I have a core 50% of repeat buyers, but our volume is continuing to grow and the proportions aren't changing that much, which means there are some conversions of first-time buyers into repeat buyers. I don't think we've seen the full extent of the indie audience yet and it's still growing.<br/><br/>It's really cool to see someone from a specific town (say, Linkoping, Sweden) put in an order, then another, and then see someone else from Linkoping start to order, and then someone else.<br/><br/>In other words, despite the boom in new titles this year, it's not all doom and gloom.                        </div>

                            Guys, the point on the big indie games isn't the main focus of my post, so please don't get too hung up on that.  Of course I may be influenced by where I post and so miss things, Ben is correct on that, and timfire is right to note that popularity takes time.  Part of the issue though is what leads to that popularity and whether a glut of games could hamper newer games from getting the popularity they deserve.<br/><br/>That aside, I wanted to come back to some of Paul's comments.  The comparison with computer gaming is well made, but I think an even plainer example is to be found in current mainstream rpg design.<br/><br/>A lot of contemporary rpg publishing feels aimed at the collector mindset, the same narrow user base that gets narrower every year.  Many of the current trends in rpg publishing add little to actual play, but add a lot if you buy games to read and admire.  Hardbacks, colour art, in-game fiction, by and large these don't see use at the table but for the collector market they are key.<br/><br/>The problem though lies as Paul rightly says in the fanbase in part, once you get a core fanbase expecting certain features and then you cater to that fanbase because they reliably buy yes you get sales, but you get sales to the same narrow group of people.  Just like most mainstream rpgs currently aim to sell to existing gamers and to cater to what existing gamers expect.<br/><br/>To be honest, my post is redundant now it has sparked Paul's response, because he took the ideas I was putting forward and took them forward, I'd look at his now to see the points I was trying to make because he got what I was saying and has improved it in turn.  My example games were not my main point, my main point was about the dangers of designing to the expectations of a preset fanbase.  The danger, in a way, of talking to oneself in the way the mainstream of the hobby largely already is.                        </div>

                            Perhaps ironically I have little to say now, you've all done a great job with it.<br/>
<br/>
Andy, if you're ambivalent about it, then we're right together, I, too, feel that there's something to be said for a Darwinian winnowing that occurs at the consumer level.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Harper, note that the post that kicked this off wasn't aimed at pointing out some problematic trend. It was actually aimed at one specific post that was saying something like, "Look at this great play. I think we need more games that can use this good play as a jumping off point. Let's all come up with a ton of ideas that, hopefully, somebody will make!" And it's not even the riffing on ideas that gets me, but the feeling I got (perhaps erroneously from the thread) that a good idea for a game is a mandate that somebody should create that game.<br/>
<br/>
So this isn't some indictment on my part of there being lots of new designs. Only an indictment of any designer that decides to make a game without having a real vision for the game, and a willingness to see it through to excellence. Or any idea that gets people thinking that just an interesting concept is an excuse to write a game.<br/>
<br/>
Which, from the above, doesn't seem to be too controversial.<br/>
<br/>
I will also admit to being in the same boat as Thomas, in that I can't keep up with everything that's produced. Which means that, perhaps, the bad games in amongst the good ones, are particularly annoying. Since they're making it extremely hard to find the good ones.<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, I may simply have to trust to the filter of actual play reports made by others to find the good ones. I just worry that, at some point, we'll reach a horizon where some good new game never gets played.<br/>
<br/>
For example, has anyone actually played Keith's game yet - the title of which I can't even recall, but which was the one that sold no copies at the Forge Booth this year? I mean there was all of this furor that his game didn't get sold...has anyone played it yet? Such that there's an AP report?<br/>
<br/>
There probably is. But sorting through all of the AP reports has even gotten difficult. It may be a great game. But I have no way of knowing at present. At least no way of knowing that's not going out of my way to check it out over dozens of other potential games.<br/>
<br/>
I think that my retreat into playing mostly Hero Quest of late may have something to do with this. I may be going from a pluralist game player to a single game player (though that's just as likely something I've just said to illustrate a point).<br/>

                            How many indie games release second editions? I think fans would be much more likely to gather 'round and create a community if they know the game is "alive" (i.e. bugs fixed, rules tuned, house rules incorporated).<br><br>Burning Wheel has had multiple editions and it has a good-sized fan community.                        </br></br></div>

                            Oh, I think that most do good support, and you don't need a second edition to make people know the game is "alive." Just being available is best, I think.<br/>
<br/>
John, Brand, could also be that I just make myself an easy target by not thinking enough about the contexts of my posts. :-)<br/>

                            I am sure there are cool new things that haven't been tried for game support just as there are cool new things that haven't been tried for games. <br>
<br>
For example, I would love to see a PTA network wiki where people could post up play reports and link each other's shows together in a big mega-universe of running your dream TV network. You could also put house rules and such up too.                        </br></br></div>

                            I do worry about this a bit. Mostly, I worry we're creating a cottage industry driven by the desire to purchase and consume the "latest thing," for the sake of being able to discuss it, over actually enjoying the games and sharing the fun with people not normally involved in the hobby. (It's for this reason I silently appreciate the death of the Forge's theory forums, even as I miss them.)<br><br>At the end of the day, though, I keep in mind that the real benefit of the Forge publishing model is that even if your product is a total commercial failure, it's not like you're gonna lose the kids' college fund over it. (Which is always the sob story that seems to be implied by many traditional publishers.) You're smart enough to hold onto your day job. Given this, I'm totally fine with letting the market sort things out. "The community" doesn't owe you success; proper marketing is your responsibility as a publisher. (For balance, I'll comment "the community" doesn't owe you a bunch of sales-killing <i>grognard</i> fanboys, either -- but that particular ill seems to be thankfully rare in this corner of the woods.)                        </br></br></div>

                            I'd love to see more material along the lines of Sorcerer's mini-supplements, some of which are a pretty hefty meal in their own right.  I don't know but I suspect that at least some folks have bought Sorcerer so they could play Charnel Gods or Dictionary of Mu with it, for example.  That's a win-win situation.  Why couldn't there be more of that in the industry?                        </div>
