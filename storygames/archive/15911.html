How awesome would that be? Someone asks how their power works and you say "It works like that," pointing to an illustration of the power in action! I think it would work but I'm no artist, so to go that route with the development of the idea, I'd need a collaborator with some skill at drawing superheroic-style comic art.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm open to offers and suggestions: I don't know what direction further development of this idea will take, so this would partly be an exploration of a working model for collectible RPGs in general.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361634/#Comment_361634" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T08:55:39+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  8:55AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smells like a Kickstarter to me.

Any subset of the playbooks only contains the minimum you need to know to play a game with those characters in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
