                    So, people who are all "ooh, I'm into these pervy indy games, but I'm into traditional games too" now it's time to put your money where your mouth is and help me out with a D&amp;D 3.5 build.<br/>
<br/>
I'm debating some things about my character for Rich Forest's online game.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of background points: In this setting, the Elves are the only Druids, and the Dwarves are the only Clerics.  Humans that study Elven and Dwarven magic can become Rangers and Paladins, respectively.  Arcane Magic (sorcerers, wizards, and bards) is draconically based, and the dragons are the main antagonists of the game.<br/>
<br/>
This is cool, but pretty severely limits character options.<br/>
<br/>
My idea for a character is to take a human Fighter into the Blackguard Prestige class.  The idea is that he is someone who, unable to fight the Dragons who were conquering his homeland by normal means, turned to demons to give him the power to fight them.  Evil, but for a good cause :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately (I'm bringing in the character at level 7), there's no way to open Blackguard by level 7 without taking the Ranger class (Why is this effectively "anti-paladin" class built like this?  Anyone know Jon Tweet well enough to ask?)  <br/>
<br/>
The basic goal of the character is to be the best possible close-combat bad-ass.  He uses a great-sword, heavily specialized, and is heavily invested in that fighting style.  Feats are things like Weapon Specialization, Power Attack, Cleave, etc.  Essentially the basic Strength Fighter for D&amp;D.  Once I get into Blackguard, I may mix it up a bit with Quick Draw and some poisoned short swords.<br/>
<br/>
So here are a few of my starting character options, all of which will allow me to take Blackguard at level 8:<br/>
<br/>
4 levels of Fighter, 3 Levels Human Paragon (You can find Human Paragon at d20srd.org )  This will give me a nice attribute bonus, but that's pretty much it.<br/>
<br/>
6 levels of Fighter, 1 level of Rogue.  This gives me a nice set of skills to begin with, and also some sneak attack, which will be useful in conjunction with the Rogue in the party.<br/>
<br/>
7 levels of Fighter, straight.  This will totally sap my skill points as I'll have to take all my Hide cross-class, but doesn't involve a drop in BAB, and sets me up to dip back into fighter later on.<br/>
<br/>
1 level of Ranger, 5 levels of Fighter, 1 level of Blackguard.  This is the way to get to the class directly.  Unfortunately, it really breaks the themes of the game, so I'd rather avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of some other base class or easily accessed prestige class which gives full BAB and has the Hide skills as class?  Any **3.5 based** feats which will allow me to access a non-class skill as if it were class?  If so, that'd be awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, I'd be curious to get some opinions about the advantages and disadvantages of these builds.<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  If no one answers, I'll just drag my butt over to EN world or somethin'  But I'm hoping for some advice.                </div>

<p><em>Once I get into Blackguard, I may mix it up a bit with Quick Draw and some poisoned short swords.</em></p>
<p>If you're playing for raw power, don't do this.  Instead, wander over to two-handed weapons, including exotics, and shop there.   There's just more bang for your buck.  Reach, especially, is a good buddy to have.</p>
<p>Also, remember - stacking effects with damage are what you want.  A strength fighter is made to kill now.  So, in poisons, you want a high save, high initial damage, con damage specifically - to stack up with the high HP damage you'll do.  Secondary effect is immaterial; if you can't kill a foe in ten rounds, you're in trouble anyway.</p>
<p>Damage, now.  That's your watchword with a strength-fighter.</p>

                            Yes, yes.  The poisoned short-swords are largely mage-killers (remember, we're expecting a lot of fights with wizards) with int-sapping poisons, and str drainers for very large targets (dragons.)  I don't expect to use them a lot, but how could I not take advantage of the stacking of my poison use feature and save-penalty aura?<br/>
<br/>
And I already have a glaive and a composite bow for use with quickdraw.  Reach is, indeed, your best friend, especially if your buddy is a spiked-chain Rogue.  :-)  Kinda took that one as a given.<br/>
<br/>
As far as exotics, I was considering using the Great Scimitar from Sandstorm (1d12 18-20/x2) but I'm thinking that Greatsword may actually be a better deal -- 1/2 a point better damage and a feat for one point of crit range.  The fact that my big weapon is going to be Vicious Dragonbane (which isn't ideal mathematically, but that's what I'm getting from the GM) also makes me shy away from big crits, simply because all my extra damage dice won't multiply.<br/>
<br/>
But, then again, maybe there's a really good exotic two-handed weapon that I'm just missing.  Thoughts?  I'm not going the double-weapon route (too feat intensive) and I want to make sure that the Rogue keeps his spiked-chain turf.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  Here's my feat selection right now, based on the 3 Human / 4 Fighter build (although I think all my builds get the same number of feats).  Maybe you've got some nips and tucks to make.<br/>
<br/>
Pure Soul (from Heroes of Horror.  Immunity to Corruption.)<br/>
Weapon Focus: Great Sword<br/>
Power Attack<br/>
Cleave<br/>
Improved Sunder (blackguard entry requirement)<br/>
Weapon Specialization: Great Sword<br/>
Quickdraw<br/>
Improved initiative (I'm really skeptical about this one, trying to think of something better)<br/>

                            The level of rogue is very appealing to me. Those sneak attack dice are lovely, and since you'll be the one setting up the Rogue's flanking most of the time, you might as well get them too. Improved Init. makes a little more sense with sneak attack, too.                        </div>

<p>Well, the best two handed exotic is from Eberron, but I can't remember the name at the moment.  High crit, though, which doesn't love your bonus dice, so that might be a no-go for you.</p>
<p>As moment of pure twink glory, look over the two-handers, and then check conversions to damage for increasing creature size by one step.  If one of the weapons you already find nice suddenly jumps significantly, Monkey Grip from Complete Warrior may be <em>real</em> interesting as a consideration.</p>
<p>Improved Toughness, from the same book, is also always worth a thought - if the game will play up for quite a few levels, it just gets better for you.</p>

                            Well, the question is if it's worth the cost.  <br>
<br>
If it's going to *be* a greatsword, for sure, the answer is no.  -2 penalty, +1d6 damage?  Power attacking two-handed beats that flat; -2 penalty, +4 damage.<br/>

There's a few weapons where you get more.  Been a while since I did this, though.                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
Monkey Grip is probably out.  We're fighting mostly things with the Draconic template or Gnomes, which means massive ACs, so I'm going to need every scrap of attack bonus I can get.  Any damage boost I get from a larger weapon (as tempting as it is to have two giant Cloud-sized scimitars on my back) just isn't going to be worth the -2 (or is it -4?) to hit.<br/>
<br/>
I can twiddle with the base weapon to get better results (use a d12 base, etc) but ultimately Power Attacking is just better.  Basically, the only way to justify it is to switch to a sword+shield fighter and use a large Bastard Sword (one handed, 2d8), which I'd just rather not.<br/>
<br/>
Levi, you wouldn't happen to have the stats for that Giant Eberron Weapon handy, would you?  I don't have the book, but it intrigues me, especially if it's a sword of some type, and extra especially if it gets 2d6 rather than 1d12 damage (I like more dice, 'cause I don't trust luck.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, so here's another great topic for the character.  If I go Human Paragon, I get one skill that's always class for me (and no, it doesn't have to be hide -- I can get those ranks straight from the Paragon class).  What do you think should it be?  I'm wavering between Use Magic Device, Spot, Sense Motive, and Diplomacy...<br/>

                            I dumped my Eberron books a while back - my whole gaming collection is actually slowly contracting, overall.  The thing was more like a souped-up scythe, though, in style, and I'm pretty sure it ran off 2d6.<br/>
<br/>
High AC says to me that straight bonuses to hit and damage are what you need.  Hm.  If you have an arcane caster or a "magic item budget", remember the strength-boosters.  You'll want them, in spades.<br/>
<br/>
2d6 beats 1d12 every time - average is raised, minimum is increased, and you have *stability* in damage, which matters to a solid beatstick.<br/>
<br/>
For skill, consider keeping Improved Initiative and cranking up your Spot.<br/>
<br/>
Getting nailed by an ambush?  Ass.<br/>
<br/>
Not getting ambushed by an alert foe?  Good.<br/>
<br/>
Getting the drop on a foe like that, and high initiative, meaning potentially an ambush for you and a new action at the top of the next round?<br/>

<br/>
The GM has essentially told me that he's willing to have me buy magic items at market prices, reflecting propiations and sacrifices to my demonic masters, so I'm going to have enormous control over my magic item progression.  (With the starting gold of a 7th level character, the best I can do is +1 vicious dragonbane greatsword + masterwork greatsword for non-dragon fighting + non-magical full plate.)<br/>
<br/>
There are no arcane casters in the party (or even the world) that can enchant, so this is pretty huge.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very tempted by the strength booster items, of course, but I'm going to have Bull's Strength by level 10, which is a +4 that won't stack with the items.  Would I be better just buffing up weapons and armor?  Is there a convincing argument for strength boosters (at least, +4 and under boosters) as opposed to Bull's Strength?<br/>

                            Any "fighting spellcaster" like a ranger or a blackguard should take all his spells in things that are usefully cast outside of combat.  During combat he's almost always better off swinging his sword.  Go for the strength-booster items; you want all the bonuses you can get to damage, if you're fighting dragons.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, consider taking a falchion rather than a greatsword, angling towards the "improved critical" feat, with as much strength boosts as you can manage.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Just a personal opinion moment here, so take it for what it's worth.  I can't tell you how much Improved Initiative sucks.  In every game that has combat based of rounds where weapons have different speeds, having a lower speed is absolutely useless.  <br/>
<br/>
So what if you go first?  Ever dropped an enemy on the first strike?  Not very often, and I'm betting it wasn't a major NPC.  Using a fast weapon or buying down your initiative is so senseless in these games.  There's no advantage to it because everyone is going to get their chance to go.  Whether you're using a dagger or a claymore, you're chance is going to come around.  The difference is in raw damage.  In that round the dagger is gonna give you like 1d4+STR damage.  Wow.  What's that compared to a great sword or battle axe that still gets to go in the same round?<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, acting first limits your future options.  Say the situation changes slightly in the middle of the round.  Say a more effective opportunity comes up.  If you're using a fast weapon, you've already gone and the chance to take advantage of that opportunity goes to someone else.  If you're using a slower, higher damage weapon then your options are open longer.<br/>
<br/>
So okay, I'm calming down.  Here's the bottom line.  In games with rounds, fastness is really overrated.  Raw damage is what you need to focus on, IMO, Ben.  If I had my Player's guide with me here at work, I'd give you some more specific advice.  I'll try to do that once I get home.  But unless "Improved Initiative" is required for the Blackguard prestige class, I'd drop it for something that will make your character more effective.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            The problem with the Falchion (or it's exotic equivalent, which is 1d12 base) is that both of the mods on my sword are non-multiplied by crits.  To that end, I really want a weapon with as little "oomph" in its crits as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I were really a proper twink, I'd take the 1d12 18-20 sword and give it Flaming Burst or some such, but I and the GM are really attached to Vicious Dragonbane as a matter of color.<br/>
<br/>
Bull's Strength is clearly a prep spell for combat, along with magic weapon, corrupt weapon, etc., all of which last in the order of minutes.  Now, if we get surprised in the night by a young adult Black, that's all for nought.  That is a pretty good argument against relying on Bull's Strength, actually.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that most of my spells are going to go for cures, though.<br/>

P.S.  Hrm...  And also 2nd level is Death Knell, which gives unnamed bonuses to Strength!  Yowch.  Okay, we're definitely moving over to Giant Strength item + Death Knell, rather than Bull's Strength.<br/>

P.P.S. Moot point at level 7, though.                        </div>

<br/>
All in all, I agree.  Do note that weapons don't have initiative in D&amp;D3, so my greatsword is as fast as a dagger.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the reasons initiative is good in D&amp;D:<br/>
<br/>
1) It helps enormously in surprise situations, essentially allowing you to get a "retaliatory strike" on your ambusher, as Levi noted.<br/>
<br/>
2) If you are a giant damage monster, it can matter because you can drop 2-3 weaker enemies in a round.  This is doubly true of you cleave.  In a party without a serious front line (which this one is), this is enormously helpful.<br/>
<br/>
3) It gives you more opportunities to ready your actions.  Why is this good?  Because you can use it to disrupt enemy spellcasters, which is pretty much the goal of every fighter.<br/>
<br/>
4) Fights in 3.5 rarely go past round 4.  The "extra attack" that winning initiative gets you actually matters a great deal in preventing damage pile-up.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Improved Initiative remains my weakest feat, and if someone has a recommendation to replace it, I'm more than willing to hear it.  I'm curious, for instance, about the merits of Bull Rushing, which is not something I've explored at all in previous games.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, it is possible (though not likely) that someone could redeem Great Cleave in my eyes.  Skill Focus: Use Magic Device might very well also be a good idea.<br/>

I'm totally with you on the thinking big.  This guy's name is Sharif abdul-Murrah.  Murrah is one of the three names mentioned in the Koran as cursed, that you should never give to any child.  It means "bitterness."  The other two mean "emnity" and "king of kings."<br/>
<br/>
(Backstory: Sharif was an upstanding minor noble in his city.  The sudden invasion of dragons has forced him to turn to evil forces to try to defend his homeland.  I'll never say D&amp;D couldn't do politics.)<br/>
<br/>
My problem with the Wizards optimization boards is that:<br/>
1) They are too focused on 20 level builds.  This is honestly the biggest deal -- it's a massive blind spot.<br/>
2) They are too focused on player-vs-player builds, which are worthless for my purposes.<br/>
3) They have no respect for color.  I would have a bunch of people telling me that it makes a lot more sense to go Paladin first, or take a level of Ranger, or that my sword really should be +1 Flaming Burst.  All of which are true, but beside the point entirely.<br/>
<br/>
They are excellent at what they do!  But I thought I'd try out Story Games and see what I could raise here.  I see D&amp;D builds as a social activity, and y'all are my friends and acquaintances.<br/>

                            Hi Ben!  I agree with some of that, but I've found that if you stipulate exactly what you're looking for, they're pretty obliging.<br/>
<br/>
Two Things:<br/>
* Why must the character *start* as a BG?  Why not go Paladin, show his failure to stop the monsters, and then he turns to the demons?  It would be one hell of an openers, and make a vivid impression on the other players.<br/>
<br/>
* Ranger probably offers more than Fighter.  Dragons have enormous attack bonuses, and can probably bonk you even if you're wearing good armor.  So, go light and keep your mobility.  You also get Evasion, which helps avoid breath weapons, and better saves.  It also helps you a bit with the notion of dual-wielding, for situations where it's needed.                        </div>

                            Good points.  Basically, the reason I'm taking the tack I am is strictly setting based, and also around the party as it stands.<br/>
<br/>
While Paladins can be human, the pre-existing Paladin in the game is a fanatical scholar of Dwarven society and culture, and a convert to the Dwarven faith.  Likewise, any Ranger in the game should have a similar relationship with the Elves.<br/>
<br/>
I was interested, primarily, in playing an Arabic-themed character, for lots of reasons.  Rich and I pretty much flat-out agreed that there were no Elves nor Dwarves in that part of the world.  So it would really be breaking color for me to be a Ranger or a Paladin.<br/>
<br/>
(secondarily, I think that Paladin-&gt;Blackguard is actually underpowered, unless you have exactly 11 levels of Paladin.)<br/>
<br/>
As I'm joining an on-going campaign, it makes sense for me to be leaving my homeland.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a thematic point here, tied into the racial stuff.  The reason that he isn't (nor ever was) a Paladin is because Humans have no divine magic.  The gods that the Humans worship, if they exist at all, exist in the manner that gods exist in the real world.  They do not grant miracles on demand.  But the demons that the Humans fear do exist.<br/>
<br/>
That's interesting.  At least to me.<br/>

                            Oh, right!  Stupid me.  So it becomes a matter of trading off Rogue and Fighter levels.  <br/>
<br/>
I recommend Rogue 3 (representing the dissolute life of a spoiled aristocrat), followed by Fighter 4 (no time for ribaldry, we're at war!).  This suggests a couple of NPC's--a family authority figure, shamed by his earlier conduct, but proud of his martial success.  A local gangster, who doesn't fully comprehend what's happened.  Someone who loves him, and wants to save his soul.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to R1/F6/B1, you'd have 1 less feat, but would acquire evasion (good vs. breath weapons), +2d6 sneak attack, improved trap finding, and improved skill selection.  Saves are identical to R1/F6, and arguably better than most "straight" builds.  You've got lower HP's, but you have more options for later advancement.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Feats: you have 6 feats available with R3/F4/B1, and half of them are entry requirements.  Since Feat Trees represent fighting styles, it makes sense to evaluate who else is in your party and work to complement them.  <br/>
<br/>
In a vacuum, I'd recommend choosing one of these progressions...<br/>
<br/>
* Point Blank, Rapid and Precise Shots - never fight a dragon up close!<br/>
* Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Great Cleave - tank<br/>
* Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack - rush in, sneak attack, move on<br/>
<br/>
The last is interesting because you can work up to Whirlwind Attack if your stats permit it.  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding skills: might want to make heavy use of Intimidation (it's a class skill for all three), and possibly Diplomacy.  It would be cool to boss people around.<br/>

I don't know magic items very well yet, so... can't help there.                        </div>

                            I like to take feats that fit the Color. For that reason, if I'd build an Arab fighter, I'd give him Endurance instead of Improved Initiative. That can then be followed up with Diehard, especially if magic is somewhat rare (I don't know how good your Rogue friend will be at stabilizing you, the tank of the party, when you get into negative HP).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm more versed in Rogue builds or Dex Fighters, so I won't be much use helping with a Str Fighter (I like adding Dodge-Mobility-Spring Attack to a Reach weapon as an unusual Fighter build, supplemented by Combat Reflexes for fighting multiple enemies; add Quickdraw for when I'm cornered; overall, it's flexibility over single-sided effectiveness).                        </div>

                            A reach weapon, like a pole-arm, might be a really good idea, for non-trivial reasons:<br/>
* A 2H weapon gives bonuses to Sunder stuff<br/>
<br/>
* A 2H weapon gives you more damage with Power Attack<br/>
<br/>
* Some pole-arms give bonuses to trip--and once someone's on the ground, you can use Sneak Attack b/c they've provoked an Attack of Opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
* With a reach weapon, you might be able to get away with wearing lighter armor, allowing you to cover more ground.                        </div>

                            Okay, guys, just to clarify stuff from higher up the thread:<br/>
<br/>
I have a non-Rogue option.  That's Human Paragon.  I have the class linked up above.<br/>
<br/>
I am using two-handed weapons.  My specialization is Greatsword, unless there is a superior exotic somewhere.  I have a glaive for reach, and several other back-up weapons.<br/>
<br/>
And a couple of other clarifications:<br/>
<br/>
Due to the constraints of an online game, range-specialization is not an option.  I will have a composite bow, but I don't want to spend feats on it.<br/>
<br/>
You don't get sneak attack bonus on any attack of opportunity.  This doesn't actually have to do with my build, just with the D&amp;D rules.  (James -- as it it turns out the follow-up attack from Improved trip does give you the bonus, not because it is an AoO, which it isn't, but because the target is prone and thus loses their Dex bonus to AC.  Niggling.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay<br/>
====<br/>
<br/>
I've come to some conclusions from this thread, I'm pretty sure.<br/>
<br/>
1) I'm going to do Human Paragon 3 / Fighter 4, almost certainly.  I may end up switching this to Rogue 3 / Fighter 4 (thanks, James!), but giving up the +2 Strength is just painful.<br/>
<br/>
2) Adamantine Greatsword: Ho!<br/>
<br/>
3) Death Knell + Belt of Giant Strength &gt; Bull's Strength.<br/>
<br/>
4) Almost certainly sticking with the Greatsword as the main weapon.<br/>
<br/>
5) Still looking for a feat better than Improved Initiative.  I'd love to hear from people who've done things with Bull Rush or Overrun.<br/>

                            Count me as another vote for Improved Initiative. That +4 means you're 20% less likely to go after the enemy wizard with the one-save-is-all death magic.                        </div>

                            Ben - Consider taking Rogue 3 instead of Paragon, seriously.  If nothing else, you'll get 4 more skill points per level (and for god's sakes, if you do, take Rogue as your first level; the zillion extra skill points are more than worth the loss of 2-4 HP).  Evasion won't do you much good if you're running around in plate mail but you can get reasonably AC from, say, a mithril breastplate, which counts as light armor and has a -1 Armor Check.<br/>
<br/>
If you're going Rogue at all, Improved Initiative is nice because it gives a better chance to go first after the surprise round and catch your opponent flat-footed for your sneak attack.  It's nice for Blackguards, too, but they're not quite as awesome at sneak attacks as Rogues.  Another possible feat is Blind-Fight, which I am generally quite fond of because of its overall utility, and which might be good for you because you're really going to want to hit that arcane caster who just cast Invisibility or Blur or Mirror Image as soon as possible.                        </div>

                            The character has been played since this thread was last really active Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ben posted a few thoughts on it <a href="http://rpgtalk.net/benlehman/weblog/37.html" rel="nofollow"> at his RpgTalk weblog</a>. He ended up going with the Human Paragon 3 /Fighter 4 angle, and he's done something very interesting with the Human Paragon's "Adaptive Learning" class ability: he's selected "Use Magic Device" and made it the skill he permanently treats as a class skill. <br/><br/>The reason this is particularly interesting requires context. The game setting came out of a chat session among me and the other players to make a setting, a decision that grew out of the material in <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>. This would have been over a year ago, when we first started it up with 1st level characters. Anyway, everyone had characters sketched out before we decided to brainstorm a setting, and we noticed early in the setting brainstorming process that we didn't have any arcane casters in the party (we had a Human Paladin, Human Rogue, Elf Druid, and Dwarf Cleric). <br/><br/>So someone suggested just saying arcane magic is <i>evil</i>, which has interesting fallout when you start looking at where and how arcane magic crops up in D&amp;D. We'd decided right out the gate to just play D&amp;D RAW, so you've got bards, wizards, and sorcerers as evil-y, and many magic items, and then hey, gnomes, their favored class is Bard... elves, wizard, hm... and then there's the obvious "sorcerers are tied to dragons in D&amp;D," so the dragons are an obvious choice for being at the root of all evil. Anyway, we didn't set much in stone -- an intentional move on our part. Later we decided to add the Taint rules from <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>, connecting it to all arcane magic, and we updated on the rules front again when <i>Heroes of Horror</i> came with a better implementation of the taint system. <br/><br/>Now to get back to the interesting thing. Ben's given his guy "Use Magic Device" as a class skill. And he's taken a feat (from <i>Heroes of Horror</i>) that makes him immune to the physical and psychological effects of taint. And you know, his guy hates the dragons and the sorcerers and their tainted magics. Bitterly. Bitterly enough to, say, make a deal with a demon to strike at them. (Pimp my Blackguard, anyone?) And the party? All are seriously committed to this conflict with the dragons and the arcane because the conflict was created after the characters, and they were hooked into coming up with it to begin with. Questions abound, and we learn new things all the time, 8 levels and a year into the game. What <i>is</i> going on in the Elven Courts? We haven't gone there, so nobody knows. (And I mean nobody -- I'm GM and I don't know. I've chatted with the player of the Elf Druid and he's also interested in taking a "wait and see" approach.) And there have been questions about strange artifacts, and prophecies, and all that, but no one really knows where the dragons came from originally, where the evil magics came from, etc. etc., but the PCs are all serious about taking the dragons and sorcerers down. Hard.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing. Ben's guy. He has Use Magic Device. He can use these evil arcane magic items. He could, say, use them against their own makers. <br/><br/>Will he? And how are the others going to react if he starts doing so? <br/><br/>Anyway, this is why his Adaptive Learning class skill choice is so interesting.<br/><br/>Also, human paragon did let him do something else Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while keeping a reasonable BAB, feat progression, and getting that kickass +2 attribute bonus at 3rd level. It let him get plenty of skills, including a heinous Intimidate. And since I use "Let it Ride" on D&amp;D skill checks, man, he has used it to serious effect. Just one time, so far. But to serious effect. <br/><br/>Of course, that's gonna have repercussions...<br/><br/>Rich                        </div>

                            Yeah, it basically did. It was kind of a circular process -- very early on there were a couple settings on the table, one a roughed out setting idea I'd had and the other Mystara from the basic D&amp;D products. Then folks started making characters, and at some point in this process we decided not to use either of those settings and to hash one out later. So they went ahead with making characters. The longest "backstory" was a few sentences, and others were about a sentence. Concept type stuff. And then we started hashing out the setting, with these characters already sketched out. The characters were all more-or-less filled in as far as race, class, stats, etc, plus the concept stuff, but in a flexible enough stage that they could be molded as needed during the process of filling in more setting.<br/><br/>Basically, the characters as they existed at that point and the D&amp;D rules acted as points of reference for setting creation. Each character provided a point of reference, and as new elements were added to setting, e.g., "Ooh, hey, what if arcane magic is evil!" that becomes an additional point of reference, which we then followed down through how arcane magic works in D&amp;D. During play, new points of reference are added, and various connections get canonized either during play or during post-game and between game chit-chat. The network of "canonized points of reference" is centered on the character sheets, a few events from play (especially those that ended up on the character sheets), and D&amp;D rules. The single points of reference with a long shadow is "arcane magic is evil," which itself came from noticing something <i>not present</i> among the characters, so again going back to them as the primary points of reference. <br/><br/>In introducing his character, Ben has added a new point of reference, with a whole bunch of implications of its own. In particular there's the whole new fact that evil and taint aren't directly connected. You can be of evil alignment and not be tainted, and vice versa, and it's taint that is tied to the dragons and arcane magic, properly speaking, in game mechanical terms. What's key here is that the relationship between evil alignment and taint/corruption was not elaborated before Ben made his Blackguard. Anything that is not elaborated isn't a point of reference yet, hasn't been canonized. We simply hadn't even considered it. Sure, maybe we had assumed evil and taint to be one and the same, and certainly the taint of the dragons and sorcery is evil in a colloquial, English language sense. <br/><br/>But not necessarily in a game mechanical sense, you see. We never would have known that, though, if Ben hadn't come up with this idea. <br/><br/>And this sends interesting waves across past decisions. One of the players, during setting creation, proposed that the giants were "on our side" as far as being opposed to the dragons and the corruption of sorcerers, and everyone went, "cool." And they've shown up in play in that respect. <br/><br/>But until the creation of Ben's character provided an elaboration of evil, it never occurred to me that, duh, the giants can still totally be evil. They just aren't tainted.<br/><br/>There's other setting stuff that came through similar chains of elaboration. But that's the basic process.                        </div>

                            Man, it just seems like you're on the cusp of making this into a define process that could be used for other D&amp;D games, other just other games period, maybe even a game unto itself.

                            The bedrock for our process was the ideas about setting presented by Ron in chapter 3 of <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>. (Well, plus related ideas throughout the book.) That book changed the way I think about fantasy roleplaying :-) I'm putting it in my own words, and how I think and talk about it has been influenced by my interest in discourse processing, but yeah, <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> was the foundation. <br/><br/>D&amp;D turned out to be interesting because the system is intricate, and if you're committed to using the system as is, you discover new implications of your earlier decisions as you go. You have a relatively small set of points of reference, but you also have this big, intricate point of reference in the D&amp;D rules, and you find yourself later on, in play or after months of play, elaborating on a connection you hadn't realized was there. Fun stuff. <br/><br/>We've had good experiences so far -- best of luck to you guys too, Mark and Stefan.                        </div>

                            From a mechanical standpoint --<br/>
<br/>
The character has seen one session of play.  So far, my major concern is that he's a "glass cannon --" he can deal out astonishing amounts of damage but is basically incapable of taking hits at all.  This is largely due to two effects:<br/>
<br/>
1) Low constitution, which is just my own fault.<br/>
2) That his only source of AC is his non-magical full plate, which is simply not an effective defense at 8th level or higher.<br/>

                            Yeah, I'd forgotten to mention that if your party were pretty much eschewing magical equipment that the D&amp;D balance would fall off. Class defense Bonus from Unearthed Arcana has worked well for me in the past.                        </div>

                            The magic item situation has been interesting -- part of the fallout of making arcane magic evil has been that, as you've just noted Mark, a lot of magic items become tainted.<br/><br/>But not all of 'em. Both divine and psionic items are fine, and it's thrown into somewhat clearer contrast for me just what magic items are being made by clerics and druids vs what items are being made by arcane casters. The good news is that magic armor can be enchanted with pluses just fine with divine magics, and all the other currently active PCs have some item of magical armor or a magical shield. What sucks is that the newly added front line fighter, Ben's guy, is the one who doesn't have any magic armor. <br/><br/>So yeah, he'll need some asap. At the time he created the character, though, it cost him all the money available to a 7th level character to get a rather badass sword. The good news is that the party leveled up last adventure (Ben couldn't make it for that session due to being in between computers, a situation that'll be remedied tomorrow), and they're in a pretty magic rich dungeon crawl, and he has that "pure soul" thing. So he'll have plenty of options, up-coming. He just has to survive long enough to get the armor upgrade.                        </div>

                            In the meantime there are some spells your cleric can use to give him a boost in combat.<br/>
<br/>
Magic Vestment and Shield Other are nice long-duration spells that can give the character a lot more staying power.                        </div>

                            I just had this mental image of being presented with a golem with badass armor, having to find some way of ripping it off of it, and then, due to its lack of defenses, finding the golem defeatable.<br/><br/>But then, almost everything I think of in D&amp;D is 'undoable' by the rules.                        </div>

                            Well, in that particular case, it's probably not unrealistic to be impossible.  I can't imagine how I would try to remove the armor from someone as big and strong as a golem while it was fighting me.                        </div>
