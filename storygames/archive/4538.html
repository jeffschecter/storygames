Its a great fantasy setting that engages players and rewards them for playing their characters.  <br/>* I also suggest Truth &amp; Justice if you're interested in supers.  The system allows you to move away from the crunch found in a Champions game and the damage system actually helps write upcoming plots<br/>* Reign could be a good long-term game, too.

(Do they value a system that rewards more skillful play as they learn?)<br/>* Do the players value a detailed setting that long-term play illuminates different portions of?<br/>* Do the players value consistency and continuity, bringing back a limited number of elements in different combinations and situations?<br/><br/>There's probably a lot more reasons to enjoy long-term play, but the design choices you make for your campaign will vary considerably depending on what part of it you like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102738/#Comment_102738" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T12:58:23+00:00" title="October 12, 2007 12:58PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am here because someone told me I was being asked a question.

Certainly, we didn't talk about Advancement in the game as anything more than a handful of suggestions of how to do it.  But I think it's pretty easy, with a *consistent* group of players, to take SOTC into a campaign rather than episodic mode, letting folks pick up another point of refresh or a stunt every few sessions of play.  Still, SOTC's conceit is that the characters are already at the top of their game, so much of the rest of the character "advancement" stuff talks about change rather than expansion: swapping out or shuffling around skills, aspects, and stunts in response to the events of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I think you can adjust most settings to most of the systems under discussion. I mean if it were D&amp;D you wanted to play, I'd say stick to a setting that has lots of support. But you can play TSOY or FATE or HQ in pretty much any detailed setting. HQ comes with Glorantha, but I've played my long-term games in an entirely different setting. I ran my one and only FATE PBEM in a homebrew setting. TSOY could have run either of these well as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's arguable that both setting and system can be better suited to each other, to be sure. But I wouldn't reject, say, FATE based on the fact that it doesn't come with a detailed setting to explore. I'd love to see somebody do a FATE Tekumel game for instance. Or TSOY Jorune. Or HQ Talislanta. How about Burning Empire in the world of RIFTS, with the Vaylen replaced by whatever realm's culture is the "invasion" force for another? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat last might fit your overall profle best?

It's set up as a mission-oriented game, so you could gradually introduce some of the strangeness of the setting, and as Agents get promoted and Personal Static comes into play, you could really put the weirdness into focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103483/#Comment_103483" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T13:34:28+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  1:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2007 1:41PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a semantic argument to me, Clinton. But fine, you can play a game using any setting, and a system that is identical in it's mechanics to TSOY's mechanics, only removing the setting specific keys and secrets and replacing them with ones that fit your setting. A process which is, by the way, fun and informative. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr am I still wrong, Clinton? It was just easier to say play TSOY in any detailed setting. I think people understood. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. people have varying ideas of what long-term play is, I guess, but Lacuna... I would agree that it's meant to be played multi-session. But I wouldn't equate multi-session with long-term play. No, I don't suppose long-term has to mean indefinite, but I'm personally definitely thinking of the term in terms of potentially years of play. I'm not seeing Lacuna doing that... and that's not a slam at Lacuna. It's just way too powerful to drag out for that long.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S. that's either Hero Quest 2, or Other World you're interested in. The former being the version of the QuestWorld project being produced by Robin Laws, and the latter being the version that I'm creating with Mark Humphries, and Scott Mathis. There is no QuestWorlds any more from anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you knew that, but there's a lot of confusion going on about the games in question, and I like to keep that as controlled as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103501/#Comment_103501" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T14:48:19+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  2:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>...people have varying ideas of what long-term play is, I guess, but Lacuna...

I generally think of "campaign" or "long-term" play as four months or more. I think that may come from my gaming background; a lot of what I played happened at my university's RPG club, and those games were cut into chunks of 16 weeks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103503/#Comment_103503" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T15:05:13+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  3:05PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At one point 2 was being called HeroQuest Core but no idea if that title still holds, but it would let us shorthand Core Vs.

Nixon</cite><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>[<i>citation needed</i>]<br/></blockquote>\nTSOY is tied to a specific setting, which means if you play in another setting, by definition, you're not playing TSOY, but, yeah, I know, that's not an argument most would agree with. Still, there's lots and lots of detailed settings that you can't play TSOY in. If they have gods with a physical presence in the world, or even an overpowering disparity between abilities of sentient creatures, TSOY won't work for it.<br/><br/>Clinton, not to be a pain in the ass, but "is it"?  Is TSOY really tied into the idea that gods aren't around?  Because, maybe I'm dense, but I don't see that.  Certainly, that is part of your design idea and certainly it is behind the Setting of TSOY in a HUGE way.  But mechanically?  I don't see it.  There is nothing about Keys or Bringing Down The Pain or Secrets that screams out to me;  "no gods".<br/><br/>Consequently, mechanically, TSOY seems like it can be the engine to run several types of fantasy... certainly Conan, Elric or a Freeport to a Game of Thrones type game.   Now... granted... I will buy the argument that TSOY won't do a world where PCs are expected to be everything from 1st LvL to 36th LvL in d20 parlance.  It might not be able to handle martial arts ubermenschs... Weapons of the Gods was built to do precisely that.  <br/><br/>But off the top of my head, Gods and Big Monsters would be easily stated out with God/Monster dice and big pools to draw upon.  Plus Keys and Secrets would certainly be developed for them easily enough.  Sure, it ain't baseline TSOY anymore...but isn't it still TSOY?<br/><br/>Now, I'm totally a believer in not using a wrench to pound in a nail.  But if someone uses TSOY to run their Birthright or Midnight or Planescape campaign... they are using TSOY in as much as any of us use a game system at the table.  And very few (I daresay NONE) game systems in my experience are used 100% unchanged from the text at the game table.  Social contracts, tweaks and drift all figure in.   So no one is using a game system verbatim anyway.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm really curious in your feelings on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103528/#Comment_103528" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T18:29:39+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  6:29PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2007 6:33PM by Andy.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Storn</cite>Clinton, not to be a pain in the ass, but "is it"?

But now that he's put the ball into play, I'll dribble for a bit. This is also a reply to Mike H above.<br/><br/>So yeah, what Clinton said, but as a player who used a homebrew world for a year (think Fantasy Chinese Stargate), here's the things that need to happen to use TSOY and have a good fit:<br/><br/>"No monsters. No Gods. Just people." I think that was the tagline. Clinton emphasizes it again with the mention of Gods and the wide skill range above. But in any case, here's why:<br/><br/>* Monsters. Monsters are there to fight and overcome. You can't like, all of a sudden, stop killing a monster in the eye and then start negotiating with it or becoming friends with it. This MUST be a possibility in TSOY, because that's the way the rules work. You can literally cook a meal for a monster to charm it while it tries to attack you. <br/><br/>For that reason, settings with "monsters", that is creatures whose only intention is "I kill/eat the character" and nothing else, just does not work right in the rules. It's a total shoehorn, and from experience it makes the game unfun: It makes it slow because every missed kill-roll means that you're engaged in another one-way Bringing Down the Pain with only two possible outcomes: It dies or you die. Most classic settings don't support a team of 3 famous adventuring negotiators who charm bugbears and settle territory disputes for drow and xorn. This has to be a possibility, because it's a possibility (and encouraged) in the rules.<br/><br/>* Wide range of abilities, or in other words, "unbeatable foes". Like "gods". Anything, ANYTHING that appears in a TSOY game has the possibilit of being overcome by one person. Yes, it is quite literally possible for a child with a fruit knife to kill a Terrasque or elder Red Dragon. Or punch Elminster in the cock and make him cry like a baby in front of the Black Hand at Zhentil Keep. In the default setting in TSOY, there aren't "Red Dragons", "Gods", "Elminsters" etc. However, if you use the TSOY system and introduce an opposing force, the rules make it possible to overcome at any skill level (of course easier at higher skill levels, but not impossible at low skill levels). <br/><br/>Counter that to, say, even other games like the 1ed Conspiracy of Shadows. It is possible for a group of dudes to not be able to overcome an evil witch, because that witch is statted thus that the highest roll cannot penetrate her defenses (many games are like this, mind). It is expected that the charcaters train/gain xp first before taking them on.  In TSOY, it *must be the case* that a 1st level barmaid has a possibility, however slight, of killing a heavily plated Death Knight of Krynn in one hit from a rock. If you say such a thing can not happen, then the world is probably not suited for TSOY.<br/><br/>Further, on the sly I learned that the best adventures for TSOY happen in places where there is always contact with other NPCs: LIke city or community environments, not wilderness environments. And even better, if the game is set within a localized area and not just "travel around and do adventures", in order to make reoccuring NPCs meaningful (so that you can take Key of Love and stuff with them).<br/><br/>So again, to summarize:<br/><br/>* No "Monsters"<br/>* No "Gods" or "Powerful people that can't be punked, however unlikely, by children carrying sticks". In D&amp;D, it is impossible for a 1st level hero to overthrow Zhentil Keep, stab Elminster to death, or go after a terrasque with a spoon. In TSOY, it is possible (though of course not "common")<br/>* Possibility of escalating a conflict from a swordfight into a tea ceremony or negotiation.<br/>Then, helpful:<br/>* Set in places filled with NPCs<br/>* Generally set in a localized area, not wandering all over the place from new town to new town like Final Fantasy.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: On Gods: Jason runs a TSOY game one-shot where you are Aztecs who are on a mission to kill three Gods (or secretly save them, etc). By the nature of the game, the Gods are killable as they have stats just like PCs (albeit powerful, but imminently killable. I know cause we did). If that's cool in your Gods and Mortals game, then it works. But if you want heroic Gods who bellow orders from the clouds, who cannot be overthrown, talked down to, etc, then it won't work in TSOY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103601/#Comment_103601" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T06:39:34+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  6:39AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Storn</cite>Clinton, not to be a pain in the ass, but "is it"?
