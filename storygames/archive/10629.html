Then, next year, after a bit more playtesting, I release "British Pulp Exploration Company: The Early Years". The year after, it's "British Pulp Exploration Company: The Power And The Glory". And so on.<br/><br/>So here's the plan.<br/><br/>When someone publishes a game like this, let's ask: <i>Is this a finished game?</i>*<br/><br/>We'll probably get a happy, dismissive answer. <i>Hey, my group's had a lot of fun with this game, so I just wanted to publish it and share the love, you know? And if people want to play it and give me feedback for the next version, that would be awesome.</i><br/><br/>Then let's ask: <i>Are you publishing this as a finished game, yes or no?</i><br/><br/>And if they still don't answer, the default assumption must be that, if money's changing hands and there's no warning the game is unfinished, it's a finished game. So then we can go ahead and review it on RPG.NET, under the title "The British Pulp Exploration Company", and say it looks a bit unfinished.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>(Although I'm using my outspoken voice for this post, these are opening remarks about something we ought to discuss, rather than an invitation for a fight. It's just clearer this way. Otherwise, every sentence starts "Sometimes I wonder if..." and "Does anyone else think that..." and everything gets muddier.)<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* Note: for ashcans, the answer to this will be "no", and that's fine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235596/#Comment_235596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T05:13:57+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  5:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What games are you talking about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235598/#Comment_235598" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T05:31:49+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  5:31AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an example.<br/><br/>Mist-Robed Gate is listed on the back as being the "Cursed Seal Edition." We did this because:<br/><br/>- Ben suggested that the cover looked like some kind of cursed seal and we thought that was awesome<br/>- We have vague plans to release a super-luxe edition in the future with color art, academic essays on wu xia, more recipes and compiling more of the free supplements and alternate rules into one edition<br/>- When that happens the cover will probably change<br/>- Shreyas loves titles and being verbose<br/><br/>For the games I can think of that have cutesy subtitles, it's more than okay to assume they're finished. The ones I can think of off the top of my head: Polaris, Annalise, Time and Temp, MRG. Bliss Stage too, but Ben makes it really clear that Bliss Stage is not a final edition, both when you buy it and when you read the first couple pages of the PDF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

The idea was to present a portion of the setting as soon as the d20 Future material was opened up by WotC and follow that up with a larger setting book. It was never intended to be the full setting, but it was certainly complete for what it was presenting, i.e., a single planet in the system where the setting takes place. The name was rather humorously ironic as production was delayed for several months principally because I found out my artist was plagiarizing someone else's material. I'm not sure this fits entirely with your point as it was a setting book for d20 Modern, but I thought I would post anyway since it fits your naming convention to a tee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235614/#Comment_235614" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T07:38:06+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  7:38AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, in addition to the games E listed, I've got a game that does this, although it's still in playtest.

And I speak only for myself on this, but here's why I'm publishing Annalise the way I am:<br/><br/>* I want to showcase a number of different artists in the book. I haven't been doing too well with this because of my personal slowness in getting everything together, but between Jenn, Elizabeth and a couple of other artists that I'm working with right now, there's a ton of amazing art inspired by the game, too much to fit in one book. If a potential customer is struck by one persons art over another, I would like them to be able to have that.<br/><br/>* I like giving people choices. Most people seem to buy the red cover, but I've received compliments on the white cover as well - since I can provide both through lulu at no increased cost to myself, why limit that choice?<br/><br/>* Cutesy names create atmosphere, and the production of the game is all about atmosphere. The system itself is relatively content-neutral, so I'm relying on the book itself to convey how I like the game to play without dictating a specific set of actions to players.<br/><br/>*Other than the Eternal Tears PDF edition (which I think is fairly clear that it's a PDF version of the game) and the Interim edition (which is always available through lulu), the different Edition names are for convention releases - the Seven Sins edition was a short run of hand-made books for DexCon, and the Unbidden Guests edition is what debuted at Gen Con in 2008. I think it's a more significant marker of where and when the game was released than "1st edition" "2nd edition" etc. <br/><br/>*Honestly, I'm pretty sure that the atmosphere (including cutesy titles) is part of how the audience for the game self-selects. Sure, it rubs me the wrong way when someone who doesn't understand tells someone else something about the game that isn't true, and when I see untrue statements about my game posted on the internet I feel like it's within my rights to correct them, but I guess that's what I have to deal with.<br/><br/>*Finally, none of these version are revisions, they are all the same, finished content. It's a choice of production and presentation, or depends on when and where you encounter the game, but nobody needs to buy it twice.<br/><br/>Just wanted to throw out some reasons for choosing this path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235633/#Comment_235633" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T08:35:00+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  8:35AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Each Verge playtest edition has had a cutesy title.

It's annoying to try to divine the publication status of a game from its name. This is especially annoying when I end up retailing a dozen copies of some game that is actually an ashcan that will be republished in a year. This is even worse from my viewpoint as a retailer than just publishing a shitty and unfinished game - at least in that case I can just sell the shitty and unfinished game instead of having to sell something that has a "best before" date and shouldn't even be in retail.<br/><br/>On the other paw, I like the idea that an artist can organically and honestly express his development in the publications he makes, instead of trying to artificially keep up a veneer of productization. Obviously I don't find my own decision to call my Solar System booklet the "2008 edition" annoying; I find that the choice to do that helps me emphasize the idea that the game is an on-going process and tradition, one where somebody might or might not publish further editions one day.<br/><br/>As far as I know, Ben Lehman invented the funky naming convention. I did not have trouble with Polaris in this regard because Ben was very clear to me that the onehundredone brothers edition or whatever the first one was was already a finished game. (I also think that we didn't know to be afraid of unfinished work in 2005.) With Bliss Stage Ben screwed himself quite nicely by naming the first edition "Ignition Stage" and declaring that he would be publishing a more comprehensively illustrated color edition in half a year. I think I bought into a preorder at the time, too. It took me about year and a half to figure out that Ignition Stage was actually the end-point of Ben's design process and therefore could be said to be the "complete game". I have to imagine that others have suffered from an equal level of confusion, which must have been a part of why the game hasn't sold as well as we expected after Polaris. I'm still a bit leery about buying a large stock of Bliss Stage for retailing purposes, as Ben might get inspired to finish that new edition at some point.<br/><br/>In summation, I don't hate what Ben and others do - I think it's nice and sort of fun that they can exercise their independence by reflecting their individual, unique creative process in how they publish. I do this too, nobody can claim that it was smart to publish my new edition of The Shadow of Yesterday with a new, different name. I imagine that I'd be annoyed with myself as a customer, but still I gotta respect my own freedom to mess up however I want. I'm not paid enough for this to make me optimize my marketing, and I imagine that the same goes for Ben and Nathan and others as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235671/#Comment_235671" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T10:39:27+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 10:39AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone who has issue with my edition naming procedures can file a complaint with <a href="mailto:mattsass@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">my complaints department</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235690/#Comment_235690" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T10:59:39+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 10:59AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: reaction</cite>Another point: If your game is marked as "First Edition," that might be enough to give me pause.</blockquote>\nWhen I finally print Verge, I will clearly mark it 7th Edition.

If I mention specific games early on, the whole thread becomes a rather defensive thing about those games.<br/><br/>As it is, we've had various people talk about why they're publishing different versions under different names. I was clear, in the first post, that I was talking about <i>unfinished</i> games. So I'm not talking about Nathan and Elizabeth's strategy of publishing finished content with different layouts (although it's interesting to hear their thought processes behind it).<br/><br/>What Eppy's doing, if the game's still in development, is an example of the thing I'm complaining about. I hope it goes well for him, but I worry that, if someone buys the game one year, they'll be confused when they see an updated version the next.<br/><br/>What Levi's doing is certainly what I'm complaining about, especially since there's no indication, on the Cog Wars' Lulu page, that it's a "semi-ashcan". It certainly looks, from the art, like a finished game. I think that's irresponsible.<br/><br/>And, having explained why I didn't name specific games, I do want to briefly mention Sign In Stranger. We've played Sign In Stranger, in our gaming group, and it's a deeply wonderful game. But, having bought one version one year, people might be confused to see a different version the next.

In the idea we had, the core rules of the game would remain the same, but along with the change in art there would be more recipes, more resources on wu xia, and a few optional, additional rules sets to change the flavor slightly (chapters with the same format as the Forbidden Tiger Manual supplement). So more like a collector's edition, or the RPG equivalent of when MMOs release "battle chests" with the original game bundled with all of the expansions. So it's like, hey, you can still play this game on its own, but if you want to do new stuff here it is!<br/><br/>I don't think the basic and fundamental rules set of Mist-Robed Gate will ever change.<br/><br/>Also: I think what Eppy is doing is pretty different than what Levi's doing. Eppy's not selling an ashcan or a semi-ashcan or anything, right? It's a finished game. He's just separating handmade versions of the finished game from mass-printed versions of the same game.

And the distinction is rather important because most people purchasing an RPG these days expect a tidy little perfect bound book, not something that looks like <a href="http://dig1000holes.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/curious-about-what-time-temp-looks-like/" rel="nofollow">a medical file</a>.<br/><br/>I'm 50% sure that for every Graham that's confused by the title, there's someone who sees it and thinks, "<i>Unbound</i>? No thank you. I prefer my games bound." I much rather Graham didn't purchase the game than sell it to someone who's going to be pissed because it doesn't fit next to <i>Dread</i> on his bookshelf.<br/><br/>I'm 75% sure that for every Graham that's confused by the title, there's someone who sees it and thinks, "<i>Unbound</i>? What's this mean? I must investigate further." And as this someone investigates further, they can't help but to learn more about my game. Which is a win for me and a win for them.<br/><br/>And I'm 99% sure that Graham's confusion is the product of a community that makes up a sliver of a percent of the RPG purchasing public at large. The members of said community all have three things in common: they're exceptionally well educated when it comes to what's out there in the world of RPG; they have pretty amazing research skills, just in case they don't know a particular something about a particular RPG; and they all know they have access to me if they have any specific questions about my game.<br/><br/>So I appreciate Graham's concerns, but I'm 99.875% confident they're not an issue in my particular case.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>What Eppy's doing is an example of the thing I'm complaining about.

Any material I produce for the game from now until I die, will be PDFed and sent off to anyone who bothered to let me know they have an <i>Unbound Edition</i>. This is mainly for the filing shtick--something they can print out and add to the file jacket. I'm working on mini-supplements to release to them throughout the year to reinvigorate people about the game. But these updates also includes any other version of the game that may come out, such as the <i>Paperless Office Edition</i> PDF. So I've got my customers covered there. I try to keep an open line of communication, which doesn't always work, but I do what I can.<br/><br/>Because I'm evil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235873/#Comment_235873" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T08:11:08+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  8:11AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tork</cite><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>If you're releasing finished games, with different covers and layouts, then cool.

But I think that only because I don't like hearing that calling it "Zero Edition" wasn't clear enough for one of my actual customers.<br/><br/>But you're <i>weren't</i> one of my customers before it was clarified, so far as I know.  And you currently are clear on it - and the majority of customers became so <i>from the RPGnet listing</i>, which is also very clear on the "more development".<br/><br/>None of this strikes me as a responsibility.  It strikes me as an improvement I could make to get a better customer satisfaction, which is measured in happy-people-units, and therefore good.

The reviewer has to be fair to the author/producer but the reviewer's ultimate loyalty has to be with the consumer. And if the game isn't what it appears to be, the reviewer must say that.<br/><br/>Again, speaking as a consumer, I think the cutesy names for different "editions" are fine as long as it is very easy for me to figure out why I might prefer one edition over another, or whether one is the "current" edition that supersedes previous editions. If, instead, it is like some Microsoft Vista Gold Family Office Levitation edition that I have to contrast with the Microsoft Vista Platinum Single User Apotheosis edition, I will assume that cutesy titles are more important to you than clarity and sales.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236021/#Comment_236021" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-06T20:28:23+00:00" title="October  6, 2009  8:28PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Hey Graham, if I were to boil your suggestion down to a single sentence, it would be:<i>Be honest about the state of your game, and if it's unfinished communicate that directly</i>.</blockquote>\nThere's something funny about that expression - and it's the same something that's been nagging at me from the original post.

I honestly have no idea what you're doing with Cog Wars or anything else you're putting out. Haven't really followed it. I'm just saying it's good policy to set your audience's expectations correctly and very clearly explain what it is they're getting. If you're asking for money for something that you <i>know</i> is incomplete in some way, saying so is not only the right thing to do, but it may actually improve sales (i.e. word of mouth from people whose expectations are exceeded).<br/><br/>Your specific product's messaging is a marketing question.

I'm not pushing it like a madman in part because there <i>will</i> be a later and more finely-ground first edition, and in part because I want people to look at the content, and buy the game that <b>is</b> rather than the one at my table, and in part beause..  I'm not sure how to sell it other than by showing it.<br/><br/>So, here's an attempted shill for you:<br/><br/>At my table, it's fucking <i>dynamite</i>.  Jokes are made and then incorporated into play, silliness ensues and then suddenly goes grim and punk and mean, then we dork around with rules and do a thing, and back again.  The transitions between these states are completely smooth.  The thing it does well for us is that it flows <i>with</i> our play like it was some strange liquid.  And by play, I mean "we mess about, like kids; we <i>play</i> with the game".<br/><br/>At your table?  I'd be stunned to hear it didn't go; I don't know enough to make claims further except "A couple dozen people who've tried it and told me about it are generally pretty happy.  Some of them had questions about play, but they were all about whether they did it 'right' when they improvised something, not about how they couldn't get it to go.  Oh, and they did it right, because you're supposed to be improvising with the rules."<br/><br/>Uh.

Let's get serious.<br/><br/>I've heard about Cog Wars. Let's say it's word-of-mouth. The name goes by in some thread and I'm "huh!" I want to buy it. First place *I* go is Google. Once I get past the obvious bad search match, <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/5407668" rel="nofollow">I find this link.</a> <br/><br/>Cool, so it's on Lulu. "Zero Edition." What the fuck is that? My first gut reactions, combined with a price of $5 and the fact it's a PDF, are:<br/><br/>* Ashcan, yuck. Probably doesn't even work right.<br/>* I make a weird/funny association with Japanese fighter pilots and set that aside.<br/>* I wonder if I'll be able to apply that $5 to the actual printed First Edition (along with the implied assumption that there will be a First Edition)<br/>* I wonder what "102 half letter size pages" actually contains.<br/>* I want to look at those 102 pages. I see there are three "utility PDFs" but no way to get to them via that Lulu page. No linkie. <br/><br/>So that's my first go. Next up I see, oh, there's a user review! Hot! I scroll down. It's robospam for Ugg boots. Obviously the publisher rarely comes to the site to check on things since all there is is Ugg spam. WTF. <br/><br/>I like that you address "who the game is for." I don't like that you don't mention it's an RPG. I am in fact ASSUMING it is an RPG. Is it? I have serious reservations about the current hotness to bypass the whole "is this an RPG or should we treat all RPGs as 'just games'" thing making the rounds.<br/><br/>Oh wait...okay, I see "roleplaying" in the list of key words. Not prominent enough IMO.<br/><br/>"Hijinks....background of a serious nature" is jarring and unpleasant to me. Being told something is "serious" feels too on-the-nose. If I want hijinx, I want a Toon/Paranoia-like vibe. If the background is "serious" but you're using that seriousness to paint a broadly melodramatic setting, I'd explain it that way. Basically I don't want to mix my Toon with my Carry.<br/><br/>Whoa whoa whoa...just saw Lulu's "preview" button. Lame, but that's on Lulu. Suggestion: Put in your hype graf "To see the first 15 pages, click on the Preview button under the book."<br/><br/>Oh man...the preview is a wall-o-text. I'm bored by page 6. Closing the preview window now. Nothing else on the Lulu page entices me. Hell, I reopen it and keep going.<br/><br/>Page 10: "How To Play: Homeplay" catches my eye. YES. Ditto Missions. Now I'm seeing what I give a shit about. And...then more walls o' text afterward. Too dense, no subheaders, no explanation of what I'm about to read *other* than the main headers. Bored. Bored. Bored. Back to Lulu.<br/><br/>I'm still wondering what "Zero Edition" means. Maybe his publisher website will explain it. Oh wait....there is no link to a publisher's website, or blog, or anything else. It is impossible to track down the publisher online via Lulu.

I see there are three "utility PDFs" but no way to get to them via that Lulu page. No linkie.</blockquote>\nWait.  What?<br/><br/>*pokes lulu page*<br/><br/>The logged out view doesn't match the "What the customer sees" version I get when logged in.   That's...   Distressing.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I like that you address "who the game is for." I don't like that you don't mention it's an RPG. I am in fact ASSUMING it is an RPG. Is it? I have serious reservations about the current hotness to bypass the whole "is this an RPG or should we treat all RPGs as 'just games'" thing making the rounds.<br/><br/>Oh wait...okay, I see "roleplaying" in the list of key words. Not prominent enough IMO.<br/><br/>"Hijinks....background of a serious nature" is jarring and unpleasant to me. Being told something is "serious" feels too on-the-nose. If I want hijinx, I want a Toon/Paranoia-like vibe. If the background is "serious" but you're using that seriousness to paint a broadly melodramatic setting, I'd explain it that way. Basically I don't want to mix my Toon with my Carry.<br/><br/>Whoa whoa whoa...just saw Lulu's "preview" button. Lame, but that's on Lulu. Suggestion: Put in your hype graf "To see the first 15 pages, click on the Preview button under the book."<br/><br/>Oh man...the preview is a wall-o-text. I'm bored by page 6. Closing the preview window now. Nothing else on the Lulu page entices me. Hell, I reopen it and keep going.<br/><br/>Page 10: "How To Play: Homeplay" catches my eye. YES. Ditto Missions. Now I'm seeing what I give a shit about. And...then more walls o' text afterward. Too dense, no subheaders, no explanation of what I'm about to read *other* than the main headers. Bored. Bored. Bored. Back to Lulu.<br/><br/>I'm still wondering what "Zero Edition" means. Maybe his publisher website will explain it. Oh wait....there is no link to a publisher's website, or blog, or anything else. It is impossible to track down the publisher online via Lulu.
