The kids found some of my gaming die and asked me what it was for.  I told em it was for playing certain kinds of games called roleplaying games.  They asked how it worked and then immediately asked to play.  I quickly realized I had no games on hand that were good for kids their age range (4, 7, and 15).  The 15 year old could obviously handle your standard rpg, but the minute I bust out the rules for anything even remotely complicated I would lose the other two and they'd probably go on an unholy terror full of kid energy.  So... with their inspiration, I created <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Warrior Princess</span>, an RPG for ages 4+.<br/>Here's the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3TMkYb-oWtZDV0czM1NFNjRkE/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">PDF</a> and here's a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3TMkYb-oWtQXJPbUpVVE1JR0E/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">JPG</a>.<br/><br/>There's a lot of weird mechanics in here.  For instance, the game is based off a d10 roll, because that's the first die those kids found and wanted to roll a bunch.  Then they found some of my other die and kept begging to roll them as well, hence the d4, 6, and 8 found a home within the system as well.  <br/><br/>I also tried to shoehorn someway to get these kids to learn, so there's small bits of addition/subtraction and fact recall built into the system. Surprisingly, the kids really liked the spell casting system cause they got to brag about weird facts they knew.<br/><br/>At any rate, this was kid tested and adult approved.  I hope you enjoy it.  If you manage to run it w/ some youngins of your own, please let me know how it played.  (For mixed gender groups, I called it Warrior Princess and Prince)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dbrown" title="dbrown"><img alt="dbrown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/133/nMWVBVRKLGUBK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dbrown">dbrown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444260/#Comment_444260" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T00:58:47+00:00" title="March 19, 2015 12:58AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, I can't wait to try this with my kids.
