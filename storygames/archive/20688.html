It requires very little to make it seem fresh and new (which actually makes me wonder how they couldn't manage it with the new Star Wars movie?).<br/><br/>I really like the suggestion to treat it as advice for the <i>player</i> rather than the GM: find iconic things for your character to do, and "role models" for her to emulate.<br/><br/>Here's an issue with this, however:\n<blockquote>Then our hero has to fire at a small target with limited ammo in the hopes of saving the world. Then he must escape before the cave collapses around him (just like when the Deathstar exploded).</blockquote>\nThis kind of scene in a movie tends to work not only because of the setup and its conditions... but also because of its <i>resolution</i>.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, change the resolution, and the scene no longer works. In most RPGs, you are supposed to determine outcomes based on player decisions and (often) some random element. This means the outcome will vary, *even* given typical decisions. <br/><br/>So, while this advice is useful, I think it's not complete (for most people's purposes - some gamers are very happy to play on a railroad!) without another piece of technology:<br/><br/>How do you then transform these dramatic moments into something gameable?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454145/#Comment_454145" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T22:34:42+00:00" title="June 23, 2016 10:34PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How do you then transform these dramatic moments into something gameable?</blockquote>\nNot to speak for the OP but I got the impression that the technique was about wringing "aspects" from the scene, inserting them into the game, and then letting the game resolve itself using the gloracle, "the glorious oracle of dice and prep".<br/><br/>Luke Skywalker messing up the trench run sounds like an interesting possible outcome to me.

Like Fate, throwing in a ton of FP, Luke is probably going to succeed (including some pretty far fetched ones like "Ben knew my father" etc). Fiasco, the group can get a feel for the sort of outcome woud be best and hand the right color die. FFG Star Wars, any failure will spin into more story moments depending on what dice come up with the failure.<br/><br/>I also figure that there are plenty of examples in fiction of glorious failure.

I mean, there are many ways the attack on the death star could have worked. Perhaps the first plan included a trench run with a low probability of hitting the target, but players often come up with better plans than that, and blocking them from doing so <i>because that's not how the scene on the movie goes</i> it's just denying the true fun of RPGs, <b>to play to see what happens</b><br/><br/>The actual keyword around the warrior is Action. Whatever scene you frame, if you want to  play it to the warrior tastes, the obvious thing to do in that scene is to take action. You let the warrior (and only the warrior, because nobody else in the group can read enemies and the timing of their attacks like her) notice a weakness in the huge enemy or in whatever challenge is put in front of her, a weakness she can hit. Perhaps she can't notice it at the first strike, perhaps she needs to study the opponent a bit more. Maybe the player can come up with something by herself in which case you roll with that. Maybe you add some clues here and there or maybe you just inform her directly because it makes sense her character will notice. But she will know.<br/><br/>So well, you can steal one scene premise to help you design that, but then you need to be totally flexible about what happens next. You can steal a totally different scene conclussion depending on whatever the players do. It might start as a Star Wars Deathstar trench run, but if it ends as Aragorn's charge to the Black Gates that's perfectly okey too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454170/#Comment_454170" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T17:57:13+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  5:57PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2016 6:08PM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going by the article take on this, it seems that the keyword around the <b>Sage</b> player type would be <i>Thinking</i>, in which case you inform only her player about small clues she needs to put together in order to solve the challenge. Perhaps some of the pieces she needs are already on her inventory or spell list, or are part of the party. Perhaps the pieces needed are more lore she needs to find somewhere else. Specifically for casters, the main eventual goal of solving these puzzles however should be somehow related to power, as in "power she can use to solve bigger challenges" or maybe even going the warrior way, since actually everybody loves to solve something by hitting it hard, every once in a while.<br/><br/>Then you have the <b>Thief</b> type that is somewhat like the sage sometimes, but which also has the Stealth keyword. This is a player that you need to give opportunities involving a high risk. She's a gambler, that's why she is using a character that can't face violence directly. She's thrilled by creating the chance to deal with a challenge in one hit. Give her the chance, put shadows and places to hide in the scene, put a single strong enemy or many lesser ones that need to be deal quietly to not sound the alarm. It's okey if chance doesn't let her do everything in her way, since losing is part of gambling, but never forget to give her the chance or trying.<br/><br/>Then you have <b>The Face</b> type, which often doesn't need a clue to turn a situation into a social challenge; the GM just needs to give her the opportunity to make it that way, and often the rest of the players themselves work as enough of an obstacle into that. The warrior will definitely try to attack before speaking and the thief would often d something that would rise suspicion and make diplomacy more difficult. Perhaps the best way you can help the Face type get her fun is to make clear other approaches will be way harder right now, so at least she gets an uninterrupted chance to try her way. Maybe just let the other types of players know that not interrupting until the talking is done doesn't mean their own characters are standing doing nothing. Like, don't let them interrupt until the talking is done, whichever way goes, and then give them an approximate amount of rounds (as the time the talking took) to prepare something under the specific criteria that it shouldn't be anything that draws atention.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454173/#Comment_454173" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T18:33:27+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  6:33PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2016 6:33PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm find that latter approach to be a little too heavy-handed about what the characters <i>can do</i>.<br/><br/>The original article, about the Warrior, was much closer to the character's values - not just their abilities, but also their philosophy and their role in the story. If we're watching an action movie and the warrior-hero suddenly gives up fighting and turns themselves in to the enemy, it had better be because a) they are using their position of strength to sacrifice themselves for someone else, b) it is a ruse to catch their enemies off-guard, or c) they are making a tragic mistake (often because they've been outsmarted by the bad guys) but <i>they will turn around soon enough and correct this mistake in judgement</i>.<br/><br/>Anything else doesn't suit the archetype, and changes our idea of the character - as an audience, we would be caught very much off-guard. Now, I very much love both stories and games where this kind of expectation-breaking happens, but it's a very different kettle of fish from what the article is intimating (stories about an Archetypal warrior-figure who fulfills his or her role's expectations, and how to help them do that). <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(In Forge terms, it's the difference between Story Now the Right to Dream, in a pretty strong sense.)<br/><br/>As for issues of railroading, the main thing which led me to bring that up is that all the examples in the linked article (like the one I quoted) very specifically outlined a situation *and its outcome*. If we're talking GM advice and presenting things that way, we're leaving out a major component: player choice. Perhaps a railroaded/Illusionist approach is precisely what the author intends, in which case it's fine. However, if it's not, I would encourage them to make it much more clear in the article.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454179/#Comment_454179" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T20:10:15+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  8:10PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you're right, I was speaking more of my take on it, not trying to sustain the article point of view; my bad.
