I very much dislike patronizing tones and that's all I've ever felt from many Forge folk.  I tried to read those threads but no matter the points given by the original poster, I can't empathize due to the tone of the arguments.  <br/><br/>Which (happy happy) is very very different in my reading and experience from the style of folks here on Story Games.<br/><br/>Overall, though (and back on topic) I still don't see how or why NOT selling in the most widely known/used distribution sources (for game PDFs) is beneficial.  Many people have disdain for distribution like Diamond (with comics/games)  or  mass-market mega-box-stores like Wallmart  -  but sales and marketing recognition (that you GET from those sources) in most cases far surpass the costs that may hit a personal dislike of business practices.  That's from a purely sales/marketing point of view.  I can understand if the principle is more important than selling your product as a reason for not utilizing those larger "middlemen".  I don't agree with it.  But I understand it.  <br/><br/>Getting distributed to the maximum potential and taking minor hits (in terms of cost/sales) is IMHO much more important than distributing against in an uphill fight for recognition in a niche of a niche of a niche category such as independent RPG book/PDF sales.  It would take a major ground-swell to get to the level of advertisement when NOT a part of a large/known distribution chain, compared to the immediate recognition received by going through the middleman.  Its simple cost/benefit analysis.<br/>Some managers (me) would prefer getting my work in front of as many eyes as possible to garner sales and interest, at the same time following-up on all the other areas such as shipping the product on-time and having solid customer service/feedback through Actual Play examples and Q&amp;A online in forums such as this...<br/><br/><br/>I'm not saying I'm right and they're wrong but I'd much rather have my product on an endcap at Wallmart and deal with the necessaries than slog-through the effort of getting people to see it through the half-dozen mimi-marts that might have less cost/challenges...<br/><br/><br/>I'd be interested to hear other's thoughts.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181563/#Comment_181563" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T12:48:49+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 12:48PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kev, do you want someone to go over to The Forbidden Zone and cut and paste the answers to your questions?

You've established your priorities which is good.  Being able to do business based on your agenda and priorities is what being independent is about.  The principles behind the un-store is not about doing it "better" than what's out there.  It's about providing a service that matches up with a certain set of publishing priorities.  It was created because nothing else out there matched those priorities, not because there was anything wrong with what already existed.<br/><br/>However, it's very clear those priorities don't match your own.  Which is cool.  It sounds like there are services out there which DO match your priorities which is also cool.  So everyone is happy.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181569/#Comment_181569" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T13:14:46+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  1:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And in the end, if you want the game, you search Google and find an outlet--in this case, the first hit on Google is Vincent's Dogs page, and there on the left is the Buy It stuff. Done, after a Paypal transaction.<br/><br/>If you don't "like" having to do that, I'm sure Vincent won't miss the sale (well, he will, but not so much that he will change his considered opinion about how he wants to distribute).<br/><br/>In the end, your posts seem a lot like the famous line from Blazing Saddles: "Nobody move or the n----- gets it!" You're only hurting yourself, and another day has gone by without you having DitV as a PDF.<br/><br/>Finally, Vincent does a pretty good job moderating the lumpley games forum on The Forge--it's nothing like some of the noiser, less specific forums (which, I feel, are still amongst the most polite and fruitful online... you every hung out at EnWorld or RPG.net?). So THAT "boycott" is probably just hurting yourself, too.<br/><br/>Just my thoughts... but, hey, I'm a Baker Fanboy, so I guess I'm willing to "suffer" the onus of clicking through a few links and maybe even filling out an Address form YET again.

I personally owe great thanks to Gregor Hutton for making sure I sold on IPR and RPGnow because I just didn't know those sites existed when I wrote my game. I wasn't a customer so I didn't use them. Sure research can cure that, but I am sure there are still other sites, which some segment of market would regard as a well known channel, that I don't know.<br/><br/><b>2 : Ease and Cost Effectiveness</b><br/><br/>Some channels are not easy to use. Some channels are not easy to actually get your product on even if you want to, because they do not accept all products (of course this doesn't apply to DitV <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>, or because they are not open to residents of all countries, or because they just make it hard to do! <br/><br/>Other channels are easy enough to use, but they consume so much profit in a sale, and take away possibly more profitable sales from other channels, that they really are not worth using. Just because something is the main distributor does not make it cost effective, indeed the more monolithic the service ... generally ... the worse value it is for the seller <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> A direct PDF sale makes me a little less than twice as much as an RPGNow sale as an example.<br/><br/><b>3 : Lack of Contact</b><br/><br/>Unlike some game creators I value the opportunity for personal contact that comes with a direct sale. When you buy a PDF from my website you email me, and I email you, and often we will correspond and talk about the game. I may persuade you to join my mailing list, or point you at useful threads. When you buy from another channel, that doesn't happen.<br/><br/>There are of course other reasons more important to other people, like the things pointed out on those Forge links                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181599/#Comment_181599" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T15:49:14+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  3:49PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kev, a big part of the benefit of being indie is the ability to do what you want, how you want, and why you want regardless of whether it makes sense to anyone but you.  That's why creator ownership is so important...because as the owner the creator isn't beholden to anyone elses sense of sensible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm with you on the points you raise myself.  The whole Unstore thing I find completely baffling...as in the explanations almost seem to be in some alien language that sounds like English but must not be cuz I still don't get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's AWESOME.  I think the unstore rocks on toast because its totally a vehicle that allows Vincent, Ron, et.al. to go do a thing that they feel passionate about in a way that's important to them.  While I, and other indie designers who have other priorities can go do our thing on IPR.  While Paul Czege can do his thing on his own website without any distribution at all.  And other folks can churn out PDFs on Onebookshelf and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's WHY we're indie in the first place.  So that we can make choices that mean something to us and to hell with what anyone else thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it make it a bit difficult for customers...potentially yeah.  That's something to weigh in the balance, but ultimately being maximally accessable to customers may well not be a priority...and that's totally ok too.  Besides part of the vibe of being a patron of indie arts is the super secret underground way you get access...which is its own thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you're totally right to ask the question...but just understand that there are no "right" answers except what each designer decides for themselves is right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181602/#Comment_181602" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T16:38:43+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  4:38PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm missing something: What is it that you want Vincent to do that he's not?<br><br>I mean, you can type the name of the game into google, and with a few clicks, you're at a buy page.

That's not the point.  When I was looking for Dogs (I really want a paper copy anyway)  I immediately looked in the places that I've bought other PDFs and couldn't find it.  Call me lazy and/or slow to think to look on the Dogs website...  but taking the time to set up an account or using Paypal, etc... something I don't have to do with using Drivethru/RPGnow it just frustrated me.  Enough to ask the question.<br/><br/>The questions here really have nothing to do with Dogs in specific (hence changing the title of the thread)  it was just the catalyst that started my questions.  <br/><br/>I've always felt that its more important to NOT give the audience ANY reason that makes it any sort of challenge to pick up your game.  Because that game is not available on RPGnow or Drivethru... I didn't buy it.  I probably won't buy it  (until I find a physical copy).  To me, that's a challenge the seller needs to fix - not rely on the customer to solve.<br/>True - the creator can stand on their righteous decision that I'm not a customer they want to sell too...  but you've still lost the sale.<br/><br/>Which is better - going that extra step for the customer  or  losing the sale?   <br/>Who cares if the customer is just a lazy bastard (like me)  or can't find it because they don't use Google so well...

To me, if I had something I was serious about Getting Out There, I'd want maximum market penetration (or whatever other semi-obscene term applies). So, as a customer, I expect people selling their stuff to make it easy to buy and easy to use.<br/><br/>This isn't everyone's motivation, however. Some people just want to experiment and see what business models might work, and how. Perhaps others only want specific sorts of people to buy their stuff, I don't know - quality over quantity seems to be an undercurrent. Others again have strong feelings about what's Wrong or Right in publishing games. Some people even have qualms about making their games too easy to understand and play - they're supposed to be experiments, not products.<br/><br/>So yeah. For me, as a customer, being told that "well, it's easy to buy if you just search the internet with the right words and register a new account on a web page or two"... that's quite a barrier. I've crossed it, because I'm obsessed with weird new games - and now I can get any game long before it hits the store (most of them never even do). Which probably means I'm the "right kind" of customer for some of these publishers.<br/><br/>But I would have liked the games to be cheap and easily available at my FLGS and all other outlets, of course. Including my local book store. But that's fantasyland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada" title="Torquemada"><img alt="Torquemada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Torquemada">Torquemada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181632/#Comment_181632" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T01:26:27+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  1:26AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevperrine</cite>Which is better - going that extra step for the customer  or  losing the sale?</blockquote>\nThat's an author by author question but, in the case of Mr. Baker, you already have the answer.<br/><br/>The fact that OBS exists doesn't mean it's a good fit for everyone.

That seemed to imply that you expected others to retype or re-express those points here, for you alone (and some were kind enough to do). That smack(s/ed) of obstinacy, much like your refusal to Google something and use the immediately available purchase channel (three mouse clicks from the first hit on the game name). And THAT seems a bit like the pot calling the kettle black--designers, presumably, should put "exposure" and "common channels" over their own predilections, and yet you refuse to shift from your own predilections to purchase through the channel(s) at which you've established an account.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Also, a lot of folks here know and like (or even love) Vincent, so you picked a tough row to hoe, opening any conversation in a manner that could be perceived as an attack on his choices and rights as a creator and successful game developer.<br/>-----<br/>Others have made the main points as to why an indie wouldn't go with a major distribution channel. In short, they are:<br/>* Cost and/or profit margin<br/>* Hassle/time investment<br/>* Control over presentation<br/>* Awareness<br/>* Lack of interest<br/><br/>As a data point, I will only offer my (eventual) products through Lulu (when possible--one will be a dice product, it looks like) because I want to go to press with a $0.00 budget. I am unwilling to invest in even a short print run, as my game(s) are rather speculative and, frankly, not too likely to sell heavily. To make a cost effective (per-copy) print run--requisite to being stocked at the sites you frequent--would mean a major cash outlay for me that I might need years to recover (or never recover). So I, too, will baffle and frustrate your marketing sensibilities, for unavoidable (for me) reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181685/#Comment_181685" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T08:58:01+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  8:58AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2008 8:58AM by lumpley.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs in the Vineyard is available in PDF and in print <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/games/unstore/game/1" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>It's not available anywhere else because I'm trying to use the strength of the game to draw traffic to <a href="http://games.indie-rpgs.com" rel="nofollow">the un-store</a>.<br/><br/>This seems pretty straightforward to me.

To me, that's a challenge the seller needs to fix - not rely on the customer to solve.<br/></blockquote>\nHere's my answer (speaking for no one but me). If the hassle and annoyance of dealing with a company is not worth the money I get out of it, then I don't deal with that company. Flat out, done, no guilt. I have a limited amount of brain power available to my whole "making and selling games" thing and I'd rather spend it on making games, rather than intra-store politics, tax receipts, or anything else.<br/><br/>There's a second point, which is that my goal is not particularly to sell games, but to sell games that will then be played. In that respect, someone who doesn't want a game enough to search on google for it. it is someone who probably isn't interested enough in the game to put in the social investment to play it. But that's really a secondary point.<br/><br/>Pursuant to you getting a hard copy, you do realize that this thing, people keep talking about it, where you google the name of the game? That leads to a site where you can buy physical copies. With any major credit card.

I just dislike the style of that Forge creator (from which those arguments were made)  because he is one of those Forge folk that I just have a natural adverse feeling about in regards to the way (I feel) they speak down (patronize) others...  There are have always been a few writers/authors on the Forge that I've felt that way about.<br/><br/>As I noted - I have yet to read, reply to, or in any way interact with ANY of that type of personality here on Story Games (although I thought it was going to happen with the first few replies in this thread... luckily the miscommunication cleared quickly)<br/><br/><br/>Honestly... <br/>I'm relatively new to indie games.  But recently I have a game gang that's been meeting on Thursdays and we've been slowly introducing ourselves to several of the "classic" and some of the newer (modern?) classic indie RPGs.  I've had nothing but GREAT experiences with them so for.  For example...  <br/><br/>-  Cold City... Unbelievably cool game!! and Malcom has been very nice answering questions of mine as well as in every thread I've seen him reply too.  It makes me really really want to try Hot War!<br/>-  My Life with Master...  Wow!!  Some of you might have read my actual plays of my hack - "My Life with Batman"... literally the ONLY game I've ever ran/played that at the climax/epilogue got a spontaneous applause/cheering from all the players!!<br/>-  Dogs In the Vinyard...  Very cool - even though we only played it one for a short session - I can't wait to play again.<br/>-  Trollbabe... while a little fun ('cause of the group and GM)  I didn't get so much.<br/>-  Roanoke... a freaking-cool-mazing.<br/>-  and while I haven't played it (yet) I can't wait to PLAY Primetime Adventures, because Matt Wilson was one of the first people I met when I moved to Seattle - I remember talking to him extensively about the idea for Primetime way before he'd drafted it...  And on top of that Matt and his lovely wife are TOP NOTCH people!!<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>Also, a lot of folks here know and like (or even love) Vincent, so you picked a tough row to hoe, opening any conversation in a manner that could be perceived as an attack on his choices and rights as a creator and successful game developer.</blockquote>\n<br/>Fair enough...<br/>My point though -  I want a copy of Dogs.  I've looked for 4 weeks at my local game shops and they can't get a physical copy.  I finally decided to look online for a PDF - the first (natural) place I go is a place I have an account set and can do basically one-click-shopping (RPGnow/Drive Thru)  and I can't get Dogs there.  I became frustrated and stopped looking.   <br/>Call it lazy - but when I'm crashing on my couch at 2am and get a wild hair to look for this RPG...  and I'm too lazy to want to deal with finding my wallet to type in my credit card info into a not as simple shop-system that I have to take xx minutes to create a new account for, which I have to wait to get an account confirmed...  etc... etc... etc...  I run out of patience and decide it's not worth it.<br/><br/>THAT is where my frustration (and the first question in this thread)  started from...<br/><br/>Clearly I have nothing against,  in fact quite the opposite,  for the Dogs in the Vinyard game.  I don't know the indie-scene well enough to know who the author is yet.  So I have nothing against him.  I just got frustrated at the hoops I had to jump through to find/get/buy this cool thing that I wanted NOW-SIMPLE, that I'd been looking for a print copy for a month for...<br/>Again... nothing against Dogs or the author. <br/>But this example, struck me with asking the questions,  posting the thoughts I have in this thread.<br/><br/><br/>And... at this point I have STILL not bought a PDF copy of Dogs.  And I have still not found a print copy.  And its been 5-8 weeks since I was first introduced to the game in our gang.  That... to me, is ridiculous that there's been that amount of challenge to me as a consumer that has detered me from being able to give money for the product.<br/>Yes.<br/>I admit - it's an amazingly little amount of effort (for some) to jump through these hoops... however, for as low a priority it is for me to get this game (even though I really like it)  it's all about the COST (of looking) to my BENEFIT (of getting) the game that stirs ALL of these questions.  At this point - my cost/benefit analysis is too high to make that effort.<br/><br/>And that's okay. <br/>If a creator can afford  (monetarily and artistically)  to choose NOT to make a sale to me.<br/>I (as the consumer) haven't lost anything...  But hasn't the creator?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>wow... it's too late... need to sleep - hope my rambling makes SOME sense.<br/>I'm really not arguing or slamming Dogs (at all),  I'm just curious about the reasons behind the choice to not distribute in the bigger methods to get your game out there to this niche of a niche market.<br/><br/><br/>I hope I don't come across as a jerk about all this.  <br/>Its a very interesting conversation.  <br/><br/>thanks<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181864/#Comment_181864" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T08:28:41+00:00" title="December  6, 2008  8:28AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin,<br/>\n<br/>\nGot nothin' but time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/games/unstore/game/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/games/unstore/game/1</a><br/>\n<br/>\nClick there, select the product you want, and click Buy Now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI overall get your point.

I understand this feeling well, I feel that way too when I see how others choose to act in regards to their game, their product, their finances, their correspondence and other social matters. But then I look at how my own actions look like from the outside, and I can easily see why things look so weird: we're overworked by our hobby, of course we're going to make all sorts of choices about even minor matters that seem incomprehensible outside. How can you explain it to somebody that you don't have the time or the energy or the will to do something he deems trivial?<br><br>Even when you might have the energy to do something, remember that you could be spending that time doing the things that interest you. Even more importantly, by not doing what the other guy wants of you, you're making your own value statement. My game is not available from any of the aforementioned webstores because I can't be bothered to research them, and they don't superficially seem like the sort of store where my game should be available. Independence allows me to make these choices.<br><br>But the first point is the more important one here: in the perfect world the game designers would service us all perfectly, but most of us have so much more interesting things to worry about that optimizing the sales is far from the first thing every morning. This despite the fact that we're not hurting the consumer (who presumably can get by perfectly well without us servicing him) but rather ourselves. That's tough, but we aren't going to get our distribution optimized without working on only that for quite some time, and that's all time taken away from actually designing and playing games. So in practice we're stuck with imperfect game distribution even when it seems insane from the outside to not take the five minutes / five hours / five days to utilize whatever is the individual outsider's favourite method of distribution.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181887/#Comment_181887" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T13:21:29+00:00" title="December  6, 2008  1:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kev,<br>\n  OK, regarding getting your game in an FLGS, here is an idea of what goes into it:<br>\n1) You have to print your book in quantities to fulfill distribution orders without getting paid<br/>\n2) You have to market your game to FLGS's<br/>\n3) The FLGS's have to order it<br/>\n4) You have to get a Distributor to pick up your title<br/>\n5) You have to be willing to wait 15, 30 or more days to get paid for all that after you ahve already spent your money.<br/>\n<br/>\n  On top of all that your profit per book is more than 50% less (the Distributor buys the book at 50% of the MSRP). When Vincent sells a book on the Unstore, he could, theoretically, make $12. If we only factor in the cost to print and store it (and I am sure he has other costs). If he sells it through a traditional 3-tier system, he might make $1 because he has to sell the book for $11 instead of $22.<br/>\n  Now, if he can pull it all together and get most FLGS's to buy a couple of copies, sure, that's a decent pile of cash (we can say maybe $3,000 hypothetically), but how much is spent on marketing to get the Distributor and FLGS to order those books? And that has to be spent sight unseen with no guarantee your game will actually be ordered. And on top of that, if he were to sell to FLGS's he would have to spend the money to print 1,000 books (or whatever the order size is) and not get compensated for 15, 30 or more days.<br/>\n<br/>\n  To be fair Vincent's costs are totally made up. I have no insight as to what his costs are at all. So, this is a theoretical discussion. Except for the very real fact that Distributors buy the books at 50% MSRP and don't order any books just because you offer them. And if they do order the books, they will buy them in huge quantities and want a quick turnaround.<br/>\n<br/>\n  And who knows, it might payoff, but there are costs involved. And there are risks involved. And there are other considerations such as the marketing, placement and control of your product. But putting those aside, there is a cost benefit/risk management process that has to take place before you can even approach Distributors. Even if you undergo to take that risk, there is no guarantee that the Distributor will pick up your title. For all we know (and we don't), Vincent may have tried to market ditv through the 3-tier distribution system and no one has ordered his books. I find that hard to believe, but it is a real possibility. And even so, given his latest endeavor in the form of the Unstore, it would undermine his own, separate business.<br/>\n<br/>\n  As to why other authors would reject the 3-tier system, it is a case of cost:benefit analysis/risk assessment. As well as possibly other philosophical considerations. Only they can tell you their motivations about why they would or wouldn't pursue 3-tier distribution.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I hope that helps, sorry some people got so defensive. I think that a lot of what you are asking has been internalized by many authors/publishers and so its a little like asking "why are you wearing that shirt?"
