If you're not down with Keys go study TSoY.  Then come back.  We'll be waiting for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, actually, that's a lie.  We aren't going to wait.  We're going to proceed without you.  You're screwed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so a Key like "Support authority" is a bribe to the player, right?  They do this behavior (which is presumably something they <i>chose</i> to be bribed to do) and they get specific tangible benefits:  in this case game-mechanical points.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's also <i>sorta-kinda</i> a bribe to everyone <i>around</i> that player.  If the GM provides an authority figure who could (conceivably) be supported then he is rewarded with <b>attention</b> from that player.  He's rewarded by getting the burst of spotlight that comes with being the guy who can hold out the first-order bribe.  That bribe to the GM that is encoded in the presence of a bribe he can offer the player?  That's a second-order bribe.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith me so far?  Okay, let's get funky!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was making the "Obedient" persona for <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, and I was thinking of something very like the above:  Support authority.  But, really ... that's a weak-ass second-order bribe.  It bribes the GM to introduce authority figures, but there's nothing more specific than that.  As long as they exist, the player will support them (whether they need it or not) and the GM gets the attention.  It's sort of like giving someone a Key that says "Breathing in and out:  1 xp."  It's not that it's too powerful ... it's that it's just not giving any interesting guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out how the second-order bribe changes when I replace "Support authority" with "Make excuses for authority figures."<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn't that neat?  Suddenly the GM is incentivized to make <i>questionable</i> authority figures, and all the other players are incentivized to question them ... all in order to set up the Obedient player for the chance to cash in on their Key-whatsis by making excuses for those authority figures in response to the questions and complaints levied against them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd all from an understanding of second- (and third-) order bribery.

The hard part is designing the key so that it evokes these second- and third-order effects (i.e., beyond the first-order effect of affecting the choices of the player whose character has the key), but the rule of thumb that may help is, as you suggest, coming up with indexes of behavior that imply third-party action: you don't need to defend an authority figure who isn't being questioned or criticized by somebody. So if I take Key of Obedience, I'm motivated to defend the questionable authority figures that you as GM are motivated to introduce (the second-order effect, right?). My question is this: it's not clear to me how you see the third-order motivation working (i.e., the motivation of players without the key to question the questionable authority figures). Do they need Key of the Rebel (in which case it's merely a case of complementary first-order motivations allowing cash register-like ka-chinging of XPs) or do you expect that their action is driven by the narratively signaling the sketchiness of the authority figure ("The Supreme Court says that a man who  was sentenced to death can't appeal because he filed his motion after the deadline, even though he met the incorrect deadline he was told by the judge. What do you do?")? But if there's no game-mechanical oomph to the third-order bribe, what's the actual reward? Spotlight time? Social approval? Something else?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77627/#Comment_77627" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T20:12:55+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:12PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill:  The second order effect is, in fact, the other players:  They are motivated to question <b>any</b> authority figure, because it gets you to defend that authority figure.  They're motivated to question authority figures even if the GM presents them as totally unquestionable.  They're motivated to question GOD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey get two rewards:  One, <b>you</b> get XPs, which puts the group as a whole one step above the GM (as is often the competitive model).  Believe you me, I can say from personal experience that a group as a whole garners a lot more XPs off of Keys when they treat it as a group activity.  Second (and more important to my mind) they get your undivided attention the moment they offer you a chance to fulfill your Key.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, yes, they are <i>also</i> motivated to take Keys (like Rebel) that interlock with yours.  It both helps them seek the second-order bribe more easily <i>and</i> means that they've got a Key that you're probably feeding them lots of opportunities for.  Synergy there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe third order effect is the GM.  The GM cannot directly make you defend an authority figure just by introducing a sketchy one.  If nobody's attacking, it doesn't <i>matter</i> how vulnerable the authority figure is to attack.  Unless, of course, you proactively start defending them even before they're attacked, which would be hilarious (and good strategic play!)  But, on the whole, I think that the GM is motivated to introduce questionable authority figures because <i>all the players</i> (you and everyone else) are motivated to interact around them in this particular sequence.  He knows that someone will attack the authority figure, and then you'll defend them, and it'll rock.  Or if he <i>doesn't</i> realize that, he soon learns.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's like setting up a giant pile of fireworks, handing the GM a match and saying "Well, y'know, you don't <b>have to</b> throw that match in the pile ... I'm just saying, here's a big pile of pretty bangs, here's a match.  Do whatever you feel like."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77629/#Comment_77629" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T20:38:32+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:38PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            X &lt;============ Theft of Tony's ideas occurs here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77631/#Comment_77631" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T20:41:05+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:41PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Way ahead of you, Levi.<br><br>I need to find a way of piping TonyLB directly into my designs without the intervention of forum posts.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77700/#Comment_77700" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T00:49:02+00:00" title="June 26, 2007 12:49AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><br>Isn't that neat?

So that instead of the single monolith of "makes excuses for authority figures: 6 pts" you have "submissive to authority: 2pt, make excuses: 2pt, deflect harm from others: 2pts" and making excuses for authority figures is the 6pt Trifecta.  As a bonus you get littler bribes for less specific actions, and different, unpredictable combinations.  <br/><br/>Which maybe solves the balance of freedom/support, but also gives a lot more flexibility in the upper echelons of XP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77940/#Comment_77940" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T16:43:56+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  4:43PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that, Judson.<br/><br/>Tony, I was trying to summarize your point here for my blog and realized that without the example I'm not sure I can do that.
