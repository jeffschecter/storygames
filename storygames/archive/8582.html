In it's normal form, players build up their hero and its allies, and then fight against their opponent's hero and allies; last one standing wins.<br/><br/>However, the raid decks (referenced in the Penny Arcade comic you linked) are a sort of special co-operative multiplayer mode.  One person acquires the non-customizable (as far as I can tell) raid deck, and plays it against a group of players using their normal decks.  The raid deck contains monsters and difficult bosses and so on that amount to a challenge for at least a few players.  It's not necessarily meant to be played in a story game style - Tycho here is taking it to extremes - but there's no reason that it can't be played with some narrative flourishes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190474/#Comment_190474" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T16:51:11+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  4:51PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a couple of times, I had a roommate who was really into it.

Th one raid deck I've seen did have a logical, non-random sequence of 'phases' for the boss to go through, which is the closest to story I've seen in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190497/#Comment_190497" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T23:32:08+00:00" title="January 28, 2009 11:32PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it was summed up well before. WoW plays a little too much like Magic, for my tastes and the raid decks are supposed to be tackled by several players. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I'm reminded of the White Wolf CCG they did for Changling, where you made a board to explore and a character that you built with flaws, equipment and edges. And then there was Wyvern, which actually was kind of an RPG where the GM would play cards that would bring in new effects into the story (ala Once upon a time)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190519/#Comment_190519" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T07:59:07+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  7:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2009 8:02AM by MikeRiverso.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Changeling CCG you're referring to was Arcadia.

It's the same reason no one throws a fit in a game like Descent, where the dungeon master is instructed to KILL the player characters at any and every chance they get within the listed rules. There's no story to be told, no big reason behind it. We know they are out to get us and we have to survive their little sadistic game of cat and mouse, people accept it because it's a card game or a board game where winning is the goal, far different than most RPGs where players are often told "There are no winners or losers. The ride is the destination."<br/><br/>All that's needed to achieve that in a RPG is to notify players ahead of time that once combat hits or dice resolution pops up, it's going to be brutal.<br/>I think there's some card decks made by Paizo that add in new problems to critical hits or other situations which can also help because "Hey, it's in the text on the card, the GM isn't being a jerk."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193159/#Comment_193159" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-18T16:47:50+00:00" title="February 18, 2009  4:47PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Saw this on Penny Arcade today and thought it was worth bumping the thread for: <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/02/18/new-dd-podcast/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/02/18/new-dd-podcast/</a><br/><br/>Basically, one of the guys from PA found WoW TCG Raid decks to be an entryway to tabletop gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
