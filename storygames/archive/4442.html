But it's hard to judge that when you don't know who has what.<br/>2. Several players were confused about their fate and how they might uncover it during play.  So I took they away from the table to give them a few suggestions.

Our superpowers were like enhanced freakery and part of our disguises. For example, my character was Mary Jackson (can't remember her stage name!) a shapeshifting contortionst. Vincent was Edmund the tattooed gentleman and werewolf. Emily was Chintzer, a civilized geek who really could eat crazy stuff (and was also part of the anarchist movement). Meg was Ozcan the human pincushion who was impervious to pain and almost unkillable.<br/><br/>I don't think any PC ever actually killed the Kaiser/Mountain Witch. An NPC, another shapeshifting contortionist killed him IIRC, and took over his identity.<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23392.0" rel="nofollow">Here's the closest thing to an AP</a> that any of us did. It's really more about the characters and players playing them, but you can get a feel for what the game was like, and how we played and revealed our dark fates. <br/>Our dark fates were: <br/>Mary Jackson--Revenge (on Edmund. She was blamed for some murders he'd committed years ago)<br/>Edmund--Worst Fear? In that he really truly was a monster.<br/>Chintzer--In love (with Mary, who loved him back but refused him, because as she put it, she was "poison")<br/>Ozcan--Betrayal. I can't remember what the card really is.

Sure there is a chance that someone MIGHT get the same card but that's okay.  It's better than possibly knowing what someone elses fates are.<br/><br/>I think the GM knowing is a mistake.  I think 1/2 of the GMs job is setting up scenes that illicit the players into revealing their fates.  That's it.  <br/><br/>"You enter a chamber that has a obsidian wall polished to a reflective surface.  What do you see in it?"<br/>"You come to a body hanging from the branch of a high tree.  Who is it?"<br/>"There is a sword plunged into the body.  What does it look like?<br/>"What does the sword whisper to the other ronin?"<br/><br/>This is what this game is made of, in my opinion.  If the players are doing their job then everyone, including the GM should be able to guess what the fates are.<br/><br/>So basically you withold acts until you, as the GM, have figured out (or think you've figured out) what they are.<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
