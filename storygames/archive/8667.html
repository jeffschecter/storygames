Say that we fix the chance of success at <i>whatever</i>. Let's pretend we're playing a game where you roll a six-sider: a 1 is abject failure, 2 is an escalation of failure, 3-4 is a postponement of action, 5 is an escalation of success, and a 6 is complete success.<br/><br/>What slides then is the <i>effect</i>. I don't know how you figure out what the effect for a 6 is fairly, but you can always resort to GM-fiat. <br/><br/>For example, you're negotiating with a guy in a convenient store. He just pulled out a .45 and has it pointed at you and the clerk, and he's waving the pistol back and forth nervously. You want to get out of this alive. So the GM tells you that a 1 means that he gets really mad at you and fires the gun at you (but misses). A 6 means you calm him down and he leaves the store. You roll a 2. Crap! The GM tells you that a 1 now means that he shoots the gun and wounds you. You roll again: a 4. Postponement. You keep role-playing your negotiation, how you're maneuvering, etc. You roll again: a 5. GM says that a success now means you snatch the gun from him! You roll again: a 6! You slide to his side and grab his arm. The gun goes off, blasting a rack full of Slim Jims. You grab the .45 and wave it at the thug, ordering him down on the floor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191833/#Comment_191833" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T08:25:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  8:25AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poor Slim Jims.

I want my character's broad intent in the scene to be realized between 1 in 6 and 5 in 6 times.<br/><br/>I'd agree that "needing that 20" (5% success rate) to take out the zombie hulk before it severs the rope bridge can be a very satisfying setup.<br/><br/>Hitting (task resolution) in 4E hovers around 55-60%.  This is well within my preferred zone of 16.67% to 83.33% and yet I'd probably agree that 4E is whiffier than I'd like.<br/><br/>BUT most 4E combat encounters are actually a success for the PCs much greater than 83.33% of the time (I'd guess no worse than 98% of the time in most groups) WHERE success is defined as "we killed all of them" versus "they killed most or all of us and now we have to make new characters."  That's why I have a strong preference in games like 4E for encounters where that is not the primary or only goal.  It is the encounter goal of "save all the innocents from fiery death," or "hold the bridge for ten combat rounds," or "impress the village elders sufficiently than they name you their protectors." that I want to 1) be present and 2) succeed at no worse than 1 in 6 times and no better than 5 in 6 times.<br/><br/>In my last 4E session (as a player) I prevented the stirge-spooked horses from sending the caravan wagon and its NPC passengers over a cliff.  I'd guess my odds at that were about 1 in 3; it was very satisfying success and drove some colorful post-encounter story elements.  The PCs had a 99.99% chance of beating the Stirges.  That part was fun but less interesting to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191882/#Comment_191882" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T11:25:01+00:00" title="February 10, 2009 11:25AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Related anecdote.<br/><br/>I played a bad session of The Shadow Of Yesterday (which isn't anything against the <i>system</i>, you understand, as I'll explain shortly).<br/><br/>Nothing my character did seemed to matter.

I love being surprised, but in the best possible way, not the second best possible way.<br/><br/>Not that I don't get the thrill of a dice roll.  Hail Marys can be awesome even when they fail, if there's heart-pounding followed by a collective "AARRRrrrggh!!"  But honestly, at such times I wish I were playing with the ideal illusionist, who could pull off an authentic thrill even while fudging the roll the right way.  I mean, if success would have been even <i>more</i> awesome, then why allow the chance for failure, even if it's only a smidge less cool?  The thrill of uncertainty is the only reason.  So as long as we're talking preferences, I prefer to have my cake and eat it too.  How to achieve that ideal will probably plague me for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>Also, the thrill of uncertainty doesn't need to come from success vs. failure.  Some of my favorite dice rolls have been times when I <i>knew</i> "This is going to be <i>so</i> good" or "This is going to be <i>so</i> bad".  Success or failure was pretty much assured (at least in my own mind), but the <i>degree</i> of success or failure was not.  I think this may have increased tension in that I knew the GM wouldn't be dividing his attention between coming up with a jaw-dropping success and a jaw-dropping failure; he'd be focused completely on one or the other.  In terms of probability, I suppose I felt like it was between 40/60 and 60/40 between a plausible degree and an <i>extreme</i> degree (partly depending on how the GM treated the other players).  This type of roll was fairly rare in my group, so maybe they would have been less magical if they were more common.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
