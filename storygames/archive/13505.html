What will happen when these players start designing on their own?</blockquote>\nI don't think anything different from what is happening now will happen. And right now a constant expansion and maturation is what I witness happening.\n<blockquote>- Will they outgrow us?</blockquote>\nI certainly hope so. Players with no brain damage are achingly cute. On my modest part, I contributed to the spreading of the hobby with two or three people.\n<blockquote>- Will we all be left on the scrapheap of history?</blockquote>\nSeriously, is that a facetious question or you really want an answer? Mine can only be a question: why should one think that?\n<blockquote>- Will our games be left for broken, or insufficient to tell the really good stories?</blockquote>\nDon't think so. They may be improved and evolve. Trollbabe did, for instance. But if the premise is valid, I don't see why a game should cease to be a good game.\n<blockquote>- What flaws in our design will be revealed by time, and by their superior understanding of the medium?</blockquote>\nWell that is truly one question to which, by its formulation, nobody can possibly answer without taking a guess so wild it doesn't make much sense to take it. In short: only time will tell.\n<blockquote>I don't know anything about these long-term effects of our games. I can't even begin to guess. Would you dare to hazard a guess?</blockquote>\nThere are games which are inspired by other games, often. And they become great games by themselves. I'm thinking of what games Trollbabe and My Life With Master inspired, and they're all bloody masterpieces. I think that's the first and most widespread evolution pattern that can be witnessed.<br/>The second pattern is way more uncommon, and it only happens with frikkin' geniuses, who create games that are both cool and completely new. <br/>The second pattern then becomes inevitably source for the first pattern: genial games spur the creativity of people and inspire the creation of other games. <br/>I think this interaction of patterns will continue, at least for some time. <br/>So what should slow down an escalating growth in novelty, quality and beauty of games?<br/>The fact that the game designing trend expands quickly. Which has a downside. Basically, many people start designing games just because they can. Here in Italy, I see people creating hacks upon hacks without even trying and playing the original game first, just to make an example of what I mean. It's an expanding trend which has some damaging potential to the hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304947/#Comment_304947" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T01:40:56+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  1:40AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Will they outgrow us?</i><br/><br/>Definitely.<br/><br/><i>Will we all be left on the scrapheap of history?</i><br/><br/>Mostly.<br/><br/><i>Will our games be left for broken, or insufficient to tell the really good stories?<br/>- What flaws in our design will be revealed by time, and by their superior understanding of the medium?</i><br/><br/>They won't understand the medium better: just differently.

In a real way, this seems to be richest vein of potential art within our media.<br/><br/>We need to take deep journeys into how we interact with media (from game text to fora to podcasts) and use this to exponentially enhance the reliability of our play experiences. The game text has always been a compromise between what is possible and helpful for play, it may very well need to die so that the games might live.<br/><br/>We need to embrace the fact that play causes learning, and that as designers and players we have a responsibility to understand how that affects our ideas and perceptions (ideally before the next "brain damage" kerfluffle). It would be far better if we could actually do something positive here, but even some damage control would be nice. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304960/#Comment_304960" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T05:02:48+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  5:02AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>What kind of stories do you think<i>future players</i>(tm) will want to play?</blockquote>\nIf I knew, I'd be playing them already.<br/><br/>(With apologies to Humphrey Lyttelton.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304963/#Comment_304963" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T06:53:26+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  6:53AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- Will we all be left on the scrapheap of history?</blockquote>\nI think for every innovation in gaming there will be the game that did it first, the immitators and incremental improvers, and the the game that did it the cleanest.

No sweat. <br/><br/>But there will follow an insight, right behind it, telling humans that the virtuality is still virtually nothing, compared to reality. And players of the future will realize that the reality and creativity of a'capella gaming is far superior to anything you may effectualize virtually. The human spirit will drown in your brave new world, mister Accounting, but it will raise and free itself again! ;-)<br/><br/>I do not predict an end to WoW; there will certainly be a lot of electronica in <i>gaming</i>. But I foresee a better future for our kind of games, and more popularity due to them being an alternative for those fed up with screen-play.

I've been talking a lot to the younger 20s gamers (one of whom is my housemate), and trying to get a new group together that is easier for me to game with (since my normal group is 20 miles away). But they seem to be uninterested in anything aside from D&amp;D 4E. When I asked if there were other games they might try, some couldn't even NAME other games. My housemate, for instance, while still relatively new to gaming (four years of experience), has never heard of classics like Paranoia or GURPS (which...seems improbable), and didn't want to play a game that meant she had to "role-play."<br/>...and I just stared at her in slack-jawed shock. I mean, I understand that some people just want the hack n' slash. That's been an inherent part of the hobby since its birth. But the character she's working on for a new campaign right now is a Bard. How can you play a Bard and not "role-play"? I tried to explain to her how some games let you earn experience from exploring more about your character and building relationships with other PCs and NPCs, as much as killing monsters. And her response was, to paraphrase, "Where's the fun in that?"<br/>Her friends were much the same way...to the extent that I've given up for the time-being on trying to get a new group together.<br/><br/>I just...don't get it anymore. Maybe I'm just feeling frustrated from months of not being able to game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305594/#Comment_305594" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T13:28:47+00:00" title="December 22, 2010  1:28PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There have always been people like that, Michael, they are just as numerous in every generation and in every time and place. 80-90 percent of the hobby plays The Current Version Of D&amp;D, and never plays anything else, and there is no reason to believe that number will ever change in the future.

Really, i'm serious. it's perfect and beautiful.<br/><br/>Anyway, i totally agree with it. i haven't had a regular group in something like 2 years, and it's excruciating.<br/><br/>As for the new generation... i don't really know, i don't think they will be as different from story gaming as story gaming is different from D&amp;D: a huge leap has been made in conceptualizing the structure of the hobby, in thinking about tools and dynamics, and this was probably the biggest break between trad and story gaming*: such a "paradigm shift" is not needed anymore, and i think new generations of gaming will keep on expanding, in different directions. Most probably, GNS/Big Model will lose its "hegemony": as for now, it's more or less the only model of roleplaying theory, and, as such, it is <b>the</b> model, probably the future will see different models rising, some competitive, some complementary, and this will obviously generate a lot of games geared to get specific results and to reproduce specific dynamics, which we may actually not even notice, right now.<br/><br/>This IS far-fetched, maybe, but i sure hope it happens: as valid as i think the GNS is, it is a model, and, as such, a simplified vision of reality. many social sciences show, in their academic history, that teh development of more, diverse models brings to a richer, healthier approach to the matter, while a single dominant model makes for a rigid discipline and constraints the possible evolutions. <br/><br/>*even though i'm still totally convinced that there is no "us" and "them": it's  two sides of the same coin, and more often than not there will be some powerful similarities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305677/#Comment_305677" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T07:09:02+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  7:09AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thinkthe next generation of designer will re-examine why those early ad-hoc/toolkit games worked, and will build dirty-hippy toolbox games instead of the laser focussed dirty-hippy games we see now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
