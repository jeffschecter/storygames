The original book was a hardback but was certainly not thick.  I don't know the exact page count, perhaps 128, but quite large text and lots of pictures. Not what I would consider a lot of material.  The most recent edition, Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition, is even smaller.  A very tight little game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess with some restricted arrangement of edges you could make some rough approximations of roles, but ultimately it really wouldn't work.  Savage Worlds Tactics are pretty simple (ganging up, taunting, using edges, ranged vs. close combat) and do a pretty good job of letting the players come up with in-game tactical choices that give rise to rich combats.  My sense of 4e is that the tactics exist only because the ruleset for them exists and it is a much bigger ruleset.  Furthermore, Savage Worlds doesn't have classes and races come with pretty minimal differences (basically some bonuses here and there, nothing specifically tactical).  4e has significant tactical differences between classes already built in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to a general comment, I'd say play 4e if you want to play 4e.  What I mean is that the ruleset seems to have been screwed down quite tightly on playing in that implied setting, using those pre-defined classes, creating tactics based on pre-defined powers within a universe of specific combat rules.  I haven't had a chance to play it yet (but I will be next weekend at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.draconismontreal.ca/index.php" rel="nofollow">Draconis</a>with <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://chattydm.net/" rel="nofollow">ChattyDm</a>, so I'm quite psyched) so I could be off here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSavage Worlds is still a pretty traditional RPG, but it's much more flexible (thus the wealth of settings for it, both commercial and amateur).  I find it gives the players (or me as a player) a good amount of tactical freedom in combat.  It has some fun, gamey elements as well (cards for initiative, wild dice, exploding dice) that keep the game exciting and dynamic around the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the question that arises for me is why would you want to have roles in Savage Worlds?  My sense of them is that they were created to impose a kind of spotlight balance on 4e, something that seems unnecessary for the people I play with (we generally work it out amongst ourselves who is going to do what in combat, though roleplaying usually comes in and messes all that up <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>) and thus overly restrictive for our group.  Furthermore, combat in Savage Worlds is really quite dynamic, especially with the changing of the initiative order each round, so that you never seem to get stuck in a situation where your PC has nothing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM Prep in Savage Worlds is the fastest prep/crunch ratio I've ever used.  As far as fun for the players, it's my go-to system for any game that wants cinematic action \xe0 la Die Hard and it has slowly infected the rest of the community here in Montreal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236543/#Comment_236543" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T07:40:11+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  7:40AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stou'n</cite>Andy, which version of SW were you playing?

That sounds tough.  What is league-style exactly?  Are the players or groups competitive with each other?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with replacing 4e with something else is that, as I said, 4e is 4e and if that's the kind of game your players want to play (rather than say, play in a game that takes place in a cool fantasy world where they get to do cool stuff and find a system that works for everybody), I don't know if they'll be super happy with a new system being imposed on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you do want to transition to something, Savage Worlds is probably a good choice.  I know it was played in the WotC offices while they were designing 4e with quite a good response.  There is also a Fantasy Companion for SW that does a lot of the work for you to run any vanilla fantasy using SW.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut be aware that they are ultimately very different beasts.  But I suspect that most games are different beasts than 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236705/#Comment_236705" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T14:57:45+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  2:57PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Long ago, I wrote a little X-Crawl inspired thing for Savage Worlds.

I want to get that stuff right.<br><br>But I also hate the little delays that happen when a GM is setting up, so I try to do stuff in advance to keep the flow.  <br><br>So to answer your question, I make the encounter envelopes with:<br>3 or so map pages (at least 1 drawn already, the other 2 gridded)<br>Some kind of reference for terrain features<br/>Initiative cards for each monster type (that I made and cut out)<br/>Printed out statblocks for each monster (that I cut out)<br/>Printed out cards with treasure for the encounter<br/>The tokens for the monsters<br/>Cards with the status effects relevant to the encounter to hand to players when they get tagged with them<br/>A card that lists monster types and defenses so the players don't have to tell me they hit<br/><br/>All of that is of course contingent on writing a good encounter to begin with, with sufficiently interesting terrain (long grass, poisoned ponds, big boulders to stand on, etc.)<br/><br/>I missed a few of those elements in the encounters that we did last time we played at Ryerson, and I definitely felt they were missing.  When I started Tag's Folly I thought I'd be able to do most of the prep during my 10 hours a week spent on the train, but assembling those envelopes means I need to be at home with all the stuff I bought, so it eats into my very premium home time.  <br/><br/>I've been near to burning out because I have so much on (4 game groups, huge project at work, lots of family needs especially with my daughter turning 2) and the prepping those things to do gamist 4e "right" really feels like a chore.  <br/><br/>None of which is to say that a switch to Savage Worlds is really on the menu, I think I was just feeling down about the 4e game and grasping at straws.  I was really bummed before last nights game but it went really well, so don't worry - I'm not in danger of imminently cancelling Tag's Folly or anything.  I just have to get the prep down to something that's manageable in my very busy life.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236845/#Comment_236845" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-10T22:49:15+00:00" title="October 10, 2009 10:49PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 10, 2009 10:59PM by Dave L.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice is to write up a basic idea of the encounter area: "Scurvs are hiding in the undergrowth, with a pair of hot roaches.  There's a winding path up to the temple, and off to the sides of it we have difficult terrain."<br/>\n<br/>\nThen draw out the encounter area when the PCs engage it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that printing stuff shouldn't take too long, since you know what you want to print out already (that can be done on the train), and they can be recycled.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The most prep I have is deciding what the hell the NPCs are up to, who they are, and - if I am into it - trying to make a balanced encounter.

It means that I have to fully embrace the viking hat, but that's okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last game I ran the PCs went into a dungeon; I was planning on drawing it up, but never did - on purpose.  The simple flowchart that I had in mind - yeah, just in mind, not written up - worked just as well as a fully statted dungeon.  That's not to say that I would shift monsters around based on how well the PCs were doing at the time, I just didn't feel like I had to stat up the encounter rooms fully.  I realized that my role as DM was to provide consistency in order to make sure the players can make real decisions, but I didn't need to stat everything out fully in order to do that as long as I was being fair.)<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: I think in the type of game that you're running you don't have to worry as much about having a "level x encounter".  The way that I understand the game is that there are threats out there and they are based on the setting, not on the level of the party.  That means that it's easier on you, as DM, to detail encounters, because all you have to do is ask yourself, "What would be here?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236853/#Comment_236853" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-11T04:31:38+00:00" title="October 11, 2009  4:31AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SW is much, much easier to prep, much easier to run.

It is the one stat if it is too high, combat can really drag with lots of misses and bounce off ofs\n<blockquote>Savage Worlds Tactics are pretty simple (ganging up, taunting, using edges, ranged vs. close combat)<br/></blockquote>\nSimple, but not simplistic, especially when factoring the simple rules of Tricks and Taunts, which can cover a WIDE array of combat manuevers that don't necessarily translate into inflicting damage on the other guy.  One player had his PC throw his just-picked manacles at evil wizard guards to delay them on the stairs.  Very easily addressed by a Trick.

What is taking you so long?  I usually just cut 'n paste 'n upgrade stat blocks and let the players construct the encounter map (given a few constraints by me).

My 4E prep time is very low. The only thing that takes any time is thinking of what the possible story elements will contain.  And I am really playing it. I am not handwaving anything (although I am applying fullbore storygame techniques to skill challenges, I still pre-plan them with "approved" skills and complexity ratings).  <br/><br/>It takes me about a half hour to an hour, though this does not including cutting and pasting monster images to make my custom tokens (I'm starting to get lazy here and recycling more generic tokens). I also do not print out treasure ahead of time (now that WotC has cut PDFs, I have no good way to print these out), in fact as of last session, I'm letting the players do all that work. Last session I just gave them the parcels to choose from. Going forward I'm just giving them lumps of gold, already divided per player, that they use to spend on any magic items or rituals they want and they decide how they got the items.<br/><br/>I use a battle map and draw it out.  I have a pre-printed stack of status effects that works for all encounters (one says "I am Dazed" and lists the effects, for example) and use little post-it flags to mark tokens. A lot of your prep is not going to be fixed by SW, and looks to be entirely things you are taking upon yourself to present things in a nicer package. D&amp;D certainly allows for that, but it's not required.<br/><br/>I imagine SW might be possible to play on the fly with little to no mechanical prep, and doing that would have it win out over 4E. But, I'm not a big fan of SW, I'd rather use HeroQuest or SotC (or other Fate 3.0) when I want a lighter system that I can improvise everything with. But, I'm playing 4E specifically for the niche protection and more detailed combat fun that I can't get with the other systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
