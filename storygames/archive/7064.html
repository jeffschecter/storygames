Along the way, interspersed with monologues by the guy they're waiting for, they talk about games, rpging in general, their lives, even (gasp!) their wives and girlfriends. The show, in the end, was a light meditation on why the hecuba adults still spend so much time playing what the vast majority considers to be a childish and silly game. It premiered at the Minnesota Fringe Festival and did extremely well, selling out three of the five shows, and we had a blast doing it.<br/><br/>Coming up on a year ago, Bill set the film version in motion. It wasn't easy, but it got done, and premiered at CONvergence over the Fourth of July weekend. I couldn't be there (I was in South Dakota on a family vacation), but it did well again, selling almost 100 pre-final-cut dvd copies, and was chosen to be shown again at the con after-party. <br/><br/>Final cut copies with lots of extras, including a "wives and girlfriends" commentary track, will be available soon, maybe in a month or two. For now, there's a blog with a trailer: <br/><br/><a href="http://thacothemovie.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">THAC0: The Movie</a><br/><br/>(Bill used our real names, so I'm the Aaron they're wating for... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )<br/><br/>I'm pretty proud of this, and I you'll all like it, too. Enjoy!<br/><br/>Oh, and if you live in or around Minneapolis, there's a screening happening at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul tomorrow night (Friday). If you're interested in going, pm me and I'll get you the relevant details.<br/><br/>Finally, this is certainly shameless, but it features a cameo by Neil Gaiman. Yup, <i>that</i> Neil Gaiman.<br/><br/>Aaron                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157380/#Comment_157380" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-18T11:02:42+00:00" title="July 18, 2008 11:02AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must vouch for the awesomeness of THAC0.
