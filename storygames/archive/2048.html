                    Rather than Hijack the De-geekifying Gaming thread, I thought I'd just start my own.<br/><br/>There's been alot of talk lately about the 'shame of gaming', of being 'outed' on gaming and such geek-awkward admittals of trying to 'not look like a loser' by attempting to main-stream gaming and several variations of spin-off dilemna's about the cool/geek factor of one type of gaming to another.<br/><br/>I've just got one question...okay, maybe a few.<br/><br/>What's wrong with being a geek?<br/>Why did we have more than fifty posts talking about how to make gaming less geeky to the average person?<br/><br/>It's my opinion that the very people who get embarrassed about gaming are the ones encouraging the stereotype in the first place....So, if you want it to stop, start with yourself!   Be pro-active!<br/><br/>So...you game.   Sure, some people might give you funny looks, and not get it...but it depends on your attitude as well!   <b>If you say it like you're embarrassed, then you deserve to be. </b> If you love gaming, have an intense interest in mechanics, or just love being creative or escaping reality for a couple hours, then so what?   Someone might make fun of you for it?  Someone might look at you funny?  Someone might call you a geek?<br/><br/>...Bah!   I'm proud to be a geek...and you know what?  I'm not embarrassed to say so to someone in public...Hell, I'll break my d20's out of my purse and crack a joke if it comes down to it.    I don't think it's anymore a 'waste of time' or 'pointless' or "lame'  anymore than someone dropping $80.00 to sit at a bar and drink for no reason other than to sit at a bar and drink.    It's a matter of perception, and what people do to encourage them.   You'd be suprised how many people actually just think it's pretty neat, and sounds like fun.<br/><br/>You want to make more gaming seem less geeky to outsiders?   Then don't act as if it's something to be embarrassed about in the first place.<br/><br/>Because honestly?  What's wrong with being a geek?<br/><br/>...Where I come from, dorks are to cute as geek is to cool.<br/><br/>Or maybe that's just my take on it, and I don't bother to let anyone rain on my parade.   <br/>Maybe that's the real problem; not enough people comfortable with how they think others see them.<br/><br/>So, all and all?...Don't de-geek my gaming.   I don't need it de-geeked at all...and I'm just fine with it the way it is.<br/><br/><b>(edited to add the following, as I didn't realize I had forgotten to paste it on and without it, this first post makes alot less sense!  Sorry to post only half-It's Monday!)</b><br/><br/>And in conclusion to the glorification of Geekhood, There's only one question left.<br/>To Geek, or not to geek?<br/><br/>-what, and why- do you feel gaming is exclusive to non-gamers?   there's alot of excitement about how to include non-gamers, but I'm not nessisarily certain I agree with why they are excluded.  I don't think it has to do with complicated game matter, dice rolling, intricate systems or understanding the concept; I think it has to do with the attitude of "I'm not going to bother explaining this because you'll think it's stupid", from the gamer that causes the "but you'll think I'm stupid because I'm not a gamer...so I won't ask"   I don't see that part being asked; and I'm interested in knowing why.                </div>

                            Sara, I think that you're covering a lot of material that was already covered in the other threads - my responses were very similar, to say the least.<br/><br/>I'm going to say one thing though: roleplaying has been traditionally marginalized and looked down on.  BADD, geek culture, and the stereotyping of a d&amp;d player all pushed roleplayers into feelings of shame and awkwardness about their hobby. Not to victimize them, but there were a lot of things which led to gamers feeling ashamed of what they were doing.<br/><br/>And the threads you mention were not about self-victimization, or dwelling on that, or complaining, but finding ways to move past that, figuring out how to safely let people in on this part of your identity, and learning to claim this as part of your identity. The need to feel safe disclosing information about yourself is a universal thing, not specific to gamers.<br/><br/>An internal culture of shame, coupled with a need for safety when approaching others, makes a lot of people just keep gaming <i>to themselves</i>. I think the issue is to figure out how to collectively and individually move past that.                        </div>

                            Well, for me, it's pretty simple:  If gaming is something that, systematically, requires social sacrifices that <b>only make sense</b> to somebody who is totally obsessed with it, to the exclusion of other social activities, then it's harder for me to recruit new people to gaming.<br/>
<br/>
If people, for instance, <i>accept</i> that they'll have to sit quietly and do nothing for two hours of a four hour session ... dude.  That eliminates almost everyone I know except roleplaying addicts.  Because everybody else is going to look at that and say "The hell?  Why would I sit through that stuff if it's boring?  I can play monopoly and be entertained four hours out of four hours."<br/>
<br/>
Similarly:  Meeting every week for the indefinite future, memorizing book upon book of rules, interrupting the game at random intervals for Monty Python quote-fests ... these are all things that RPG players put up with, in order to be RPGing.  For the sake of the people who get excluded from enjoying the games by all those little rituals, I'd aim toward excising them and leaving only the fun.<br/>
<br/>
And that's what I lurk in de-geeking threads to find.                        </div>

Larry beat me to the punch. Sara, do you realize that someone who does not identify as a geek, nor is proud of being one, could read your post as a call that one really should be a geek and all the bad stuff in their hobby would go away? That is, as Larry points out, pretty exclusionary, and pretty short-sighted. <br/><br/>There are a wide range of problems in this sub-culture that will not go away so long as the generally accepted conclusion is to just "stop being ashamed." Worse, those problems will likely go ignored at best. At worst, people who bring up those problems will be dismissed for going against the social flow.<br/><br/>Larry, thank you for posting that comment. Tony, your post was also excellent.                        </div>

                            I didn't post on the de-geekify thread because my statement wasn't really about how to make gaming more relateable; and I didn't want to drag the thread away from that; it's a great topic and I agree with many of the things said; which is why I don't feel I have to add anything to it.<br/><br/>Secondly; It's not a cry for everyone to do some self-affirmation as much as it is to state that maybe we should remember that some of the geekier aspects of gaming in the first place can actually be an attraction.   I do feel after reading some of the other threads that the other side of 'geek' should be examined; that it's not nessisarily the details that turn people off from gaming, but the attitude that some gamers have towards those who don't know about gaming.  (also covered in a thread, but again, the thread was exploring a specific, and I wouldn't want to hijack that either!)<br/><br/>My thoughts are:<br/>We shouldn't assume that it's de-geeking that will make it more accepted; but perhaps it's that we need to de-elitist.   Attitude has alot more to do with how we're percieved, and I'm not sure about everyone else, but I've had more than a fair share of being talked down to by gamers who think that because someone hasnt' played, that they 'just won't get it'.    -This is similar to something already said by Tony, but I'm trying to voice the other side of it-  It works both ways.<br/><br/>Do outsiders not ask about gaming because they feel it's exclusive, or do we assume that if they actually were interested, that they'd get involved?   What comes first?  Chicken or Egg?    <br/><br/>Is it the geek part of games that excludes, or is it our own assumptions?<br/><br/>I'm more interested in hearing thoughts about WHY people feel gaming is exclusive, rather than ways to make it more attractive to non-gamers.  <br/>(if there is a post on this question somewhere, I did look before posting this thread, but didn't find one)                        </div>

                            As an afterthought, I really should add the following.<br/><br/>For all my rants of geekhood, I still consider myself on that outsider edge of gaming; which is maybe where I draw some of my conclusions from.  It's my recent glimpse into the gamer side of things that I'm starting to view most of the barriers of gaming as a self-inclicted gunshot.<br/><br/>To answer my own question that I asked?   I think non-gamers who do want to game get frustrated and turned away by the attitude of individuals, not because of gaming aspects.   I don't think the biggest problem is the 'geek' factor scaring people away, but that it's more of the 'you're not cool enough since you don't know about this already' factor.

                            Here's a couple of points --<br/><br/>I want geeky gamers and I want non-geeky gamers.  Just like there are, say, movie geeks and also a lot of people who watch movies who *aren't* movie geeks.  I don't think that there's anything wrong with geeks (heck, I wrote a game specifically for them!) but I think it's useful for my own personal profit and for the overall health of the sub-culture to have a greater degree of accessibility to non-geeky participants than we do presently.<br/><br/>I'm using "geek" in this context to describe "someone who is really heavily committed to one activity, to the extent of knowing lots of trivia about it and having it form a core part of their identity.  In the other context -- people who are into books and computers and stuff -- it's totally silly to try to avoid geekiness, given that it is at this point (post 90s) the mainstream of world-wide popular culture.<br/><br/>A second point is that geeky activity is a very different thing for men and women in our culture.  I think I'm just going to let that hang there and have people make their own points about it -- my own particular perception of the divide doesn't matter so much as the fact that the divide exists.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

Well, I'm all for non-geeky games, but I don't see that there is any shame in a game being geeky, and appealing to an audience of geeks.  I approve of non-geeky games on the basis of variety being more interesting, but that doesn't mean there is something wrong with geeky games.  <br/><br/>What exactly is the source of shame here?  If I'm not ashamed of being a geek, I don't see why I should be ashamed of sharing geeky activities with other geeks.  Similarly, if I host a caroling party, I am being exclusionary to non-singers.  It's not like non-geeks are an oppressed class whom I should feel obliged to provide additional outlets for.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bent</cite>I guess my question to you, Sara, is what you think 'geek' means? Or what does it mean to be 'geeky'? You see it as a quality while others it as something derogatory.</blockquote>
Yes, I do see it as a quality and it's one of the things I'm trying to point out. (and I'm not the only one to think it's not nessisarily a bad thing)<br/><br/>People put adjectives to things; sometimes they are meant in a good way, sometimes they are meant in a bad way.   I don't think there is anything that is going to stop this, so I can't help but think that the entire attempt to distance the word geek from gaming is a waste of time.    Just like weird al yankavich embraced nerdiness, some gamers are actually proud of the 'geek' quality of gaming.<br/><br/>The arguement about monopoly and trivia pursuit makes an assumption that those games are okay and not 'geeky' for people to play; but what exactly is this based on?   Most people I know still consider it geeky.   If someone doesn't like games, then they aren't going to like games and there's going to be very little you can do to convince them otherwise.   The same with if they think battleship is for kids or football is for jocks.<br/><br/>To argue of how to make it more assessiable is in part keeps seeming to stem on how to make people not think gamers are some circle of geeks who are socially uncouth because they game.    It's argued on how to make RPG gaming more like board games so that bridges can be crossed; but to argue of those ways, seems to assume that what is lacking, is 'making it more maintream.<br/><br/>My arguement is that while that may be true in some part, I think most of it has to do the idea of not wanting to accept that some people are just going to think gamers are geeks, which makes it all about how to be 'not a geek' to them and show them how great gaming can be.<br/><br/>So that brings me back to the question.    Is that really the case, or do gamers in general tend to just accept that people think gamers are all a bunch of geeks (in a negative way) and have no interest in gaming?  <br/><br/>Why not consider there are lots of people who are are interested but are made to feel like they aren't allowed to become 'geek' enough. (by gamers)<br/>Why not consider that some people want to be 'that geek' and see it as awesome, but are made to feel they are stupid for wanting to be?  (by gamers)<br/><br/>Who's to say that it's not those things that has non-gamers keeping a distance?<br/><br/>After all...what's worse than thinking something is cool, only to have the person involved in that 'cool' to implicate that you're a retard for wanting to get involved?   <br/><br/>My statement is that maybe it's the view that needs to be changed.<br/><br/>Why do some gamers assume : "If I tell them, they're going to just think I'm a geek with no life."<br/>when there's plenty of times when the person asking is thinking "I just want to know more because it sounds really neat...but they are looking at me like I'm retarded for not knowing already"<br/><br/>If this doesnt' make sense, tell me!    Sometimes I think things better in my head than I can manage to explain verbally.                        </div>

                            Jeff has a point there, Sara. A good definition of "Geek" is a person who, due to feelings of inadequacy in comparison to the general populace (possibly because of actual rejection by said populace), applies themselves to rarified fields in which they can excel, in order to reclaim some semblance of self-esteem, often by lording thier understanding of the subject matter over others who also apply to said field.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, let's talk brass tacs here, let's look at Star Wars collectible figures (which I select because it's the highlighted hobby of the 40 year old virgin). Are they fun? Sure. I happen to know that one of the most prized SW fig in any collector's edition is the early Jabba the Hut figure from the cut original footage from episode 4 (where he's a biped alien, not some slug). Yep, that's pretty damn specialized knowledge that really has no application to anything outside of, well, collecting Star Wars figures.<br/>
<br/>
And that's the point. That's what geeky is. If I said to you, "Hey, check it out, there's this frombitz that I know a lot about, and I'm cool because I know a lot about it..." If you don't know anything about it, that makes me look pretty pathetic, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Geeky isn't knowing that Jabba is a rare fig: I'm not a geek. Geeky is going around trying to show off your Jabba fig so that other people think that you're cool. The only possible people who might admire you (and it's not really likely) will be other people who have bought into that area of geekdom, who suffer from the same problem of trying to support their self-esteem on vapor.<br/>
<br/>
Now, geeky to you could mean something else. Fine. But I think that we're all meaning the same thing. When geeky means acting dorky like the Jabba fig example, that's bad. When it means knowing specialized knowledge, that's a fine thing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's the point. Some RPGs require a geek-level buy in. They are organized such that only people who would be relying on a social structure that involves knowing lots of geek knowledge to be at all positively reinforcing would be at all likely to participate. Any "normal" person looking at that situation, <i>even if no geeks are present</i>, is going to see it as a geeky passtime, and not understand the worth of it.<br/>
<br/>
In point of fact, they do. This is not speculative, but many people here can recount the many numbers of times that RPGs have been criticized. There's a man who was on trial for murdering somebody recently who did so with a katana, because the victim was chiding him for playing RPGs and video games. Now the man is known to be unstable. But it doesn't take much imagination to hear in my head what the people who were chiding him sounded like.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you're saying to us, "Well, just ignore those buffoons." And we're saying, "but what if we want to play with those buffoons, because they're friends of ours?" And you say, "Well just present yourself well!" And we say, "We do, we're not geeks, remember? But they still say no, because they think it's geeky."<br/>
<br/>
And you say? Let me guess, "Well, they're not worth playing with, then." Wheras we say, "Hmm, maybe if I made the game a bit more accessible, maybe they wouldn't see it as being so geeky."<br/>

That's a point of view and no one will have the same answer.

This is exactly what I'm argueing against.  (stating that it's often a misconception that gamers have)<br><br>more so, this part.

Why?   I just don't agree with the statement, because it assuming that anyone who doesn't already game won't have an interest in something they don't understand yet.  You don't have to understand something to be interested in it...but if you don't HAVE interest in it, then chances are that it's going to be a long-winded arguement to convince you otherwise.   <br><br>I'm just saying, be careful not to clump non-gamers all into a pile that assumes they dont' game because they think it's geeky.<br><br>Some simply don't know how to convince those "gamer-geeks" to teach us how to be one too.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

What if you don't want to become a gamer-geek, but still want to game? Must one do one to perform the other? Because that's what it seems like you're suggesting. <br><br>But, more importantly, it seems like we're griping about two different things. They are: <br><br>ME: Can we have role-playing the activity be removed from the sub-culture sometimes, please?<br><br>YOU: Can those dysfunctional jerks stop acting like people aren't smart enough to fit in to the sub-culture, please? <br><br>Which, you know, I"m all for.

Actually, I didn't say that at all...and I've repeated the difference a few times now.  <br><br/>Your arguements are stemming from those non-gamers who think gaming is geeky.<br/><br/>My arguements are not about those gamers, (and this is why this is not in THAT thread), My arguement is asking why assume that just because someone doesn't game, that they think it's too geeky and apply it to the general non-gamer base in the first place?   Are we so 'ashamed' of being geeky to that portion of the base who thinks we're geek's, that gamers get in the habit of treating all non-gamers in that way?                        </br></div>

Mike, I said this a few posts up already, but I'll re-state it, so I can make sure I'm making my point more tangible.<br/><br/>First, I am not saying those people don't exist but there is already a thread that talks about different ways to 'convert' those types into gaming.   The things I'm arguing have nothing to do with converting people who look down on gaming.  my statements are based more with saying that gamers dont' have to share that point of view just because they do and that acting like it IS something to be ashamed of is just telling those groups that "Yeah, you're right, we're just geeks...but I can be cool like you"   And that to me, just seems kinda silly.  (I'm not saying it can't be done, but I prefer to spend my time teaching gaming to people who want to game..and have long since given up on trying to convert my friends who actively just dont' care about it)<br/><br/>So, the big question here...I repeat, is that your statements continue to assert that all non-gamers feel gaming is geeky.<br/><br/>What I keep repeating is it isn't always the case.                        </div>

                            I don't have a lot to add to this thread.  But to me, any discussion of geekiness also has to end up discussing (teenage stereotypes about) sexuality.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, hobbies which impress the hell out of the desired sex: not geeky.  Hobbies which, all things being equal, repel the desired sex: geeky.  (Yes, this is juvenile.  But the whole idea of geekiness is a junior high school sort of thing.)<br/>
<br/>
It would stand to reason that...<br/>
* The signifiers of geekiness vary from generation to generation.  We're witnessing one of those shifts now, as pop culture mines 1980's geek activities for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
* Once people outgrow most of their junior high school emotional baggage, geeks seem like kinda cool people you never got to know before.  Hence, geek-chic now that we're all mid-20's and older.<br/>
<br/>
* The signifiers of geekiness, and how they're interpreted, probably vary by gender.<br/>
<br/>
* Like most things related to sexuality, self-confidence is important: it's only an obstacle if you turn it into one.  But sometimes that's easier said than done.<br/>
<br/>
* Games that attract people of the desired sex, are less geeky than games which do not.<br/>
<br/>
I'm kind of leery about making this post.  It's stuff I haven't seen posted elsewhere in these threads, but I don't know whether that's because it's taboo to talk about it, or that I'm some kind of sick weirdo.  (Maybe it's both!)  I'm <i>definitely</i> overstating the case here!  But I do think it's an important aspect to the conversation.  Even those of us with very happy love lives probably had some degree of this growing up.                        </div>

Woot, there we go!     And that's part of what I was trying to say.    While some might not want to game because it's "geeky", there are those who want to game for the SAME reason the other person doesn't want to.    I don't think that should be forgotten, and if we start sharing the mind-set that those who think gaming is "Geeky" (in a bad way), then all we are going to do is create even more people who feel like they'll be considered stupid/uncool for wanting to game...because we'll just become one more person enforcing the stereotype that there is something to be ashamed of.                        </div>

                            Except that I've never said that.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the form of this argument right now<br/>
<br/>
Sara: We should be proud of our geekiness. Which are those cool things we do. Unlike what those people on the other thread are talking about, which is not cool things, but self-consciousness.<br/>
Mike: You can call geekyness cool, but then that's not what anybody is saying should be removed from gaming. It's just the geeky parts.<br/>
Sara: But there are some non-gamers who don't see RPGs as geeky. You're saying that all non-gamers see RPGs as geeky.<br/>
Mike: Huh?<br/>
<br/>
If all you're saying is that there are self-conscious gamers out there, and that they do a poor job of presenting RPGs to others...and if your conclusion is that they should stop that? Well, nobody disagrees. But, then, that's not even remotely controversial. Nobody anywhere is saying anything like, "We need to get rid of the fun stuff in RPGs to dumb them down for "normies."<br/>
<br/>
Nobody. I'm not seeing any geeks here.<br/>
<br/>
You have to set the damn term aside for a minute. There are things in most RPGs that most non-gamers find hard to accept as qualities of a fun passtime. Like not having end-conditions on play, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
Average Non-Gamer: So how do you win?<br/>
Mike: Well, the goal of play is not to win, per se, but to overcome challenges or to creates stories and themes.<br/>
Average Non-Gamer: So in D&amp;D, it's like you're creating a play?<br/>
Mike: Well in D&amp;D you're playing to overcome challenges, mainly. And it's also not like a play in that you go on indefinitely.<br/>
Average Non-Gamer: So...how long does it take to play?<br/>
Mike: Well, indefinitely. Some people play for years.<br/>
<br/>
Average Non-Gamer's eyes glaze over at this point and they get a look that says, "Is this guy for real?"<br/>
<br/>
Not all of them. Some say, "Huh, sounds interesting, when can I play."<br/>
<br/>
Let me put it this way. You're not saying that there are no people who refuse to play becuse they see RPGs as geeky, right? Just that not all of them do. So what if I want to play with one of those people who do see it as geeky?<br/>
<br/>
SOL?<br/>

Okay, so, no it doesn't: Sara, I think I've finally got what you're driving at here.<br><br>But I also think it's a non-problem, not for philosophical reasons but for practical ones: whenever you introduce a potentially geeky subject to someone who may or may not be a geek to your knowledge, if they <i>are</i> a geek, you tend to just naturally find out in an awfully big hurry.

As I've been working on smaller social footprint, I've come on a fun way to invert that question.  Check out this dialogue for <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>:
<blockquote>Average Non-Gamer:  So ... how long does it take to play?<br>Tony:  About an hour for a first game.  Then if you want, you can play more, in the same story.  So somewhere between "an hour" and "as long as it's still fun."<br>Average Non-Gamer:  How long is it likely to stay fun?<br>Tony:  Depends.  Some campaigns keep going that way, from one episode to the next, for years.<br>Average Non-Gamer:  Years?  Seriously?  WOW!  That's intense!</br></br></br></br></blockquote>
If you can phrase it in terms of opportunity, rather than obligation, it's <i>sweeeeeet</i>!                        </div>

                            I think there's a disconnect here.  Mike Holmes -- you're saying that a geek is defined by trying to show off their specialized knowledge of trivia to make people think they're cool.  <br><br>Now, that doesn't match how I or my friends use the term, but I'll accept it for the moment.  <br><br>However, what does that definition of "geeky" imply for games?  Does it mean there has to be less specialized knowledge?  That doesn't seem to match that there are plenty of other hobbies which require specialized knowledge -- from fishing to knitting to whatever.  Conversely, this makes Trivial Pursuit pretty much the definition of a geeky game, since it specifically rewards knowledge of trivia.

Well, but this has nothing to do with geekiness, right?  This isn't about lording specialized knowledge over others.  You haven't lorded any specialized knowledge over the other speaker, nor given the impression that it occurs in the game.  The only thing you've suggested is that it's something which involves a large degree of commitment.  <br><br>That's generally a turn-off for people who only have casual interest in a hobby.  You'll get the same thing if you tell people about a serious rehearsal schedule of a play or taking over a year to make an amateur film.

Well, presuming that you mean "think of it as geeky in a negative sense", you presumably change how they think of it.  By your definition of geeky, only jerks are geeky.  So, don't be a jerk about it.  i.e. Don't act like you're cool for your specialized knowledge.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I don't think it has to do with complicated game matter, dice rolling, intricate systems or understanding the concept; I think it has to do with the attitude of "I'm not going to bother explaining this because you'll think it's stupid", from the gamer that causes the "but you'll think I'm stupid because I'm not a gamer...so I won't ask" I don't see that part being asked; and I'm interested in knowing why. </blockquote>
The other thread talks about those 'non-geek' gamers, and how to approach gaming with them.   I'm still just interested in if people realize that there's still alot of non-gamers who get thrown into that same lot, and would love to 'be a gamer-geek', but are being approached as if they will scorn it.                        </div>

Thanks for the cheer, but I don't fully agree with the 'it's all in your head' subtext.<br><br>I'm saying 'it's all in your zip code'.  <br><br>I've been bothered by cops and strangers across the US, for being 'different'.

                            Sara, John H., Curly: I'm coming late in the discussion so I can't contribute as much as you have, but I like the points you've made.  <br/><br/>I too would argue that gaming is not necessarily associated with geekiness at large ("it's all in your zip code" -- that's a funny one) and that where it is, it's not necessarily a bad thing (geek chic).  It seems to me that, stereotypes aside (including those perpetuated by self-conscious gamers), RPGs and story games have a lot more in common with a variety of mainstream-ish hobbies (e.g., murder mystery parties, improv theatre, board games, not to mention reading and writing*), than with typically geek-identified ones (e.g., computer programming as a hobby, stamp collecting, model building, amateur astronomy, etc.*)  This is the approach I take when someone is surprised to discover that I game, I game often, and I don't make any efforts to hide it.<br/><br/>* Of course, I personally have participated in <i>all</i> the examples of hobbies I just listed.  ;-)                        </div>

                            So, a few more personal reflections.  To me, geeky is a love and involvement of a particular set of mental activities.  (Deep involvement in sports or other physical activities isn't really geeky, though it can have some similarities.)    There are many different varieties, like there are film geeks who watch lots of movies and know all the landmarks, versus theater geeks or book geeks, etc.  <br/><br/>So, some kids that I know are geeky in the sense of being bookish, loving fantasy novels like Rowling and Tamora Pierce, and playing various games.  When I ran RPGs for them and other kids at ConQuest SF 2006, Zelly and Ellen both dressed up in velvety gothy dresses and colored their hair for the occaision.  So, what is this?  To me, I would call this geeky.  <br/><br/>The disconnect I feel is that there are people who say "Geeks are those who lord their specialized trivia over others" which basically assumes that geeks are people who act like jerks.  However, their response of how to make things less geeky are things like not having dragons or making campaign lengths shorter or not calling something a RPG.  There's a disconnect there.  If you want your games to be less geeky in the sense of being a jerk, then don't be a jerk or encourage being a jerk in your game.  <br/><br/>I approve of some of the changes to content in the name of more variety in RPGs -- but I don't think they are an inherent improvement over what we have, just different.                        </div>

                            The urban vs. suburban thing is new to me and it makes perfect sense. It drives politics, buying patters, race relations, why not hobby preferences?<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, class is a part of this too.

                            Hi JD,<br/>
<br/>
I think you're kind of missing a point here....<br/>
<br/>
If you're making six figures where <i>you</i> live collecting comics might get one kind of reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Here in L.A. -- Chris Carter (creator and producer of X-Files) is a self-professed geek. Nicholas Cage, geek. Michale De Luca, geek. Stephen Spielberg sometimes has to be dragged away from playing Crimson Skies and back onto a set. The list goes on. In Los Angeles geekiness is rewarded -- because we are the storytellers, the artists, the actors, the directors.<br/>
<br/>
But -- and I think this is a big but -- these people don't only <i>identify themselves</i> in geeks and don't only draw from the pool of geek culture. I think this is a complicated issue and this is part of it.<br/>
<br/>
When I think geeky, I think of self-imposed limitations -- socially, artistically, creatively and so on. People who gather socially to go see a movie that will, by all accounts, be terrible <i>because</i> it is the kind of movie that nerds will go see (ahem) boggle me.<br/>
<br/>
So, JD, this is the second time you've brought up your income. And I'm really, really glad you're doing well. But I think you're drawing the wrong axis here. I think Curley's post about zip codes and social structures bears a lot more thought on this matter.<br/>
<br/>
Los Angeles, like New York, is just one more example of this. Because here you will find the geeks who are awkward and <i>hide behind geekiness</i>, using geek elements in creative acts that only reflect back on themselves in an insular fashion (creatively, socially, professinally).<br/>
<br/>
And then there's a clod like me -- who stopped by his hot yoga teacher's home one night after running some games at a con, talking with great, fired up passion and male pride about spinning yarns on the fly, talking about art and the Homeric epics and the lost art of verbal storytelling... She offered me a beer and seduced me.<br/>
<br/>
It's not just the geek elements. It's what one does with them. It's why one is playing with them. It's how they fit into one's life as a whole. And what one's life is without them.<br/>
<br/>

                            Actually I don't make six figures, I am underpaid for my work (compared to the profession as a whole and the sub-section of the profession - litigators - that I'm a member of) and I'm deeply in debt - typically when I talk about myself in these threads I am talking about the other indicia of authority that I am able to wield (race, the power of the state, education). Other than that it seems like everything you said is in agreement with everything I said, so all I can say is "yep, exactly". <br><br>The only caveat I can add is that self-imposed limitations are not always self-imposed. There are all kinds of social expectations and all sorts of ways they can be learned. The people that learned geek omerta didn't just make it up out of nowhere - nothing comes out of nowhere. But that is a caveat for my statements as well.                        </br></br></div>

Ayup.<br><br>Every week, I go clubbing - at an industrial / goth nightclub.  There are a dozen or so D&amp;D geeks thereabouts - and they can be identified as the guys that identify <i>solely</i> as gamers.  They wear gamer shirts, they drink beer and try to chat up the pretty girls, but they sometimes seem to have limited themselves to this oddly circumscribed world even when they're well outside it - not always, and not all of them, but a couple of them.<br><br>I chat with them a little most nights I'm there, and a few of the other clubbers occasionally ask me why I'd want to hang out with those guys.  And every time, I look at the person asking as if they were a martian, and tell tham that I play games just like those guys do.<br><br>And then I watch them try to fit this into their notions of the world.<br><br>It's interesting.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I suppose that I'm reading into this that she's saying that we who are trying to "de-geek" games are doing so because we're ashamed? If not, then I'm trying to figure out what this thread is about.

Of course I'm sure that it's just me being defensive. A sure sign that I actually am one of the bad geeks she's talking about.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shutupgirl</cite>Because honestly?  What's wrong with being a geek?</blockquote>
Sara, Iâ€™m going to give a stab at answering this question, because I don't think it's meant rhetorically and you genuinely seem to want feedback; I hope this doesnâ€™t come across as combative. Actually, looking at your comments about wanting to â€œde-elitistâ€ I think we may be more or less on the same page.<br><br>Iâ€™m going to answer by posing the counter-question: What would be the consequences if gaming (the activity) was totally dissociated from geekdom?<br><br>Letâ€™s imagine that <b>*kazam*</b> creating fiction and experiencing imaginary situations socially was mainstream and ubiquitous. Your uncleâ€™s fishing buddies fill the odd day at the creek by weaving civil war stories; my boss spends the odd Sunday afternoons with his kids doing instalments of their soap opera. Itâ€™s fun, but itâ€™s no big deal to find it fun. The awesome, creative social endeavour that rpgs are have been severed from social identity â€“ itâ€™s not OUR thing, itâ€™s everybodyâ€™s, like TV or the cinema. <br><i>NB Note that this does not mean no more geek-friendly games, in terms of subject matter, level of commitment/esoteric knowledge demanded, complexity of mechanics or what have you. It does entail these games potentially becoming the fringe of gaming - but only because gaming has expanded to include all of non-geekdom - with the existing gamer crowd surrounded by dozens of millions of gamers and thousands of new products catering for them.</i><br><br>Some people â€“ and Iâ€™ll only speak for myself here â€“ think this would be great. Making stories is astounding stuff and (1) I think itâ€™s generally cool for more to people do it; (2) itâ€™s in my self-interest as it means more people to play with; (3) it doesnâ€™t cost me much as I am not heavily invested in the social identity of being someone in on the secret. (This last reason isnâ€™t because Iâ€™m a deep or profound person; itâ€™s chiefly because I only recently started gaming again.) <br><br>So this is the extreme of de-geeking the activity of gaming, and some reasons why one could see this as a good thing. The activity would be open to people without any demand for them to use geek content, procedures, invest in geek communities or adopt geek identity. Geekiness and fringe interest would form roughly as large a part of the activity as it does in anything else (e.g. themes for parties, content in films, song lyrics etc).<br><br>Some people â€“ based on sentiments gleaned from many threads about â€˜expanding the hobbyâ€™ across the internet â€“ are rather more hostile, and think that if changes were made so everyone and their mom could play, then it â€˜wouldnâ€™t be their hobby anymoreâ€™. And theyâ€™re right, it wouldnâ€™t. Moreover, if you (someone in this group) had defined yourself and your friends as being cool because you did this awesome creative thing, guess what? Bonnie, â€™02 class president, makes awesome detective romance stories with her nursing staff while sheâ€™s on call. Youâ€™re not doing anything special to them; they might find your choice of subject matter (â€˜elves and gnomes?â€™) a bit silly, however. <br/><br/>Itâ€™s clear many of this camp <i>are</i> interested in introducing new people (always â€˜newbiesâ€™, a  bit like â€˜babiesâ€™) to gaming, but always on  <i>their</i> terms: â€œI will teach you how to play, and play has emphasis on the following things that I am <i>also</i> an authority on etcâ€. The field remains theirs. Itâ€™s more or less what Mike Holmes is saying earlier about wanting to maintain excellence in a domain, and I donâ€™t think it makes someone a jerk. Itâ€™s understandable. Were the original fans at the Cavern Club all jerks for wishing the Beatles could always be theirs instead of the worldâ€™s?<br/><br/>So in answer to your question, what CAN be wrong with being a geek is reluctance to making an activity more accessible, because that would surrender to the masses the element of your creative identity that you are most confident in (I make fiction/live imagined experiences), and leave you only the elements more open to derision/criticism (topics like fairy tales or super heroes). This is only wrong from certain camps, though, such as the one Iâ€™m sitting in. Others could crunch the outcomes and decide that, yup, gamer geeks deserve to keep their activity their own much more than non-gamers deserve to get some of the action.<br/><br/>Perhaps weâ€™re talking to more or less the same point? Could also be that we disagree, or Iâ€™m totally talking past you. Let me know if this was food for thought or kitty litter <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>edited for minor punctuation stumbles.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

The problem with being defensive is you can miss the point, because your'e too focused on where the insult is.<br/><br/>there is no insult, just another big question.<br/><br/>There is nothing oblique about my statements, or where I got them from; but if it would make people feel better, I could go and quote the various people who wrote about the things I'm discussing; but is it nessisary?  I was under the assumption that people can read and form opinions for themselves and they'd be able to pick up where I was getting things; of course, I could have been mistaken.   I like to keep things casual, it just feels less like a debate and more like a discussion that way.<br/><br/>There are those who say that geek is snobbiness...I would say that no, insecure geeks can be snobs and that's a different problem.<br/><br/>Point being atm, is De-Geeking gaming going to actually fix the problem or is it a deluded idea because it's assuming that the only reason people don't play games is because they think they are 'geeky' or that playing them will make them a geek?<br/><br/>Alex makes some points that I don't deny are right, but it's still only part of the bigger picture.<br/><br/>And this is why I don't support taking the geek out of gaming.    It isn't gaming that is the problem, it's the GAMERS!<br/><br/>It's not the games you have to change; or should haev to change, it's the people who insist to non-gamers that you have to play them a certain way or not play at all.                        </div>

                            Yup. Social context, again. There's more than one way to play.<br/><br/>As far as people insisting otherwise, yes, they're the problem. That is... pretty much what we have been saying on the subject whenever it comes up.                        </div>

                            Sara, I'm hoping that it's merely the medium we're using that's causing this thread to have so little real communication going on.

<p>To follow up on Mike's comment, I think that you are damaging the conversation by accusing people of being defensive, rather than responding to what they have to say. I thought that Story-Games had a vibe of charitable reading which I'm not feeling you participate in, and that makes <em>me</em> not want to get involved here, even though this is a topic I care about.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>John, I specifically am not defining geeky, but saying that it has multiple meanings here, and that until we stop using the term to mean "That thing that I want it to mean" that this conversation can't go anywhere. Rather that Sara seems to me to be protesting in her original post about some sort of behavior that exists that I think doesn't exist in any of the threads to which she obliquely refers. She says "there's been a lot of talk about" something. She's saying that this indicates to her that there's some self-conscious behavior that needs to be corrected. Then she asks people in general not to "de-geek" her gaming. Given the fact that this is actually impossible (we're not going to come over to her house and force her to play Prime Time Adventures) isn't this a call to stop the drive to build games that appeal to people who don't like geeky stuff?</blockquote>
I don't know, Mike.  However, it might help to ask.  As I read it, Sara has explicitly said that she liked many of the ideas on the de-geeking thread.  However, she has expressed concern that part of the drive may be based on a mistaken principle that "de-geeking".   <br/><br/>So, Sara...   Are you calling to stop the drive to build non-geeky games?  Or are you just calling to re-think the reasons for it?  <br/><br/>To Alex: 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alex F</cite>Iâ€™m going to answer by posing the counter-question: What would be the consequences if gaming (the activity) was totally dissociated from geekdom?<br/><br/>Letâ€™s imagine that<b>*kazam*</b>creating fiction and experiencing imaginary situations socially was mainstream and ubiquitous. Your uncleâ€™s fishing buddies fill the odd day at the creek by weaving civil war stories; my boss spends the odd Sunday afternoons with his kids doing instalments of their soap opera. Itâ€™s fun, but itâ€™s no big deal to find it fun. The awesome, creative social endeavour that rpgs are have been severed from social identity â€“ itâ€™s not OUR thing, itâ€™s everybodyâ€™s, like TV or the cinema.</blockquote>
I think the consequences are fairly obvious or undefined.  For example, recruiting for current-style games might be easier or harder -- it isn't clear from the picture.  <br/><br/>However, note that you're making a big assumption here in your vision of what things will look like in your magical world.  I'm going to offer another magical world.  <br/><br/>Let's imagine that some years down the road, role-playing is mainstream and ubiquitous.  You and your fishing buddies go down to the stream and play some old-style Lord of the Rings story games while fishing, while your nephew and his friends are playing with boffer swords around the camp.  Your son's boss spends some weekend time with his kids doing some installments of their space opera saga.  <br/><br/>Is there a difference between our magical world-pictures?  I'm not saying that either is likely or unlikely, but that there are assumptions within each.                        </div>

Sure. I am not particularly interested in all the ins and outs of this fictional world - I'm not about to go and game in it, after all  - it's just being used as a hypothetical, to frame how decoupling gaming from elements of geek culture might strike different people, on a visceral, identity level. You're free to delve into it further, if you find it illuminating, but honestly, anything of value you find in there you can keep!<br/> <br/>And absolutely, I am making some assumptions. That's the cool thing about creating a magical world! I put together my situation to highlight what I wanted to. I find your alternative kind of interesting - if I understand you, it posits that both the activity of gaming, and the geeky bits that surround it (content, but maybe also hardcore rules, high buy-in in time and research, etc), become mainstream. But I can't work out if there's an actual question behind it. Could you help me out with that?                        </div>

                            Mike, I didn't call you defensive, you said you might have been being so.    I just commented that the problem with being defensive is you can miss the point by looking for insults.   I certaintly didn't mean to imply that you were or weren't being.  Just that if you take away any suggestion of insult, there's only a question left.<br><br>I am wondering however if you think this thread was to attack your thread, and if maybe that's where you're getting those ideas from.   I'll re-state again, I'm not attacking your thread, but I don't want to talk about de-geeking games.  I started this thread so people could continue talking about ways to de-geek games, while I ask if that's really the solution.

Exactly.     I am just calling to re-think the reasons for it.   I don't say it shouldn't be done, I just have my doubts about whether it is being done for reasons that may not be the true culprit.<br/>It bothers me that certain statements seem very extremist, and I've always been a middle-ground believer.

I've restated several times, and nothing I've ever asked even comes close to that statement you just made.   You are taking a very extreme example and placing it in my mouth; leaving me with no other option than wonder where you are drawing that conclusion from.<br/><br/>There'd be alot more communication if the question could be discussed instead of defending or attacking the definition of a geek.                        </br></br></div>

                            Sara, I'm not trying to place anything in anybody's mouth.  I'm trying to figure out where the argument is.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote: "What's wrong with being a geek?  . . . Bah! I'm proud to be a geek . . . You want to make more gaming seem less geeky to outsiders? Then don't act as if it's something to be embarrassed about in the first place. . . . Don't de-geek my gaming. I don't need it de-geeked at all...and I'm just fine with it the way it is."<br/>
<br/>
And I'm trying to answer: to me, the question's tautological.  "What's wrong with suffering a social stigma?"  Plenty, if you resent being stigmatized by non-gamers (not everyone does, and that's fine).  I want a de-geeked game so that I can do what I like to do, without the risk of being mentally associated with losers by people I've just met.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: A portion of this thread involves, "Where does this stereotype--that geekiness is a social stigma, and gamers are losers--come from?  Maybe it's all in your head."  I suppose that's possible.  But I haven't seen a single positive representation of RPG's in mass media.  (Okay, <i>Cryptonomicon</i> maybe, but that's for people who are geeks already.)                        </div>

                            Sara, I think I'm seeing your argument. It is (in part) as follows: <br><br>#1) I, Sara, question, if not reject, that the general public has a problem with gamers as <i>geeks</i> or any social stigma that may represent (gamers in their parents basements, etc.).<br><br>#2) I, Sara, claim that a likelier reason people are kept away from gaming is that (some?) gamers act like elitist snobs who say things like "This game's just too cool/smart/complicated/whatever for little old you" and that this attitude is off-putting. <br><br>So, I -- and several others in this thread -- disagree with your rejection (1 above) which is causing a bunch of noise on your thread because you aren't interested in discussing that here. <br/><br/>ALSO, you are repeating this dysfunctional "elitist" gamer attitude involved in actively dissuading interested people from playing the games (#2 above). <br/><br/>So, you are making this claim (again, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above) and I'm really puzzled. I do not see this commonly. I have never heard this issue brought up before. It's pretty interesting, but I'm skeptical that it's widespread.<br/><br/>Is it widespread? Have you experienced this personally? Have you experienced it multiple times? From an individual or from multiple people? Do you think it stemmed as some kind of gender issue (i.e. people didn't want you to play because you're a woman, for example)? Do you see others experiencing this issue? <br/><br/>By the way, I do think it's perfectly reasonable to attribute problems to both <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>. They are not logically inconsistent or contradictory. I don't know that you're doing that, but this thread seems to be lumping them together frequently.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I think the issue is that given that some people make that mental association, there are many possible responses which someone can make.  <br/><br/>One response would be to say something like "Well, fantasy RPG players <i>are</i> often fat, balding virgins -- but I'm not like those geeks.  I play cool story games which are about the Civil War or soap operas instead of geeky stuff like knights and dragons."  <br/><br/>Another is to say "Actually fantasy gamers aren't fat, balding virgins.  Most of us are cool people."  <br/><br/>Personally, I enjoy playing a lot of fantasy RPGs (and I like reading a lot of fantasy and sci-fi books), so I usually prefer the second to the first.  But there are other answers as well.                        </div>

                            Matt - Pretty much what I answer my own questions from my point of view and from what I've seen from others in the past, (some on a personal level)   I'm not saying those answers are right or wrong, those are simply my opinions.  I am not interested in the part regarding the social stigma's and how gamers deal with it as much as I am questioning if it IS, for some level, something we're over-reacting to.   I am not asking how to 'fix' this perception that others have it, because my thread is questioning how valid that perception is.   (the other thread is assuming this is the perception others have for gaming, and how to fix that so it doesn't come off as geeky to outsiders and that's why I keep pushing those arguements over to that one)<br/><br/>And, I'm still wanting to know other's answers to it, see the different point of views, and discuss on whether or not those views really have as much effect as we might have thought they did.<br/><br/>I have indeed experienced it personally, and I've seen people do it to others, sometimes without them even realizing it and I'll admit it drives me batty.   There's nothing more dissapointing than watching someone light up when they think they're going to get to learn something and then get brushed off by someone who doesn't take that interest seriously; for whatever reasons.  (and I'd want to explore if people themselve are doing it without realizing it)<br/>Most of the people that I've personally recruited, Consist of a big chunk of people to gaming who have been trying to get into gaming for awhile and just never could seem to find a way in, or who no one would give the time of day to.<br/><br/>So while the other thread talks about how to make games seem like we aren't all geeks, I'm just trying to get the other side in...and ask if anyone even realizes that it IS there; because I feel like it's overlooked alot.<br/><br/>Some people want in, geeky or not.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>Sara, I think I'm seeing your argument. It is (in part) as follows:<br/><br/>#1) I, Sara, question, if not reject, that the general public has a problem with gamers as<i>geeks</i>or any social stigma that may represent (gamers in their parents basements, etc.).<br/><br/>#2) I, Sara, claim that a likelier reason people are kept away from gaming is that (some?) gamers act like elitist snobs who say things like "This game's just too cool/smart/complicated/whatever for little old you" and that this attitude is off-putting.<br/><br/>So, I -- and several others in this thread -- disagree with your rejection (1 above) which is causing a bunch of noise on your thread because you aren't interested in discussing that here.</blockquote>
Well, I don't speak for Sara, but that isn't how I read here.  As I understand it, her reference to snobs is about Mike Holmes suggested definition of a geek.  What he said was: <br/><br/><i>A good definition of "Geek" is a person who, due to feelings of inadequacy in comparison to the general populace (possibly because of actual rejection by said populace), applies themselves to rarified fields in which they can excel, in order to reclaim some semblance of self-esteem, often by lording thier understanding of the subject matter over others who also apply to said field.</i><br/><br/>So, let me assume that the public perception is that gamers are fat, balding guys who live in their parents basement, snobbily lord their knowledge of trivia over others (as per Mike), read fantasy novels, and play D&amp;D.  (Note that this merges both your claim of the living in parents' basement image and the "snob" claim.)  <br/><br/>One response is to say, "Aha!!  The problem with the is the reading of fantasy novels and playing D&amp;D.  We should change our games so that they aren't about F/SF subjects."    However, it seems quite possible to me that if, say, soap opera games surpass D&amp;D in popularity that we'll just be dealing with a new stereotype of "Gamers are fat, balding guys who live in their parents' basement, lord their specialized knowledge over others, and play Soap."  <br/><br/>Another response would be to target other parts of the stereotype rather than the "fantasy/dragons" part.                        </div>

                            I think that the negative connotations of being a Geek, or Spaz, Nerd, whatever, (pop in your witty snobbery term here), is due to the self-proclaimed elite of our teenage years condescending on everyone else and using such terms as an insult.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, as children, geeks DID have feelings of inadequacy...but fate is cruel to those that are cruel...and much more than threefold I might add!<br/>
<br/>
You wanna see the truth of it?  Go to your 20 year high school reunion!<br/>
<br/>
Those pretty &amp; popular ones are broken and hollow shells, the lot of them....<br/>
<br/>
The "I don't wanna be a geek" philosophy is, in my humble and arrogant opinion, borne of a desire to be accepted by the "normal" folk that toss out the "are you from mars" look when the topic of gaming is brought up by an avid hobbiest.<br/>
<br/>
I am for the TAO of the Geek!  I am, I am me!  And, to edify, or at least pontificate, the original statements!  If I am to be labelled a geek, so be it.  I never cared much for that shallow, cookie-cutter, mono-dimensional ideal of average and normal.<br/>
<br/>
We have other words for average and normal...BORING and MUNDANE!<br/>
<br/>
Besides, being a geek puts me in some fine company...Socrates, Beethoven, Mozart, Pavarotti, Ghandi, Isaac Newton, Einstein, Bill Gates, All the members of Rush, Stephen King, Vin Deisel (who is an avid D&amp;D player), Mark Twain,and a plethora of others.<br/>
<br/>
Thereofre, all you others can attempt to rework your life, your hobbies, your heart, your soul, your passions...into the non-geekery; which transaltes into normal and average; which again translates into MUNDANE &amp; BORING&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I choose the better spirit of soul, heart, and company<br/>
<br/>
THE GEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now does this make me cooler than thou because I'm a geek and revel in my geekdom AND play RPG's into the wee hours of the night?  Nope!  Am I cool because I game?  Nope.  Am I cool because of the games I play?  Nope!<br/>
<br/>
I'm just cool (at least to my geeky self) because I live my life and enjoy it.  I have no need for acceptance from others that do not share my hobbies joys and passions.  I likewise have long ago shed myself and my psyche of such judgemental things as looking a thou and saying that I'm cooler than you.  You wanna learnto play you normal person, you?  Sure, step on up, grab a soda (help yourself to my booze if you're of age and NOT driving because mi casa is su casa).<br/>
  Being cool because one is a gamer  is like saying that a BMW is th eultimate type of vehicle because a person in Denmark has a psatula in their kitchen drawer...that's right, it's nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that Ms. Sara was simply stating that it's absurd to be in a group that is considered to be comprised of geeks and then claim that you are not geeky...in fact, if living your life as you enjoy it makes you a geek, then so be it.  And if you're happy with who and what you are, then that's cool.  Others that don't enjoy gaming...hey they're still cool, they just don't get down on the same kind of hobbies.                        </div>

                            Victor, you have just demonstrated why I want nothing to do with identifying as a geek. <br/><br/>Among other things, it lets you maintain absurd judgments about "pretty &amp; popular" people, assume that normal is "BORING &amp; MUNDANE," and maintains the idea that letting your geek flag fly loudly while also vocally urging "No I'm not cool because I'm a geek, I'm just cool because I'm alive" all while ignoring that it's precisely what those pretty and popular people, and BORNING &amp; MUNDANE people do to be happy in <i>their</i> lives. You fail to self-recognize that your extreme enthusiasm for the geek lifestyle is a judgment of other lifestyles. <br/><br/>Everyone judges. It's clear to me those boring and mundane and hollow-lived popular high school people (who actually aren't hollow and unpopular, as it happens) judge geeks, for example, and want nothing to do with the geek lifestyle just as you want nothing to do with them. But, not everyone does it while mocking BORING &amp; MUNDANE people. Some certainly do. I've seen some pretty damning stuff about gamers, for one.<br/><br/>But, none of this excuses living in judgment of "BORING &amp; MUNDANE" people. Thinking like that is precisely thinking you are cooler than they are because you are a geek, BMWs and spatulas notwithstanding. It's exactly nonsense like this that inspired me to intiate this series of topics on Story Games.
<blockquote>it's absurd to be in a group that is considered to be comprised of geeks and then claim that you are not geeky...in fact, if living your life as you enjoy it makes you a geek, then so be it.

Finally, with this paragraph, you indicate that you cannot separate role-playing the activity from role-playing the sub-culture of geeks. Your language here makes it impossible to separate the two. One is either a gamer and a geek, or a person who doesn't enjoy gaming. (But they're still cool! Because we musn't judge ... and yet judge anyway!) I reject this assumption. This saves me the effort of having to demonstrate to people skeptical of my claims that this assumption exists among the gaming sub-culture. I can point right to your paragraph and shrug.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I think the issue is that given that some people make that mental association [between gaming and losers], there are many possible responses which someone can make . . .

Okay, if that's what's being said, I'm down with that.  <br/><br/>I'm happy to accept provisionally two of Sara's additional points:<br/>1.  Some people might be interested in gaming [i]because[/i] it's geeky<br/>2.  Some geeks are too geek-snobby to play with the less geeky<br/><br/>...but they don't show up in my daily life.  As a result, I don't have much to add, except the geek-snobs in Sara's example seem like jerks, and that the existence of less-geeky games wouldn't drive the geekier games out of existence.  They'd still be around, and people who were curious about them could still play.                        </div>

                            Now, I'm going to demonstrate why I usually try to keep my posts general and quote rarely.<br/>I'd like to re-iterate that while I do not agree with the following subjects quoted, I have nothing against Matt, I have something against the views stated.<br/>

Matt, there is nothing absurd about what he said.   Just because you do not agree with this view, does not make it absurd.   Just because you may not agree, understand or accept his point of view does NOT mean it is absurd.   It is perfectly acceptable to say "The judgement you make sounds absurd to me", and it is absolutely NOT okay to start attacking the person.   I haven't said anything the entire thread because I thought perhaps it was a moment of overzealousness; but you're getting more abusive as the thread continues.  (absusive as stepping over that line that seperates the person from their ideas)<br/>
<blockquote>You fail to self-recognize that your extreme enthusiasm for the geek lifestyle is a judgment of other lifestyles.</blockquote>
Matt.    What would you call what you just did, and have been doing throughout this thread?   I believe all that gladen is trying to say is that while some people frown down on being 'geeky', that he's proud of it and his view tends to be to just consider anyone who would comment otherwise could be seen as just as boring; because it works two ways...and there's nothing wrong with being proud of one.<br/><br/>Matt; You need to seperate the person from the idea and go after the idea...NOT the person.   You've chosen not to do that this entire thread and it's really not fair to anyone.  All I am seeing in your posts at this point is attacking anyone who seems to be just fine with being seen as geeky.
<blockquote>Everyone judges.</blockquote>
But this does not give anyone the right to insult someone for disagreeing with you.   Please go back and read your threads and evaluate why you felt the need to attack people instead of the ideas; it could be that you were caught in the moment, or it could be that you didn't realize you were doing it.   
<blockquote>It's clear to me those boring and mundane and hollow-lived popular high school people (who actually aren't hollow and unpopular, as it happens) judge geeks, for example, and want nothing to do with the geek lifestyle just as you want nothing to do with them. </blockquote>
Correct me if I am wrong, but I translate this as "The cool kids aren't hollow and unpopular, the geeks are the ones people make fun of, and I want to be friends with the geeks, but I don't want anyone to think that I'm a geek...so lets not do anything that might make the cool kids not like me; because I'd rather that the cool kids see me as a cool kid too"   If I'm wrong on this translation, please explain your words, because chances are, I'm not the only one reading it that way and it gives you a chance to explain or re-phrase.
<blockquote>But, not everyone does it while mocking BORING &amp; MUNDANE people. Some certainly do.

My thoughts on this is that it is all perspective.   If you think a batch of people are cool, someone else could think those same batch of people are losers.  Just because you have an opinion, doesn't mean yours is the only one that is right.  This is one of the reasons why I think it's pointless to make the assumption that the problem with gaming is that it is made to be too geeky for normal people to play, it's all a point of view thing.<br/><br/>One of my biggest gripes with this assumption?   It's all perspective.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with most of the posts that seem to agree with that quote up there?   Is that it seems to divide those who agree with you and those who don't agree with you as the "The Cool kids I want to be like" and "The kids that the cool kids make fun of, so I don't want to be seen with you" and honestly, there is nothing cool about knocking down people and placing them INTO groups.<br/><br/>It's perfectly fine to talk about the type of groups, as long as you remember that it is only one point of view; and that's why it's okay...because no one has to agree that the groups are non-inclusive or absolute.

Matt, you continue to make negative assumptions and judgements about <b>people</b> based only on their opinion.  (and I mean actual people, like posters, instead of a generalized idea of a person that isn't real and only used as an example)<br/>This suggests that you are unable or unwilling at the moment, to negotiate the idea without going after the person; I highly suggest you re-think this strategy as there is nothing cool about it; period.  Just because you do not agree or understand, does not give you the right to  start insulting them or their views.<br/><br/>Yes, it is true that everyone judges.   But what is being shown with your words right now is the lack of willingness to try and make  your arguement without insulting someone for disagreeing with you.    I'm not saying you're doing it on purpose, but you are doing it, and I just want to be aware of it.<br/><br/>While I may not agree with your opinions, I don't think any less of you for them, but I do draw a line at personal attacks for opinions.<br/>Respect the opinions of others, even if you don't agree.  (and like I said, I'm not going to make assumptions on why you are doing it, but am pointing it out to you)<br/>I'm sorry if this comes across as being an ass, I just do not know of a nicer way to bring it up.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>James, I agree completely, and isn't that why we post stuff like this?   To demonstrate that sometimes what we are exposed to isn't always what is the norm for others in the soam boat?   It's one of the reasons I wanted to know everyone's view on the subject, but also stated my own.                        </div>

                            The only thing I find unpleasant about anyone's posts here is each time I read one and see someone dissing a person instead of disagreeing with the idea.<br/><br/>It's just not nessissary.   We're all adults, I'd like to think we can discuss our statements without actually insulting a person for making them.<br/><br/>_edited to add this line-<br/>I'm going to re-state, I do NOT have a problem with Matt, and I don't think he's some big jerk.   I just think the posts have been consistantly getting more personal and I think that needs to be addressed now,instead of 10 posts from now.                        </div>

                            Sara, this is me strongly criticizing your views and behavior on this thread specifically and on this forum in general.<br/><br/>You have posted on this forum many, many times in an extremely defensive manner, convinced that you are reading ad hominem attacks where there are none. At no point in my thread have I said anything like "Victor, you're a judgmental prick" or "Victor, you're a loser" or "Victor, shut up because you're a geek" and so on. Those would be actual ad hominem arguments that attack the person not the argument. <br/><br/>Instead, I used language, which you clearly don't like, to strongly criticize Victor's arugments. For example, this phrase "absurd judgments," which criticizes Victor's OPINION (i.e. his JUDGEMENTS), rather than Victor himself (i.e. "Victor, you ARE absurd"). You clearly view it as an attack. This is erroneous.<br/><br/>For example, you accuse me of being constantly unable to separate the person from the argument, implying that I've insulted Victor. This is untrue. Your reactions are faulty. You are, apparently, unable to recognize an actual attack on a person from a criticism on his views. I urge you to reconsider; I read your posts as close-minded and defensive when the content of those posts contradicts your preferences. <br/><br/>Regarding your interpretation of my statements, consider this me correcting you because you are wrong, as you requested. For example, the following is a gross misinterpretation of my intentions and statments: 
<blockquote>The cool kids aren't hollow and unpopular, the geeks are the ones people make fun of, and I want to be friends with the geeks, but I don't want anyone to think that I'm a geek</blockquote>
Please knock that off and try to re-assess my opinions without assuming I'm either a mean guy or must be acting out of some kind of self-loathing. Neither is true.                        </div>

Neither is true.<br/><br/>I never said that you actually believe that, I simply stated how I interpreted it and asked you to explain because I seriously doubt that it was what you meant.<br/>But, since that's what I got, I'd like to know what you DID mean.   There's no hidden snarkiness in my words, I'm just very literal.  I'm not trying to hint at anything, or suggest some hidden agenda.                        </div>

                            There's one thing that I'd like to just remind everyone, including me.<br><br>It is perfectly okay to have different opinions based on the same facts.    It's natural, and expected, but it does not have to turn into who is right and who is wrong; it's all a point of view thing.   I opened this thread up to GET different points of view on something that I think is started to get clumped into an absolute that I personally don't is.  I don't take anything personal if someone disagrees with me, but I will get more and more debative; this isn't because I think someone is wrong, but I may not agree with them, and will simply continue to pry more out about 'why' they feel the way they do, especially if they feel that they are right.<br><br>I admit that it's a fatal flaw, that when someone is speaking something that is entirely their opinion as a fact, I will question that opinion until the person acknowledges that my opinion, or someone else's doesn't have to be theirs.  - but simply that it exists and isn't non-existant-<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be an ass if I do this, I'm just trying to point out that there isn't just one answer for the same question.<br/><br/>I'm dissapointed that this thread has turned into splitting hairs and getting angry at others.<br/><br/>-finishing my post, as I had to leave quickly and didn't manage to finish it.-<br/><br/>I love arguements that are constructive or are trying to get the other point of view, or explore reasons for why people have opinions.   I simply don't, and never will like people being told that they are full of shit, or wrong when the only 'proof' of being wrong is someone having a different opinion.  THAT is what is bullshit.<br/><br/>I look at this thread and sorry, but I just see a bunch of people jumping in to judge posters for the opinion, instead of argueing with the opinion.   Maybe my perception is wrong on it, because I'm taking it too literally, or maybe it's actually there.<br/><br/>But all it is at this point is attacks; so what's the point of that?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<b><i>What is going on?</i></b><br/>
<br/>
Members of a very large group with varied and disperate agendas and tastes are struggling to make sure the group isn't varied or disperate and get the people who want a different kind of group to <i>just back down</i>. Just like the Republicans are going through within their ranks now. And the Dems will do in the run up to the presidential election.<br/>
<br/>
It happens.<br/>

                            I don't want anyone to back down, I just want them to not belittle an opinion just because it doesn't mesh with theirs. (if I'm guilty, just point it out, I'll always be the sort to go back and explain differently so it's more clear) <br><br/>I didn't go on the de-geek thread and say "you shouldn't make games less -geeky, because that'd be pointless and ruin the thread.<br/>I made this thread because I DO have an interest in why people think it's so nessisary to de-geek, why people are taking this approach and I'd love to encourage other trains of thought.    I have been a bit frustrated with the constant assumption that I must be against de-geeking games.    As others pointed out, I liked alot of what i read on that thread, AND, I actually agreed with some of it.   I just didn't agree with everything, and took the question from 'how to de-geek' to, 'Is de-geeking the real problem?"    I don't see how that's stupid, or pointless...or insulting.<br/><br/>Also, when I say,  "I've already said, or, I've already explained."   I'm not trying to be a jackass, I'm just pointing out where I said it because I've already said it more than once and I figure if I point out where, you can read it and understand it.   (someone mentioned this made me sound snobbish and I want to clarify it wasn't my intention at all, I just figured it would help with the point of view)                        </br></div>

                            What the heck?!?  <br/><br/>Victor / gladen's post may have been over-the-top enthusiastic, but he didn't belittle anyone here -- calling them nonsense or saying that they are the problem.  I may not speak in the manner as him, but given that my license plate says "RPGNERD", I'm closer to his position than most of the others.  If you want to gainsay him, I'd ask that you say a positive statement about your own position rather than picking him apart.  <br/><br/>I'm not going to say a word about anyone else, but I'm going to speak about myself some.  I'm not much of a D&amp;D player, but I play plenty of other traditional games.  I don't hide that, and I talk about it the same way that I talk about my other activities to my friends and acquaintances.  I started gaming in third grade in 1978, and jumped into serious gaming in college in 1987.  It has been a very positive influence in my life, I feel.  I have found many friends as well as my wife through gaming.  These are the exact same activities which have the stigma people talk about.  So if I have a problem with the stigma, I want to take it on directly.  Regardless of what RPGs there may be in the future, I feel that role-playing as it exists deserves no stigma.  <br/><br/>As for what I would like from games: I would like more games to play with my own friends.  And yes, most of my non-gaming friends are still geeky in some way.  Say, Shannon is a mother of three whom we met at the local mother's club lends me comic books, and though she hadn't role-played before, I invited her to my testing of my Truth &amp; Justice game for GenCon this year.  I'd like to see if she would play some more games.  Or Emily, a friend of ours who used to babysit for our son.  She has a huge tattoo of an elf on her back, which I think qualifies her as geeky.  Similarly, I'd like to run more games at WisCon next year, a feminist science fiction convention in Madison, Wisconsin.  <br/><br/>So I'd like different but still geeky games which my friends would enjoy.                        </div>

I guess I missed something.  Can you summarize the constructive suggestion(s) made?  <br/><br/>As for Story Games being a nice zone, well, I can't answer for anyone else's old wounds, but I'll speak for myself.  I have zero fear of receiving any harm from words spoken on this forum.  However, if people keep acting like jerks, then I'll stop talking here.  Story Games doesn't <i>need</i> to be a nice zone, but in general if we tolerate people being jerks -- particularly to new posters -- then eventually that's the people who will be left.  People like Sara will go talk elsewhere.                        </div>

Okay.<br/><br/>I want to have games that are inherently less "geek stuff" on tap so that I can run them at big-ass family reunions.  Because my family, most especially my mother, are people that bought into the whole "D&amp;D is Evvvviiiil." and never quite got past it, but we <i>also</i> have an extended family culture of sitting around and playing game after game long into the night.                        </div>

I started <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3422" rel="nofollow">the thread over on RPG</a>... and I can't say I found it <i>more</i> respectful than this one -- I think it's just that there are more people on RPG that agree with your point of view.  In fact... looking back over the other thread, I think it's very much <i>not</i> more respectful.                        </div>

                            That was kind of my point.  (about the respect level)<br/>
A further explanation would be that SG seemed to hold itself to a higher standard...but this thread makes it appear that the standard seem like a conditional thing.  Something to be said and flaunted but not applied if it's not convienent.<br/>
<br/>
Set the bar high, and going lower than that bar sets you as the asshat.   By the Standards SG set, RPG level is set at asshat...so no one is suprised when it stays that level, and it's not really out of character.   At the standards I've seen SG speak about, SG sinks to RPG level...and more than SG is comfortable to admit.<br/>
<br/>
So, what's worse?   Asshats who are always asshats?   Or Asshates pretending to not be Asshats?    At least one, isn't a suprise when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Either you have a higher standard and an open minds that make people feel like they can express themselves without being attacked, or you don't.  You can't have both.                        </div>

<blockquote>What just blows me away is how SG talked about being better than RPG</blockquote>
Holy what? Hold up a minute, I need you to stop for a second and back that up:<br/>Who said "Story Games are <b>better than</b> RPGs"??? <b>We all play RPGs</b>. And "Story Game" is nothing more than the title of this site, it's not a thing in and of itself. We have been using the word "Story Game" loosely to talk about RPGs (or 95% RPG-like activities) that focus a little more on Situation or Themes than, say, the typical red-box D&amp;D session. Some people like it. Some people don't like the traditional experience after messing around with situation and themes. But I don't recall anyone using words like "better than" here. It's not a view I hold, and I'm not easily recalling anyone dropping blanket statements like that.
<blockquote>You can't claim to be more open-minded than someone else if you're going to do the things you say you can't stand in the first place.  If you are going to resort to the same things you claim makes another place, person or board immature, then you're no better.</blockquote>
You've totally lost me here. I'm not seeing what you're seeing. If someone was calling RPGs immature, they'd have a lifespan on this site of about 12 minutes. 
<blockquote>Something to think about, and then consider on why so many people whisper to each other intead of talking, for fear of being reemed.</blockquote>
Please note that there are 640 user accounts here. And from what I see in the sql stats, I'm averaging that maybe half of those are somewhat active (even if it's just "check in, lurk, peek at threads, check out"), and the rest check in irregularly (200 or so) or "never check in" (about 100; folks who left, or folks who created their account to peek at one thread, then split). As far as I can tell, after looking through this thread and discarding the single replies, only about <i>nine people</i> were actively participating in this discussion. It breaks down to about "3 people for your opinion; 3 people against your opinion; and 3 people putting forth their own ideas".<br/><br/>Other folks didn't participate not because we were afraid of speaking our minds, but simply because we didn't care about the topic. The 200+ regular viewers of this site just aren't hung up enough on the "geek issue" to comment on it. In my case, I simply don't give a rat's ass either way what the definition of "geek" is, or if "I am a geek", or whatnot. I don't lose sleep at night either way, and yet have no problem with folks creating discussions on this site to work out their own personal issues with that topic.

I'm really not getting you here... are you perhaps meaning "TheRPGsite Forums" when you say "RPG" above?<br/><br/>If so, then what is "failed miserably"?  What would "success" have been? Convincing everyone that you are right? Getting more people (who again, don't care either way) to chime in just to let us know that they're listening? (this site software doesn't track how many people have been "peeking" at a topic like other forums)  What was your criteria for 'success', and how did this thread not meet that criteria?<br/><br/>As far as I've seen, people have mostly remained on topic, no one's tried to actively derail the thread. And all I see is flames that happen from friction when one person's personal issues rub up against others', generating friction.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Ah, sorry, my bad: Yeah, after seeing your post above, you were saying "RPG" when you meant "TheRPGSite".  <br/><br/>So yeah, uh... not much I can say there, other than while I'm vocal about my dislike of Pundit's hypocritical speech and behavior, I've never said anything about TheRPGSite sucking or filled with asshats or whatever. So your comments of "S-G saying it's better than TheRPGSite"; simply not true. Even to me personallly, the parts of TheRPGSite that the administrator of that site doesn't stomp all over as an extension of his personal blog (like many of the general gaming threads he creates) are pretty damn interesting (hell, even the threads the Pundit DOES create that <i>aren't</i> focused on calling people "cunts" and "shitheads" can get really cool at times), with a smaller people pool than RPGNet, so more concentrated, interesting responses in general.<br/><br/>So please don't be misreading me as starting some sort of "us or them"/"us good them bad" bullshit. A lot of us have accounts on BOTH sites, and contribute to both.<br/><br/>And sorry I misread you there on the first part my previous post, I should have picked that up right away.<br/><br/>Still, though, I see "tensions are high" as some 3-4 people (focusing on one or two) disagree with 3-4 other people (again, focusing on one or two) on deep-seated beliefs. But I don't see "failure" by any criteria that I hold to (I might be just missing it, though).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            No worries Andy, I realized the mis-fire right away and didn't take offense at all.<br/>
<br/>
I admit that I'm aggitated as well, mostly because I personally felt SG was a friendlier place to discuss things, and I was also thinking back to that "SG, Too Damn Nice?" thread.   There's alot of references to of how people came to SG BECAUSE it was a friendlier place, and that posters in general felt as if they wouldn't be attacked for stating an opinion.<br/>
<br/>
In this thread alone, it was implied that I was talking complete bullshit (more than once by the same person) just because I didn't go back and quote everything.   Calling someone's theory complete bullshit and suggesting that it's all in thier head is exactly the type of thing that makes people feel like they can't say anything without being insulted or belittled.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion, sometimes it's NICER to not quote someone when you make a reference so they don't feel singled out, or that THEY are being attacked.  Why should I have to quote someone to talk about an idea, and to reference what I've seen in more than just someone's single post?<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit crude in my example above, going to the extreme so that I could make a point.<br/>
A more relevent example would be that if people are proud of something, then don't go acting in ways that embarrass or demean that supposed source of pride.<br/>
<br/>
And think about if what you are doing is being done becuase you want to be constructive, or if you just want to be right and the other person wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Doing something to try and make yourself look right and someone else wrong is being an asshat.<br/>
Doing something because you don't AGREE with someone else and want them to explain, so that you can see all of the places that your theories are different, I think that's great.<br/>
<br/>
When you start belittling ideas, you're suggesting that the person is just wrong and they just don't get it...and that's lowballing the point of the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
-edited-<br/>
And I'm by no means saying that everyone on SG is doing it, or has done it.   Just that it does exist and it's an insult to those who want something 'more' than that.                        </div>

                            Sara,<br/><br/>Last time I checked, "belittling" ideas was fair game. Kinda the point of a critical discussion. They're just ideas. A good dialogue can hopefully result from that. Trying to invalidate <i>individuals</i> and their <i>experiences</i>, on the other hand, is just awful and fruitless.<br/><br/>Or, you could resort to calling people asshats.<br/><br/>I really don't see where anyone's attacking you personally. I see people offering arguments in support of their points of view, I see you getting defensive against arguments that were never made and calling participants names.<br/><br/>I am, admittedly, a little disgusted with myself for getting involved in some threads that seem to be more about identity politics, inherently prone to this sort of ugliness. I should know better. Live and learn, I guess. If anyone's taken anything I've written said as a personal attack, I apologize. Sheesh.<br/><br/>I'm actually pleasantly surprised we've gotten through all this without someone comparing somebody else to Hilter and the Nazis.<br/><br/>Larry,<br/>Asshat                        </div>

                            I said asshats as a general thing, I figured it was an easy relation.  I don't think anyone here IS an asshat, but I think some people did resort to acting like one.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't called anyone names.   Read V's post.   Read M's post right after that.   That for me, was the trigger, because the line was completely trounced and I am NOT the only one who saw it.    So, I went through and so that I wouldn't be called 'pulling things from nowhere', quoted exactly where I was pulling it from.<br/>
<br/>
Some people might not read something the same, but some people will.   <br/>
<br/>
I will go back and forth for eons about ideas and not think anything of it, nor will I consider it an insult if someone doesn't agree.   When someone on the other side starts commenting in a way that implies the person IS their idea, or that the person is your idea of something; that's insulting to that person.<br/>
<br/>
Or, to imply that because of an idea, someone is something else, that's just as insulting.    You don't have to resort to that to have a discussion, even if you don't agree.   I consider this thread a failure because there are several people who ARE insulted by it, and the things in it.<br/>
<br/>
Resorting to calling something stupid, irrelevent, pathetic, etc...is petty and insulting because it is not respecting the opinion of people who dont' think that.<br/>
If they thought it was irrelevent, pathethic or stupid, why would they care enough about it to post?<br/>
<br/>
This is where I'm pulling alot of hostility out of, and if I'll take heat for it, that's okay.  I know that I'm not the only one who wishes it wasn't here..it isn't needed.                        </div>

                            disclaimer, I don't mean you as someone in specificic but as in a general sense.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>My first impulse, I should be add, was to just stop posting.<br/>Then I stayed.   My impulse was to just stay quiet.<br/><br/>But I couldn't help but think that being quiet wouldn't solve the problem of what happened here.   It needs to be addressed.  <br/><br/> Some people think it's okay to insult an idea instead of just taking the time to pick it apart and try and argue the actual idea.   Insulting the idea implies that you don't care what anyone else thinks, you think you're right and anyone who doesn't agree with you, is the insult you just gave the idea.<br/><br/>Just because someone doesn't see it, doesn't mean someone else didn't.<br/><br/>Do you really want people to feel attacked, so that they don't question your idea anymore and feel they can't have an opinion, or that it's not okay to have it?
<blockquote>saying an idea is stupid when someone has expressed they believe it, is not kosher.<br/>you're not respecting that they don't think it's stupid.<br/>you're just dismissing it</blockquote> </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>Last time I checked, "belittling" ideas was fair game. Kinda the point of a critical discussion. They're just ideas. A good dialogue can hopefully result from that. Trying to invalidate<i>individuals</i>and their<i>experiences</i>, on the other hand, is just awful and fruitless.<br/><br/>Or, you could resort to calling people asshats.</blockquote>
In practice, the line between belittling ideas and people is thin to nonexistant.  If I say "that's a moronic idea" or "that argument is all bound up in stupid little identity arguments and self-hatred" -- well, it's pretty hard for the author to not take it as an attack.  <br/><br/>I think that rather than simply sticking to ideas, it's important to interpret the other person's view charitably rather than trying to finding fault.  Also, expressing things as disagreement ("I disagree with that") rather than calling the other view names ("That's stupid").  Now, I've often done the latter, so I'm at fault as often as others.  However, I don't think it's necessary for criticism.                        </div>

You know, I thought we were just mocking the whole Nazi thing.  <br/><br/>Anyway, you can say you disagree with a statement and argue your point without resorting to name-calling like "stupid" and "bullshit".                        </div>

                            OK, I've been forced back into a thread I said I wouldn't post to again. That might be a first. Congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sense that I may be being attacked. Oh, my name has never been used. But a term I recently used a lot has been used, and some ambigous behavior has been mentioned which might be attributed to me.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm simply asking if you could, Sara, either name me specifically if it is, in fact, myself who you are insulting, or, if it is not myself, then that you please let people know here that it is not. If it's the former, then I may defend myself. If it's the latter, then I don't need to.<br/>
<br/>
That's only fair, no?<br/>
<br/>
Mike<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I think that you've mutated your thread here into...well it's not what it was originally about. It might be better to move a conversation about who is an asshat to another thread so you can finish up your discussion here. But that's just an opinion.                        </div>

                            Okay.  I did a word search and reread this thread again.  Nobody in any of their posts actually said anyone else's opinions were stupid, dumb, moronic, or anything else.  Nobody.  What seems to be the problem is that some folks want people to disagree with them but also concede that their opinion is valid and has merit.  Why?  Not all opinions have merit.  Why do I (or anyone for that matter) have to append "but what you think is okay too" to every statement of disagreement I have?  Especially when I may believe that what you think is wrong.<br><br>Please, note that I'm not commenting at all on the original ideas put forth in this thread.  I'm commenting on what this thread has morphed into, which is some sort of defense for "Everyone's ideas are equal and should be respected."  I think that position is inherently faulty and really cannot be reasonably defended.<br><br>Still, that's probably a bit off topic for this forum, so I'll let it rest unless someone wants to debate it privately.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            -I didn't realize that I failed to clarify when I switched who I was talking to, sorry about that.  I thought I had until I re-read it.-<br><br> Here you go.<br><br>(and to  Matt_Snyder)<br>I'm not insulting you as much as I'm saying that what you did was insulting and uncalled for.  I'll highlight the points that make me believe this.<br>Why did you have to belittle his own words to say yours?
<blockquote><br/>Among other things, <b>it lets you maintain absurd judgments </b>about "pretty &amp; popular" people, assume that normal is "BORING &amp; MUNDANE," and maintains the idea that letting your geek flag fly loudly while also vocally urging "No I'm not cool because I'm a geek, I'm just cool because I'm alive" all while ignoring that it's precisely what those pretty and popular people, and BORNING &amp; MUNDANE people do to be happy in their lives. <b>You fail to self-recognize</b> that your extreme enthusiasm for the geek lifestyle is a judgment of other lifestyles<br/><br/>Finally, with this paragraph, <b>you indicate that you cannot separate role-playing the activity from role-playing the sub-culture of geeks</b>. Your language here makes it impossible to separate the two. One is either a gamer and a geek, or a person who doesn't enjoy gaming. (But they're still cool! Because we musn't judge ... and yet judge anyway!) I reject this assumption. This saves me the effort of having to demonstrate to people skeptical of my claims that this assumption exists among the gaming sub-culture. I can point right to your paragraph and shrug. </blockquote>
Those unnessisary comments turned what could have been a very constructive post into dirt-flinging the other person's beliefs to state your own, and stating your opinions of that person's idea as a fact.<br/><br/>I brought it up because I'd like to think you didn't mean to do that, but you did, and wanted to say something about it because I don't think was called for.<br/><br/>It didn't help the arguement that your first words were
<blockquote>Victor, you have just demonstrated why I want nothing to do with identifying as a geek</blockquote>
By starting with that, it really seemed to come off as your next words were belittling, (not because they were reasons you didn't to identify as a geek, because it makes perfect sense, considering your point of view on what a geek represents), but because your next words went on to call his idea absurd; which suggests that your opinion of what a geek represents what V is, AND that you see it as all the things you dissaprove of.<br/><br/>Did you mean to?  I doubt it.    Did everyone see the same as I did?  Doubtful, but I wasn't the only one to take it as you were attacking V.<br/><br/>It's not just you, you just happened to be the example I ended up using, most likely because you kept prodding me about not posting quotes when I talked about things and your post made a convenient one to quote and point out.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I don't see how this thread makes sense. You people disagree, and you disagree about the ways of disagreeing. This happens sometimes. Happens to me all the time with my parents, my brother and my best friends. We never use internet policies though and get all the time defensive, attack each other instead of the ideas and totally miss each others points. But at the end, we still love each other.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don't think disagreeing about almost everything is the real problem here, but an aspect of forum threads: they just never die if you don't let them.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm not trying to moderate, or lock a thread. Carry on if you want to, I just wanted to say this so you don't miss the fact that disagreeing (or even getting defensive, attacking each other, anything that's part of a nice bloody discussion) isn't the core of evil that will destroy the world, make this place somehow bad or anything like that.

                            I assume that whether you thought you were talking to Matt or me (this is about the third misatribution you've made to me), that you were, in fact responding to the last post I made.<br/>
<br/>
In either case, I find it hard to understand how you can say that calling people Asshats can be construed as: "...not insulting you as much as I'm saying that what you did was insulting and uncalled for"<br/>
<br/>
So, if I have this straight, when you use harsh language, it's OK, because somebody else did it first?<br/>
<br/>
Throughout this thread, you've had a very strong double-standard going. When you question something, it's just you "investigating" why people feel that way. When they question your ideas, they're trying to belittle you. You have an answer like this for every objection that comes up. And, strangely, your rhetoric becomes even stronger against people who are not participating in the thread over time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sara, I'm just a dumb RPG geek trying to figure things out. I'm not one lick smarter than you are, nor do I care to make myself look smarter than anyone. Nor, does Matt or anybody else here (as far as I can tell). All of this hand-wringing about how to comment to each other comes out of people reading intent into other's posts that everyone is denying is there.<br/>
<br/>
Now, being dumb, the only thing I can think to do to fix this is to not participate any longer. If you post a reply to this and want me to reply, indicate so - but if not, I'm going to leave it alone again. Because it's not, as far as I can tell, doing anyone any good.<br/>

                            Let's see what happens when the "Sink Thread" option is used.<br><br>Here's one thing that I'd like to note. Going to the original poster's main crux of the argument:
<blockquote>-what, and why- do you feel gaming is exclusive to non-gamers? there's alot of excitement about how to include non-gamers, but I'm not nessisarily certain I agree with why they are excluded. I don't think it has to do with complicated game matter, dice rolling, intricate systems or understanding the concept; I think it has to do with the attitude of "I'm not going to bother explaining this because you'll think it's stupid", from the gamer that causes the "but you'll think I'm stupid because I'm not a gamer...so I won't ask" I don't see that part being asked; and I'm interested in knowing why.</blockquote>
This was being discussed in numerous side threads (it's a huge amount of ideas rolled into a few sentences). However, it's is very poignantly being discussed in This Thread Over Here:<br><br><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2069" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2069</a><br><br/>See the conversation about "breaking out Contenders at a Christmas party".  I think the spirit of the thread has re-railed itself over there.<br/><br/>EDIT: SINK, turns out, is an awesome feature.  It basically takes the thread at the time of the sink, and doesn't pop to the top of the forum when new people post.  It's the equivalent of a bunch of mob guys throwing chains around a dude's legs and taking him for a harbor dive. It doesn't come back up for air.

Yup.  I've mixed up attributions before, too.  While in principle having pictorial icons beside the posts is supposed to help with this, it doesn't seem to help much for me.  Having people cuss me out for doing so didn't help either, though.  I think slowing down the dialogue and having more than two distinct sides helped me a lot.

I think we're mostly agreeing at this point.  I don't hold that relativist belief, and I agree that it is invalid.  However, <i>if</i> you want to engage in real dialogue with people who hold any beliefs, then you have to treat their beliefs with respect.  That is not the same thing as agreeing with them or saying that they are valid.  You can respectfully say that you disagree with that belief, and argue your case.  However, it does means not saying "That's stupid fucked up bullshit" or whatever.                        </div>
