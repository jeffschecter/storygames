You've got a cleric, he is about to cast Bless on a fighter. The situation dictates that success isn't automatic, so the cleric has to roll. Should this be an opposed roll [even though the fighter is willing] or a difficulty number? If I go opposed roll, what does the fighter use to determine dice?<br/><br/>In the system there is a rule [the fighter just wants to use the least amount of dice possible]: <br/><br/><i>'Want to try something but don\u2019t have the trade? No problem, pick up two dice and add them to the pool. Unfortunately, one of these will be a penalty die so the highest number rolled will have to be dropped.'</i><br/><br/>This means the fighter would roll 1D + 1P, and drop the highest die. The low score is what the cleric needs to meet or beat for a successful roll.<br/><br/>or the GM could assign a TN for the Bless spell. If the cleric rolls equal to, or higher than, the TN then the spell is successful.<br/><br/>Which method do you prefer, or is there better way to handle it?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384333/#Comment_384333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-04T23:30:46+00:00" title="July  4, 2012 11:30PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why does the situation decree that sucess or failure is interesting?

In fact, you often roll multiple dice for opposition.  If the die used for Cover is the highest result, then the bullet hits the wall.  If the die for Concealment is the highest result, then the shooter didn't even understand where the target was.  If the die for Dodge was highest rolled, then some super cool acrobatics, or some innate sense of incoming fire kept the defender safe.  etc.<br/><br/>Opposed rolls are more work for everyone, but they can give the narrative some fuel and flavor.  Maybe the fighter is distracted by the goblin's sword, maybe he accidentally brought his right palm higher than his left during the spell being cast, maybe his eyes looked South, maybe he recently disrespected a minor god who is paying him back.

Without even trying, just by getting Reflex boosters, etc. I could make a character that could dance their way through a firefight untouched. It was cool and over-the-top, but was not gritty at all.<br/>When CP2020 came out, the TN was a set number and a skill marksman could hit anyone, but you couldn't make a character that could reliably survive a fire fight without investing heavily in personal armor. These games were grittier, and in combat-heavy games, everyone ended up investing heavily in skinweave, subdermal armor and Kevlar trench coats.<br/>Hope that helps,<br/>Dave M<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384367/#Comment_384367" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-05T13:04:15+00:00" title="July  5, 2012  1:04PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the prospect of always having an opposed roll sounds good to you, there's always the Dogs in the Vineyard approach of having the "world" have dice to roll.
