Briefly, all conflicts in Thrones cause Injury.  Right now their are two types of Injury.  Wounds from being stabbed, punched, etc and Relationship Injuries from social conflicts.  When you take advantage of an injured relationship this called capitalizing on the injury.  You gain the injury's value as bonus dice on whatever it is you trying to do.  <br/><br/>However, you can bank up to *half* the value into some Stat, right now I'm calling it Vindication.  You can roll Vindication as a direct attack against a character's Ego.  The number of victories you score (the game uses Sorcerer's die pool system) subtract from the target's Ego.  However, if you fail to completely crush the target's Ego (i.e. reduce it to zero) you lose half your victories (rounded up) off your own Ego.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>(A) I'm not 100% happy with Vindication as the term for this score.  Any thoughts on this?<br/>(B) Right now I'm calling this special Ego attacking action The Master Stroke.  Not sure I like that either.  More thoughts?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The first alpha draft of the whole thing can be found <a href="http://bloodthornpress.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/thornesalpha1-0oct2009.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  But I'm already changing several significant things based on feedback I got here, over at The Forge and after a single playtest session.<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/><br/>Alphonse pushes forward a pile of money and says, \u201cBolville, bring me your daughter tonight.\u201d  Dice are rolled and Alphonse is the winner with two victories.  He decides to add an Injury to the relationship between Bolville and his daughter.  This Injury has a value of two.  This makes sense because Bolville has just been bribed to betray his daughter.<br/><br/>In a scene immediately, Clovis is meeting with Beatrice (Bollville\u2019s daughter).  He says to her, \u201cYou are a fool to be so loyal to your father!  He would sell you to that villain Alphonse like a common whore!\u201d in an attempt to get her to run away with him.  They roll dice and Clovis could add two dice because he is capitalizing on the Injury that Alphonse caused between Bollville and Beatrice in the previous scene, however, he decides to add just one die and bank the other die in Vindication.<br/><br/>Finally after a while Clovis has built up a Vindication score of six.  He's confronting Alphonse.  He says, "You're nothing but a coward who buys innocent women from their desperate fathers.  Leave this city in shame and never return."  Normally this would be a Ego + Dominance roll but Clovis declares that this action is his Master Stroke.  So he rolls his six Vindication dice instead against Alphonse's Ego + Dominance.<br/><br/>Let's say Alphonse's Ego is four.  If Clovis scores four victories or more then Alphonse's Ego is reduced to zero.  This called Crushing a Character's Ego and a whole bunch of other mechanics kick in.  If Clovis scores between one and three victories then Alphonse's Ego is still reduced by that amount but because he wasn't reduced to zero Clovis loses half those victories (rounded up) from his own Ego.  Finally, if Clovis fails to score any Victories at all then Alphonse may do a Reversal, which is to make a Vindication roll himself but without the fear of losing Ego himself if he only causes damage without crushing.  There's is no Reversing a Reversal.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
