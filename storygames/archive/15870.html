And that's great! But I also suspect there were other things at work that made it possible to have a successful game with this framework: Vampire tends to be highly political, and it's easy to imagine 2-3 core players being the main factional leaders, with the less-frequent attendees taking on specialist roles as needed.<br/><br/>What I want from this thread is a list of campaign ideas that would work with this structure where you invite a bunch of people to play, but privately know that only a core set of 2-3 of them are going to show up *every* week.<br/><br/>Besides politics, could a military missions style game work well here, where the hard core are the commanders? Or perhaps a Trek-style space exploration game, where your hard core are Kirk, Spock, and McCoy? Other ideas?<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360395/#Comment_360395" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-18T06:51:04+00:00" title="February 18, 2012  6:51AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Spymasters</b>: The core PCs are the core of the spy network, who relay intel and orders between Langley (or London, your call) and the agents on the ground.

Every week, though, you have Batman and Robin bringing the justice.

Because of the way advancement was set up (and because one player built his character as an XP-getting monster) the two main PCs had their fingers up the butts of most of the named NPCs. The contrast between the regular and the sometimes PCs was not so much power level (even if that existed) but the level of entanglement. NPCs would often turn to the sometimes PCs just because of their outsiderness because turning to the often PCs they'd get a whole lot of agenda and enemies and allies that might not want with it. Example:<br/><br/>The Maestro'D and Skinner are the informal rulers of Deepwater horizon having eliminated or subjugated every other power holder and are having a physical and psychic war with a biker gang. A smaller neighbouring village is scared as fuck (so small I don't even remember the same) and their militia sucks on all levels so they ask the Gunlugger for help getting it into shape because she is not an enemy of the bikers and she is also not the ex wife of the dam builders up stream they plan on fighting later on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360862/#Comment_360862" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T13:37:48+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  1:37PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff!!
