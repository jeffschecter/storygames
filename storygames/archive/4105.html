Look for a real session report soonish, but probably not until after Gateway.<br/><br/>So, LA Gamers representin'.  Mark was GM, Josh, Colin and I were players.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I have burning curiosities about how the game is meant to work, in the hopes that we can play it without drifting too far.  (First and biggest criticism: the text is opaque.  The systems look solid, and I think every question we had was answered by the text, but damned if it didn't take us a solid, uninterrupted 90 minutes to understand the 9 equations enough to make characters.  We have ideas for play aids, and layout and stuff.)<br/><br/>Okay, in some particular order:\n<ol>\n<li><b>PC Nemesises</b> Can a PC become the Nemesis of another PC?  Especially with Conmittance, where you could be suggesting fetishization into your nemesis visage, it seemed more than a little feasible.  Strategically it's interesting because as your potential Nemesis, I don't want to resist you.</li>\n<li><b>Slayings</b> Can I narrate the casual murder of otherwise unimportant NPCs?  Our ultimate reading was that technically, NPCs narrated in as scenery were pretty much player created Nobodies, and so real NPCs, and so would require an outright Slaying to kill, although that seemed weird in the context of evil cultists.  We realized after the fact that the NPC who did die was probably, yes, a Nobody, and that the Slaying rule probably meant that any of us could have demanded that Josh use a successful resolution to kill her, but none of us cared, so we let the killing go.  <i>Honto</i> or drift?</li>\n<li><b>Transendence and Terrenes</b> Mark's explanation, which we let lie, was that Terrenes are assumed to be Earthly locations, and as such, Temporal transendance  can reach all the other Terrenes, but Cosmic can meet other Cosmic transcendants but not reach other Terrenes.  Correct?</li>\n<li><b>Conflicts not with requested NPC</b>  (hypothetically) I call for a scene with a Teacher.  Mark frames the dinner party example (and maybe the example treats on this question) from the book, with a Teacher and many Rivals.  Can I go from a successful Teacher Resolution, and use my newfound Clarity to resolve against a Rival?  Can I take a lonely scene with just a Teacher, and turn from a successful resolution to a resolution with a Nobody that I narrate into the scene?  How much of that it kosher?</li>\n<li><b>GM's Role</b> Finally, what's the GM trying to accomplish?  I got a very "you know, GMmy kind of things" vibe from the book, but maybe there's a better explanation.</li>\n</ol>\nLet me go into more detail on the last question.  The GM's powers give him the ability to severely monkey-wrench the strategies of the players, since if I call for a scene with a Rival, I might get an NPC, I might get a weaker PC, or I could get thrown up against the leader, who could have double my power.  It seemed like part of the strategy for requesting scenes involves the GM presenting a sort of evil genius to be played against - I carefully construct a situation where there's only the one Victim that I want, so that I know what I'm getting when I call for a Victim scene - and some of it requires that the GM be enabling.  Mark played several NPCs as incredibly solicitous, in an effort to goad us to higher action (dismally unsuccessful), which wound up being completely counter our strategic intentions of finding conflicts to roll against.<br/><br/>And really, in a lot of ways, the stance the GM takes colors a lot of the rest of my questions.  For example, if the GM twists scene requests as much as possible, then I have an incentive to kill off difficult NPCs, and the other players have an incentive to require me to Slay them.  If terrenes are less reachable, they have more of an incentive to stand in the way, since the difficulty only exists for their opponent.  <br/><br/>Like I said, most of these questions have answers that can be teased from text, but it's difficult and uncertain work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91962/#Comment_91962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T20:29:33+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  8:29PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 8:32PM by Josh Roby.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like our eventual interpretation of Slaying -- it's only a Slaying if that NPC is removed from the game and their Purpose and Agency can no longer be used.

I was gm so I was always in the scenes<br/>2. it was midnight when we ended the recording so I'm not sure who said what about which as we were trailing off. But we're all planning to play another session this week or next so we'll see what we think deeper into the game. Personally I really like the subject matter, the five layers of npcs and players elevating/lowering/draining them, protagonizing npcs with soul questions, the various fallout that stikes the pcs, and the results of a challenge to the existing dark god. Games where players have to simultaneously think strategically while also contributing to a story tend not to be my favorite as a player, so I'm not sure how I would have felt if I were playing rather than gming. <br/><br/>In your faq you mention that some other people had questions about the gm's role. I was comfortable framing scenes centered on npcs, and trying to contribute to a rising spiral of occult malevolence, but I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing vis a vis the players' competition. Was I suppose to frame scenes to allow each player to advance their strategic goals; try to keep the game balanced by helping some players and making things difficult for the leader; act fully as opposition and make it hard for all players to get the right kinds of npcs in their scenes; or ignore that aspect of the game? I'd lean towards the first or last option.<br/><br/>One other thing. I've been reading Roberto Bolano's novel<i>The Savage Detectives</i> this week (partly about the 'visceral realists,' a literary movement in 1970s mexico city, and it struck me that Acts of Evil could easily model young artists striving within the hothouse atmosphere of an avant garde. The npc hierarchy could stay the same...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92868/#Comment_92868" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T23:37:37+00:00" title="September  3, 2007 11:37PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>1.

I think some mechanic or procedure that knitted the significance of scenes together may help -- so that what Colin is doing in his scene directly impacts me in some meaningful way.  Right now, the common pool of NPCs is a rather weak way of accomplishing this.  (Of course, us only having one NPC in each scene may have something to do with it being 'weak'.)<br/><br/>2. That was me, and it was specifically in response to Mark framing me opposite lizard-men.  I'll get back to you after another session if it's my impression of the game as a whole.

I think I correctly read a dubious reaction to Ron's thoughts, and I think you're mostly right to be dubious.  Ron's position (which I'd be happy to see clarified) seemed to be that standard PTA scene framing doesn't work for AoE, and that something different is required.  Mark grasped that immediately, and went one better, by framing scenes by starting with the NPC in question going about their daily lives until the shadow of a PC fell across them.  PC occultists were always introduced with a sort of ellipsis: "...short on food and money, and with a new baby on the way, Sofia walks into the overseers office.  He glances up from his work..."  (Granted, we did occasionally have to call for Mark to roll dice though...)<br/><br/>Did we ask specifically: "who calls for rolls?"  We did have this ongoing issue of acquiescent NPCs, which meant we were afloat a little in some of our scenes.<br/><br/>Finally, scene framing aside, the selection of NPCs, when it's up to the GM, is a completely open question.  I don't know that there needs to be a mechanic for which NPCs to select or whatnot, but the GM's choice is significant, and at present entirely unguided.  The players have a clear goal: transcend to Anathema, jack up Clarity, collect a whole bunch of power, and become a god.  <br/><br/>The GM's goal is less clear, and my suspicion (which I hope will be forgiven) is a sort of underlying assumption about "what GMs do" that doesn't hold for a game as basically different as <i>Act of Evil.</i>  The GM has the tools to accomplish several disparate goals, and even words to the effect that all of them are acceptable, from balancing the field to the mischievous glee of a genie, would be really helpful.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>1. Did you find yourself interested in the scenes the other players were having, even though your occultist wasn't present? And if so, what do you think was holding your interest?</blockquote>\nI for one was interested in other player's scenes.  I'm actually a little amused by Josh describing them as (and I'm paraphrasing while I jibe) "mere color."  I don't think we crossed over NPCs enough, or engaged the concommitance and ligatures mechanics enough, but I suspect that that was a consequence of us learning the 9 equation mechanics, etc.  \n<blockquote>2. You end the recording with a clip of someone saying, "That was kind of weird. I'm not sure if I enjoyed it." Was that said in response to the Acts of Evil session?

The more I reflect on our last session, the more I like what happened, and the more I'm interested in seeing what comes of future sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93049/#Comment_93049" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T18:22:06+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  6:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MERE COLOR!<br/><br/>Seriously, I took the others' scenes more as guidelines as to what I could do in my upcoming scene than anything that directly impacted me or my character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93246/#Comment_93246" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T14:54:13+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  2:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still of the belief that the first session almost necessarily plays out that way, since we're all kind of establishing ourselves and our occult circles.  Starting next session, it seems like we should be running across the NPCs we each created.  Poor Galena, the Purpose 3, Agency 2 Victim seems like she should should get several visits, for instance.  And we've got Rivals all over the place.<br/><br/>I'm definitely seeing some Tufte influenced graphs in the final book, Paul, between the interactions of the 9 equations, and the relative relationships of characters ("If X is my Underling, and I'm you're Underling, what is X to you?") I'm imagining one big wall chart on the order of Tufte's representation of the Napoleonic wars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93249/#Comment_93249" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T15:12:56+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  3:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            also more use of the suggestion mechanic (I forget its name) to keep everyone engaged in scenes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93257/#Comment_93257" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T15:50:55+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  3:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: markv</cite>also more use of the suggestion mechanic (I forget its name) to keep everyone engaged in scenes</blockquote>\nYes, but that engagement, I think, will make most sense when what happens in another players scene matters to me.  <br/><br/>Here's an example and a wacked out question in one: In the course of another player's scene, I make a serious suggestion that he declines.

I just haven't quite wrapped my head around it yet. So I have more questions than answers. How does an NPC "doing something normal" not become a floaty and not-particularly-interesting scene if the GM's choice of details doesn't inspire the player? (I'm thinking here of your described lizard-man scene. Would you have had more fun with it if you'd been able to invent your own intrusion upon events?)  I've asked Ron to do a play-by-play of a scene from the Gen Con playtest on the Ashcan Front thread. I'm hoping it helps. And the "shadow of an PC" falling across the NPC is certainly in keeping with the game text. But I guess the question is whether a method where the GM leaves things more open for the player to inject his character will work better...<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93277/#Comment_93277" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T17:36:04+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  5:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I'd <i>love</i> to have a Tufte style graphic in the book.

And then for gameplay to derail the competitive emotional momentum by putting a story arc around maybe a half handful of the NPCs. The GM's job is to manage that landscape. But if I were exactly sure how to instruct the GM to do that moment-to-moment, the game wouldn't be an ashcan.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been thinking a lot about the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4073#Item_27" rel="nofollow">advice I gave Tony</a> on his "Turning the volume down from 11" thread. I'm thinking in Acts of Evil the player is all about positioning himself for the future. And the GM needs to focus on the details. A player's turn is a Hellboy-esque micro-story built from a series of die rolls and outcomes. The GM's job is be the landscape of detail and NPCs invested in those details, into and among which the player character comes as a distortion.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd love to see your diagrams.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93526/#Comment_93526" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T12:55:24+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 12:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br><br>That kind of helps.  Maybe I (and we as table) need to chew on that idea some more, but maybe it'll help both of us if I frame the question a little differently.<br><br>As a player, the forward looking, drunk on special effects comes through clearly.  And it comes through because I can look at my character sheet, and the 9 equations, and see that (Aha!  I need more Aspect, and to get there I need more Power, so:) "I'm calling for a scene with a Victim."  And I prepare to chase down poor Galena in the form of a 500 pound white wolf.<br><br>But in the GMs chair, there's less clarity.  Mark was doing a great job at taking requests for Teachers and Nobodies and coming up with brand new characters, for the most part.  I think, maybe, that the lizard men resulted from an envy of our special effect budget.  <br><br>But!  Between the choice of existing characters, and the way NPCs are portrayed, the GM has some huge strategic tools.  Given a call for a Nobody, does he invent one, or present the Agency 4/Purpose 6 near-protagonist?  Does the amount of Power that the calling PC has influence that decision?  In the scene, should he withhold conflict until presented with the over the top special effects he wants to see?<br><br>As players, we're not sure how to read the GMs part in our machinations.  Sure, we can go to someone else's favorite victim (or just the ones in the home Terrene just after Transcending time) and give them a whopping agency.  But we can't guarantee which Victims the GM will present to the other Occultists.  We know what our opponents are striving for, the same way we can look across a chessboard and infer what Black wants.  <br/><br/>So, the GM has the biggest strategic tools, and he's a complete wild card, even to himself.  "Focus on the present moment" is a start to giving him a direction, but I'd like to hear something more.<br/><br/>I don't think that a mechanical pressure to choose NPCs is required, but some sort of goals that those choices serve might be.  As an example: "to keep the competition going: drag back the leader, make things easier on the back of the pack" or "you're own malicious entertainment at the expense of your players" would both be fine goals to pursue, and neither need be universal across tables.  <br/><br/>Is any of that making sense?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93559/#Comment_93559" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T15:19:28+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  3:19PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2007 3:21PM by markv.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the lizard men came from rolling location swamp and perversion idolatry; I also was lurching Josh's character through time because she was the first to rise, and I wanted to experiment with the temporal power, so I sent her forward to mingle with rich russian emigres in contemporary london, then way back to primordial wherever to contest for worshipers with a toad god<br/><br/>On the broader issue of framing scenes, I felt like I presented the npcs and <b>implied</b> the evil act that the characters would visit upon them by showing the npc in a bind or having a desire that could be crushed or in a subordinate position that could be abused.

The text advises the GM to frame the player character directly into conflicts as an antagonist, but lately I'm finding myself retreating from that advice.

And it's not the games we play, either. Some people just go all flat-footed when they have to keep their ball rolling. If this is simply not the game for them, well then it's not, but it would be fair to warn people of that. <br/><br/>I am curious, because I have yet to see or get enough money to purchase the ashcan: Is there a lot of advice regarding how to make a character <i>specifically for</i> Acts of Evil? If there's anything that can get people revved-up thinking about their characters and what their characters want to do and <b>why</b> they want to do it, that will give the players a handy track to ride on when creativity takes an unexpected bathroom break. So far as I know, that's the only help i can think of to get people focused on their characters and their character's strategy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94447/#Comment_94447" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T14:44:39+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  2:44PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>There may be some tricks a GM could use to inspire a player to antagonism.

A resistant NPC was all we needed to antagonize against, because we were actively rewarded for finding the conflict.  <br/><br/>Our biggest procedural difficulty was that NPCs were incredibly acquiescent to our unpleasant demands.  From Mark's perspective, he was trying to drive us to use more flashy occult powers, by simply yielding to us.  From ours, the conflicts we set out to turn into mechanical rewards were folding.  We'd get everything we wanted fictionally, and then had nowhere to go mechanically.<br/><br/>The more I reflect on the tactic of non-resistance, and on the phrase "small and squalid," it seems that the GM should alway present resistance from the NPCs, but not allow rolls for actions that aren't satisfying.  For instance, we used a lot of Voice as command and force of will, and I could see how Mark would want more from us than that.  But A:.O:.E:. (of course that's how it's initialized!) isn't <i>Dogs</i>: "Say yes or roll dice" doesn't work, quite.  It's almost "Roll dice when I say yes" or "Say no until you roll dice."   Which is really weird, as I think of it.<br/><br/>As to the GM keeping things interesting, that's reasonable advice.  I can see now how I was just having a hard time hearing it as an answer to my question.  But in terms of player strategy, it provides an additional dimension.  In order to make your pitfall NPCs viable tactics, you need to interest the GM in them.  Of course, a solid Soul's Desire goes a long way towards that, but so does helping to build a solid narrative for the Victim or Nobody in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98549/#Comment_98549" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T06:53:11+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  6:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 6:53AM by PaulCzege.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Judson, Joshua, Mark,<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I'd like to talk about it:<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n"Our biggest procedural difficulty was that NPCs were incredibly acquiescent to our unpleasant demands.

In My Life with Master the scenes are scoped by type of conflict, so scenes have some roleplaying and the group just watches for the relevant conflict.

I don't know what to do with the "when to roll" question, though.  As a for instance, my transcendence scene started with Josh's Underling in the desert, and before Mark could frame me in, I threw in a sandstorm that Oleg had conjured up in order to isolate his rival.  In retrospect I think I should have called for a roll right there, but it wasn't until it came down to a battle of wills that we actually had a roll.<br><br>You know what's dumb?  I wonder if a section along the lines of "Your Occult Powers and You" might not help.

Other times ithe conflict wasn't "interesting" enough for me to want to slow down and roll dice. Other times I anticipated, based on how I framed the scene, how the pc would mess with the npc and I was waiting for something similar to my vision to take place to roll - and accordingly I had a blind spot towards other conflicts that the players sought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99804/#Comment_99804" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T13:08:11+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  1:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a paradigm-shifty email conversation with Ron on this topic, and if you're interested I've excerpted the juice <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ashcanfront.net/forums/?CommentID=128" rel="nofollow">here</a> on the "[Acts of Evil] knowing when to roll the dice" thread at the Ashcan Front forums.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99832/#Comment_99832" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T14:42:40+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  2:42PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, we finished last night (I won!) and with last session's audio still on my to-do list, I have over two hours of audio to edit down to something sensible.
