If you're making a generic ruleset based on Lady Blackbird, the game should probably build up a situation and tension as an integral part of the characters' makeup. The whole process should feel like pulling on a rubber band until it gets tighter, tighter, tighter and then you let go, which is where play begins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241868/#Comment_241868" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T10:31:34+00:00" title="November 13, 2009 10:31AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>There's a logic to how the characters are built and pointed at one another.

But still.<br><br>You can definitely see how the characters in Lady Blackbird aren't just a random band of adventurers. They're charged up with intrapersonal conflicts. Plus the game starts in the middle of a tense, dramatic situation.<br><br>So you could make chargen rules for Lady Hackbird (whatever) ... but you'd need more than just stuff like three Keys, five Traits, etc. You'd have to make those intrapersonal conflicts and dramatic starting situations part of the mechanics.<br><br/>For example: One (1) Trait must revolve positively around another PC. One (1) Trait must revolve negatively around another PC. One (1) Trait must explain the character's past. Etc. <br/><br/>You could do the whole thing yourself, like Jason did for his Bloody Forks of the Ohio hack (which I really dig, and have put into the long, long queue of games my group is gonna play). But with chargen rules that captured that stuff, it could become a group activity that would be part of the game.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Blackbird and its descendants NEEDS this, but if someone wanted to do it for their own game, there's probably a way to do it right.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241905/#Comment_241905" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T15:53:11+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  3:53PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the strengths of Lady Blackbird and her descendants is that all the characters are pregenerated by the same person.

Too many interesting thoughts coalescing already.<br/><br/>About Conditions:<br/>A condition is a fictional situation that constrains what you're allowed to say about your character. It's a cue to tell the GM and players to pay attention to that thing and use it as material for the developing fiction. Gaming is just us saying stuff to each other, yeah? So you're like, "What do I say now?" and you look down and go, "Oh, I'm angry. I'll go be angry at someone then. 'Snargle! Why is my bridge full of chicken feathers?!'"<br/><br/>For the GM, the conditions represent permissions. "They throw manacles on you and toss you back in the brig," would be a fight normally, but no, you're Trapped, so there's permission. And I mean <i>permission to say a thing is true</i>, not some kind of required mechanical thing like "When someone is Trapped for two rounds without removing the Trapped condition, move them to the brig." Gah.<br/><br/>That's how I use them. There are other ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242097/#Comment_242097" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T20:57:55+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  8:57PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2009 8:58PM by Judd.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stops to making a Lady Hackbird of your very own:\n<ol>\n<li>Decide on Color/Genre/Vibe -&gt; some setting<br/><br/></li><li>Situation -&gt; more setting<br/><br/></li><li>Characters thrown together under duress (see above, situation) -&gt; even more setting<br/><br/></li><li>Keys, Secrets (see characters) -&gt; some more setting tossed in<br/><br/></li><li>Conditions (same as in Lady Blackbird?)<br/><br/></li><li>John Harper creates a beautiful map and hand-out<br/><br/></li><li>Put out for free on the internet for play.<br/></li>\n</ol>\nThat about sums it up, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242102/#Comment_242102" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T21:35:37+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  9:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think conditions are more an overview of the most likely things that will happen to your character.

A generic Lady Hackbird with some character generation.<br/><br/>I also rearranged it a bit for "fluency play" (and so it's easier to play over Skype or IRC) - there's a basic version I called "meat"--which fits on a page--and then you can layer additional rules up on top as you go.  <br/><br/>I also took out some stuff (keys and secrets) with a much slimmer "flags" rule in its place - but I put it on the story games wiki, so you can put that stuff right back in as optional / advanced rules if you want.  <br/><br/>And just last week I finally got a chance to playtest.

I didn't kill the magic!  <br/><br/>I called it "Blackbird Pie".<br/><br/>And here it is:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Blackbird_Pie" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Blackbird_Pie</a><br/><br/>What do you guys think?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294686/#Comment_294686" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-26T18:27:16+00:00" title="September 26, 2010  6:27PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294731/#Comment_294731" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T06:32:57+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  6:32AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that I'll try to use this as one of the games I pitch for our next group game.
