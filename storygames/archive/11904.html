Life has just been getting in the way of any gaming, so I missed out on the entire playtest thing. Which for those of you that know me isn\u2019t a big surprise. But the game, demands to be played, so we finally got to.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a<i> first session</i> that sort of stretched over two sessions because of lack of prep by me. But that didn\u2019t really matter cause we got some magic Apocalytica moments out of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy players and characters where:<br/>\n<b>C \u2013 Keeler (gunlugger)</b>, your standard guntoting post apoclytic paranoid psycho. But I am getting under his skin. Fave conversation:<br/>\nWhat does the memories of your father\u2019s face make you feel like?<br/>\nNothing, nothing but good. All the other shit has been washed away by the blood of others.<br/>\n<b>M \u2013 Scarlet (battlebabe),</b> the bombshell with a soft spot, assault rifle and a sharp sword. And I am really getting my hooks into this one. Fave moment:<br/>\nSeduces Shade just to rub E\u2019s face in the fact that the Skinners sex move doesn\u2019t faze a battlebabe.<br/>\n<b>E \u2013 Shade (skinner)</b>, the man-whore that doesn\u2019t want to be a man-whore. Just learned what fucking someone may do for him, so this is going to be good. Fave moment:<br/>\nWhen E realizes the power of a Skinner\u2019s sex move.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Session one.</b><br/>\nWe were going to be me and four players, ended up being me and two, C and M. We watched Bitch Slap, made characters, talked a bit and began rolling. Got into the groove pretty quickly when M said she wanted Scarlet to have a chopper.<br/>\nME - \u201cdoes it say in your playbook that you start out with one?\u201d<br/>\nM - \u201ceh \u2026 no.\u201d<br/>\nME - \u201cthen you don\u2019t have one.\u201d<br/>\nM - \u201cbut I want one\u201d<br/>\nC - \u201cso we are going shopping?\u201d<br/>\nME - \u201cwho are you going to take it from, there is a Chopper gang\u201d<br/>\nM - \u201cNah, but there was this guy that fucked me over a week ago. Figure he owes me.\u201d<br/>\nME - \u201cKeeler, you going to tag along?\u201d<br/>\nC - \u201cSure.\u201d<br/>\nFrom this conversation on things got interesting. The Hold of Bunker Bay was explored, we established a few sets (Ba\u2019s Fish, Machinery Beach and Monk\u2019s Den) and a lot of NPCs, though few with a true agenda, the only ones was Grome\u2019s family (Brute: Family).<br/>\nThe Shopping trip ended in Keeler blowing Grome\u2019s little brother to bits, and then when they came back to get their own back Grome was smoked by a sniping Keeler. Sorta like this:<br/>\nScarlet is tricking out her new Chopper when Grome, Rufe and Dog Head surround her to extract vengeance for their little brother. Scarlet dodges a shotgun blast and gets the hell out of Dodge on the chopper. Meanwhile Keeler\u2019s been on a rooftop nearby watching Scarlet through his rifle scope. C was intentionally vague why Keeler was doing this, leaving our dirty little minds to fill in the blanks. Anyhoo, he blows Grome\u2019s top of, and the two others leg it.<br/>\nThe kid that got killed got a name and was the Hold\u2019s savvy head. Which left the Hold in a bind, him being dead and all. Monk sent the duo to make right by \u201crecruiting\u201d a savvy head from a nearby cult hold called Messiah Ward.<br/>\nI was getting my Apoc groove on. So the Brethren was nice and twisted. They got captured because of "lets try talking to them" sort of handed me their butts on a platter, freed by a deviant and apostate monk called Twice, when promised sex led them out, leaving them with two more NPCs (Twice the Twisted and the savant 13 years old savvy head Jeanette). We ended there, all stoked.<br/>\n<br/>\nSession two introduced Shade.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had all been drinking heavily the night before, and me being a slut hadn\u2019t slept much. So we really were slow getting in the mood. So there was no prep except a few vague ideas about bringing the Brethren to Bunker Bay.<br/>\nBut eventually things got rolling, with Rufe and Dog Head doing security for the Brethren missionary, bringing along some bodies from the Pain Boi chopper gang. Some poor planning and fuckery got Shade beaten up, Rufe had his nut-sack cut in two, and allowed me to introduce Imam, the Angel, which immediately developed an agency (and Shade owes him about 3 barter). Scarlet used the chance to seduce the doped up Skinner.<br/>\n"Any particular reason why?"<br/>\n\u201cHey, I got to fuck someone pretty for once.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nTwice was sniffing around Jeanett, who developed a need for him, much to Scarlet\u2019s dismay. So she was trying to protect this little girl, with Keeler going Aggro on Twice, making him both piss himself and at the same time turning the freak on. Moving the little girl to her den (an APC wreck ahlf buried in a ruined house).<br/>\nWord around the hold was that Cache (of the Pain Boi crew) was shooting his mouth about how they had stomped Shade and that his muscle (the other two) were to pussy to do anything about this. Keeler didn\u2019t want to let this stand, but the other two wanted to focus on the Brethren. Keeler staked out the Chopper stronghold. Kinda like this:<br/>\n\u201cI note everything down in my plan book. Fantasizing about how the attack is going to go. Imagining the details. Compare it to watching porn and having sex. Tantalizing, but not as good as real thing.\u201d<br/>\nWe stopped before the attack. Leaving it for next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time we just moved with the flow. At the times we called for dice they did just what they were supposed to do. And by now I have three to four potential Fronts, and enough good shit to keep the homefront cooking at high heat. So next time it is going to be Pain Rain for all it is worth.<br/>\nIt has been to long since I\u2019ve actually have spent time getting to know the characters before rolling into \u201cthrill-mode\u201d. And just getting to do this again was sweet. And Apoc World really shines when you get into campaing mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can\u2019t wait to play this game again.  It is love at first roll.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265834/#Comment_265834" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T16:50:02+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  4:50PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was fun to read.

I really hate the fact that it is ages until next time we get to play (sunday the earliest).<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't wait to see what happens with:<br/>\nDog Head is all out of family, she won't jsut go away and die though.<br/>\nThe Brethren's untouchable mission.<br/>\nWill Pain Boi be driven from Bunker Bay?<br/>\nAnd what does Imam want with the Brethren's brain control drug?<br/>\nAnd on the homefront there is<br/>\nH's ambition.<br/>\nJeanett needs Twice, but the crew don't approve<br/>\nWisher hates Keeler for not falling for her.<br/>\nAnd the others, like Monk just waiting to explode.<br/>\n<br/>\nApoc world is funny in that way. Just by following the principles and you get all these characters ready to fuck the character's lives to bits. It gets kinda hard holding back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, Skinners are just too cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
