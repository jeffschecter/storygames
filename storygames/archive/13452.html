Like maybe they can get or lose something on their character sheet or die pool instead of having a cool in-game fictional consequence.  And let's further suppose that this is mistaken - that if they really knew the strategy for the game, they'd realize that that's a bad play...<br/><br/>What's weird is, even though they're wrong, that's now the way they're going to play.  Maybe it's bad strategy, and maybe they'll learn that after several repeated plays, but until then, they're going to be saying a lot of, "Nah, I'll take the quatloos instead of contributing to the fiction."<br/><br/>Let's further suppose that this makes the game lame for those first few plays before they learn the strategy.  (With a board game, accidentally incentivizing the wrong thing isn't as damaging as it is for an RPG - it can just become part of the game.)  Let's suppose the game designer put that mechanic in precisely to encourage people to do the opposite of what they're doing.  <br/><br/>Like the day care center that accidentally incentivized parents to pick up their kids late by charging fines for the lateness, a game mechanic can backfire.<br/><br/>And just as, in the real world, there are all kinds of incentives that aren't monetary, there must be all kinds of story game incentives that aren't mechanical or mathematical.<br/><br/>What are they?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303333/#Comment_303333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T15:29:34+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  3:29PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the combination of your thread title, your description (which is really confusing) and your question about incentives here...

A story game is about making sure something interesting happens regardless of the choices made or dice rolled. <br/><br/>as for non "mechanical" rewards i can identify these<br/><br/>1. attention (it's my turn to talk, maybe people will listen)<br/><br/>2. validation (people listened and have incorporated what I said into what they are saying now)<br/><br/>3. yes (you got something you wanted)<br/><br/>4. but (did not get something you wanted)<br/><br/>5. flavor text (light sabers are totally sweet!)<br/><br/>6. great art (wow my wookiee looks awesome)<br/><br/>Story game mechanics are all about making sure those rewards happen on a regular basis. The resources in play are there to create some freedoms and make sure stuff concludes right.<br/><br/>However let me blow your mind<br/><br/>Star wars epic duels is possibly the most forward thinking miniatures game released to this day. It's mechanics are perfectly enjoyable for novice players, BUT! players who understand the game's mechanics have games that start to mimic the pacing of actual   fight scenes in the star wars movies. The action has natural pauses that contrast with moments of intense fighting, it's great! but even still it's really fun for novice players.<br/><br/>The skilled play of epic duels encourages a deeper more interesting narrative.<br/><br/>Why use skill? because skill and strategy are very deep wells of implicit rules that each player can learn or not learn at their own pace. The trick is to make the game interesting or fun while not requiring strategy. Strategy is it's own reward, better performance should always lead to more complex and layered problems, not simply higher numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303373/#Comment_303373" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T01:00:02+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  1:00AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's value in designing something to be fun while learning/before you figure out strategy/how to play (a lot of games need more of the opposite: fun after you figure out how to play).

Just as, as a GM, it is perfectly valid to set up the game so that if the players don't play it "correctly" the game will crash and burn.
