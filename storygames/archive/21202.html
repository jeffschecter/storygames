There will be<br/>- 2 adult facilitators<br/>- ca. 10-12 teenagers<br/>- 3x 3hour time-slots throughout a week.<br/><br/>Can you recommend <i>specific</i> games for this context? It can be i.e. 2hour game + intro/briefing and debriefing. It can also be several smaller games.<br/>There is no specific educational or moral agenda, so it can also just be fun (a life-positive vibe may be good).<br/>Please no general references ("check out golden cobra anthology") or vague anecdotes ("was at this nordic convention once...") but specific references we can use.<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464611/#Comment_464611" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-05T00:24:03+00:00" title="July  5, 2017 12:24AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting situation you've got there - a fruitful frame, you should be able to fit a nice little mini-campaign of something wonderful in there. I would write my own game for this thing, were I in your stead. Would you like to brainstorm/crowdsource something, or would you rather hunt down the perfect game for this? Larp-ish things aren't difficult to design as long as you stick to the conventional, but there's some work involved in writing up the characters. The advantage would be getting to tailor your subject matter and style and such for the situation.<br/><br/>Also, a relevant general question: when you say larp, do you mean something relatively stately, with players talking to each other and maybe playing rock-paper-scissors, or would athletic elements fit in as well? Boffer swordfighting is a larp favourite in particular around here, but I understand that there's plenty of local cultures where it'd be very of out of place.<br/><br/>Another pin-down question: do you have an idea of what sort of creative emphasis the players would enjoy? Competitive play, atmospheric thespian thing, open-ended creativity?<br/><br/>And one last pin-down: what's the venue like? If the game was something more larp-ish, would there be e.g. multiple rooms to conduct the game in?<br/><br/>The reason I'm asking about the details is that I'm hoping to jog somebody into realizing that they've got the perfect game for you. I might have something, for instance, but then again they might be shitty recommendations after all. I'll think on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464624/#Comment_464624" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-05T19:54:46+00:00" title="July  5, 2017  7:54PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/><br/>So, I'd prefer ready to play specific recommendations - unless someone has a very exciting idea. Sure, I can come up with something. Generally, I tend to think that a game that has been developed over time and <i>proven</i> to really work well would be good.<br/><br/>The games would be based on conversation and improvisation. Less randomizers and certainly <i>no</i> swordfighting. Physical interaction is possible yet should be playful, not competitive. <br/><br/>Competition is less a focus unless it adds some intrinsic momentum to the game. The games should be encouraging empathy and enjoyment, I guess.<br/><br/>If the weather is nice, we can play in the forest. Else, we have one or several classrooms we can use.<br/><br/>Things I can imagine:<br/>- Werewolf (villagers try to find werewolves and frame each other)<br/>- Self-help group for superheroes (forgot the name)<br/><br/>I also once did a cultural sensitivity event where we played several tribes. Each tribe communicated with gestures. Each tribe had certain things they got them excited and taboos that greatly offended them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464625/#Comment_464625" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-05T20:39:54+00:00" title="July  5, 2017  8:39PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A trimmed-up Werewolf game would make for a good, simple larp, yeah. A bit of work, though - I'm not aware of a ready-made version. It would basically revolve around individualized character motivations and rules for secret murder and investigating such. I would personally enjoy "blowing up" the boardgame's premise a lot - like, nobody knows how many werewolves there even are, or if the whole thing's just a witch hunt cooked up for somebody's benefit.<br/><br/>Another semi-simple idea would be to do a <i>Diplomacy</i> larp. Roughly similar amount of work overall in prep, I'd say.<br/><br/>More usefully, I believe that Shreyas Sampat's <a href="https://elizabethsampat.itch.io/mist-robed-gate" rel="nofollow">Mist-Robed Gate</a> could make a good chassis for this. I am not entirely happy with its accessibility (there is a bit of a learning curve with the rules), but provided that he facilitators get the rules and the players get the genre, it would fit the time-frame, number of players and other constraints well. (The milieu could be turned e.g. European easily enough, too, if that part doesn't work.)<br/><br/>Another game that similarly hits the design constraints (time-frame, larp-y, large number of players, short-campaign potential) yet causes similar challenges in accessibility is my own <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/julkaisut/julenius" rel="nofollow">Fellows of the Julenius Archive</a>. I wouldn't mention it here weren't ready-made designs for this space somewhat sparse, as it has a double fault in being set in and being about Finland, and also being more suited to experienced roleplayers than newcomers. Still, it would work fine if one put in the work to adapt it to the local milieu and did a good job in facilitating it.<br/><br/>Both of those are available for free at their respective websites, I think, so perhaps you'll take a look and tell us what you think? Not necessarily because those solve your problem (I would like a game for teens to be more immediately intuitive), but because we might get some clues as to what direction to think about. I've got the feeling that a surprisingly well-fitting game is probably out there, I just can't think of it right this moment.<br/><br/>In general, though, there should be more games in this design space; I like it, it deserves more attention. I imagine that many people have stuff for it in their private files, but at least in my own case it's too Finnish (as in, I can't be bothered to translate my old con scenarios), too adult (negative horror stuff, cerebral wargamey things) or too sporty (boffer games and such). Surely somebody's made a simple and immediately grabbing game for this purpose...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464635/#Comment_464635" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-06T03:25:02+00:00" title="July  6, 2017  3:25AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2017 3:34AM by BeePeeGee.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the two recommendations.
