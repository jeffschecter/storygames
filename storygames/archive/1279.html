                    Hi.<br/><br/>I'm still confused by the TR/CR distinction. I think it's about classifying mechanics, right? <br/><br/>So we can say: "This mechanic is CR." Mechanics are the objects for the comparison.<br/><br/>So what is the compared quality?<br/><br/><br/>(Edit: Used completely wrong term "tertium comparationis". Sorry.)                </div>

                            You just want to make us look up <i>tertium comparationis</i>, don't you?!<br/>
<br/>
I think you have it backward. The <i>tertium comparationis</i> is the thing that they have in common. Task Resolution and Conflict Resolution have in common that they are systems for resolving things.<br/>
<br/>
The <i>object of comparison</i> is the thing they do differently. What is that thing? It's hard to say -- I don't think anyone has ever nailed it down definitively. We just know it when we see it.<br/>
<br/>
I think of it like so: Conflict Resolution resolves stuff I care about. Task Resolution resolves stuff I don't care about, in hopes that an aggregate of such stuff will somehow resolve what I <i>do</i> care about.                        </div>

                            I don't think it's a matter of good or bad.  It's a matter of whether you're resolving intent as well as action.<br><br>CR: You state your intent (and possibly actions). There is an identifiable conflict, i.e., someone (or something) works against your intent.  You go through the CR system, which might be one roll (e.g., scene resolution) or several (e.g., HeroQuest's extended conflicts).  Your intent will be resolved one way or another.  No trying the same thing again.<br><br>Example: I want to find incriminating evidence on you.  We go through the system.  Either I find the evidence, or I do not.  Once we agree to have a conflict about it, however, both are possibilities (the GM can't say, "You win the conflict but there's no evidence"--you cannot violate the intent I won).<br/><br/>TR: You state a task that a character performs.  You go through the TR system, which might be one roll or multiple (but tends to be one).  Your task will be resolved.  The intent may or may not be resolved.<br/><br/>Example: I want to crack this particular safe.  My intent might be to get evidence, or I may just be curious what's in there.  If I succeed, the safe's open.  If not, it's not.  Can I try again?  Maybe, maybe not.  If I get it open, there's no guarantee that my *intent* is satisfied.  Maybe there's evidence, maybe not.  I can succeed at all my rolls, yet never have an actual chance to satisfy my intent.<br/><br/>Ergo:  CR allows you to avoid frustrating your intent.  But TR allows you to be surprised, play sandbox with a predetermined environment, etc.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
My pejorative mental shorthand isn't a formal definition. "Quality" would not figure into a formal definition. Objectively speaking, TR and CR are just tools in the box, and whether they're good or bad depends on what you're trying to build.                        </div>

                            Actually, I think Tony's post is slightly confusing.  CR/TR has nothing to do with players disagreeing.<br>
<br>
Conflict Resolution is used when two or more characters within the created fiction want something and those somethings conflict.<br/>
Task Resolution simple resolves any probalistic action within the world WITHOUT resolving whether or not the character gets what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
The Classic Example:<br/>
<br/>
Jack the thief wants to get the diamond his rival Baron Ducardi wishes to use to propose to their mutual love interest Princess Irene.<br/>
<br/>
Using Task Resolution we roll to see if Jack sneaks past the guards, to see if Jack can locate the treasure room, to see if jack can pick the lock on the door, to see if Jack can spot and disarm the trap in the room, etc.<br/>
<br/>
See how none of these things individually decides if Jack gets the diamond or not?  This works just fine if the GM has a map and every lock, door, trap and guard between Jack and the diamond planned out.  First this is a lot of work for the GM but also in certain styles of play where the GM is being more foot loose it can be used to thinly disguise GM fiat.  See, the GM can simply keep inventing more and more tasks for Jack to do until Jack fails one if for whatever reason the GM doesn't want Jack to get the diamond.<br/>
<br/>
Conflict Resolution on the other hand resolves the important issue in one go.  See the conflict here is between Jack who wants the diamond and the Baron who doesn't want Jack to have the diamond.  So we roll Jack's Theiving Skill vs. the Baron's Leadership skill (or whatever best respresents the Baron's command over his estate) and if Jack wins then he's gotten through and gets the diamond.  If the Baron's Leadership roll wins they we say that Jack was caught by a guard or that a trap dumped him down into the dungeon, or whatever best makes sense from the context.<br/>
<br/>
A Note On Scale:<br/>
<br/>
Some people think this means that Conflicts are large on Tasks are small, but that's not the case.  Let's reward this example slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Jack wants to woo the Princess Irene who doesn't think very much of him.  Jack knows the Baron has a diamond (and assume in this case that the Baron is just a bit of setting color and not every interesting on his own).<br/>
<br/>
So, first we roll to see if Jack can steal the diamond from the Baron as above.  But given THIS context that's Task Resolution.  Because whether or not Jack steals the diamond doesn't resolve whether Jack successfully woos the Princess or not which is the conflict at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly Conflicts can be very small.<br/>
<br/>
Jack now kicks in the Baron's bedroom door because the Baron's henchmen have kidnapped the Princess Irene.  The Baron goes for his sword and Jack goes to kick over the table the sword is on.  That's a conflict.  What happens exactly to the sword?  We roll, it's settled.  Now the Baron decides to make a break for the door and Jack wants to leap in his way.  Again, that's a conflict, we roll and that issue is settled.  Next the Baron lunges bare fisted at Jack and Jack wants to wrestle him to the ground?  We roll.  Who gets hit?  Who gets tackled?  While the Baron is on the ground Jack tries to get the Baron to tell him where the Princess is.  Again we roll and so on.<br/>
<br/>
The point being that at each stage we are resolving conflicts between what the characters want and the actions they are taking to get them.  A key concept is that it's generally a bad idea simply to keep repeating conflicts.  Once the issue of the sword it's settled it's settled, the sword is either taken or it isn't.  No do-overs.  Simillarly once the issue of whether the Baron can escape the room is settled, it's settled.  No constant repeating of attempts to escape.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?<br/>

                            Alrigh. It's not scale. It's not the number of rolls.<br/><br/><br/>Tony says, the question is, what a player can get narrative authority about. That means in order to use TR you first need a GM. Would you say that all resolution is conflict resolution or are there still other types?<br/><br/><br/>What Jesse said does not imply such a hierarchy.
<blockquote>Conflict Resolution is used when two or more characters within the created fiction want something and those somethings conflict.<br/>Task Resolution simple resolves any probalistic action within the world WITHOUT resolving whether or not the character gets what he wants.</blockquote>
So both types require characters to be involved. Is that correct? <br/><br/>Event conflicts in Capes are then neither CR nor TR, for there need no characters to be involved. (At least not in the fiction. Someone must roll for the conflict to resolve.) Similar in Polaris were I can toss around key words without talking about characters at all.<br/><br/><br/>You cannot repeat a conflict. On the other hand many games with TR include a section calles "Try again", right? So a factor might be repeatablity. (Is that a word?) The question remains, what a repetition of a conflict is, but I think, we can leave that unsettled for now.                        </div>

<br/>
Oh absolutely, I'm very familiar with Dogs (the weekly groups is on their eighth town!).  I think that's why I said one go and not one roll.  I think of conflict resolution in Dogs as "one go" even though that "go" is broken up into several mechanical/fictional maneuvers.<br/>
<br/>
In short, the PROCESS of either Task or Conflict Resolution is wide open, so long as the concept of what is being resolved (any probalistic action vs incompatiable intentions among fictional characters) with that process is clear.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 1of3</cite>So what is the tertium comparationis?</blockquote>
One trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertium_comparationis" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a> later:<br/><br/>Yes, some mechanics are the common ground.  For instance: d20 skill rolls are a task resolution mechanic, but Prime Time Adventures card draws are a conflict resolution mechanic.  We will sometimes discuss whole systems as TR or CR, but that's ultimately a flawed shorthand, since while designers who are conscious of the distinction tend not mix them, you will occasionally find examples of both in one game.  Conceivably, you could find them nested - I might loosely describe <cite>The Shadow of Yesterday's</cite> Bringing Down the Pain as TR nested inside CR.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Cerling</cite>My pejorative mental shorthand isn't a formal definition.</blockquote>
We should all get that tattooed on our foreheads.<br/><br/>Because I don't know that "characters need to be involved" is true.  And I don't know that repeatability is an issue either.<br/><br/>Certainly, CR is meant to resolve a conflict, which implies that having resolved it, we don't return to it again.  That may or may not be a necessary factor to CR - and I'm interested in opinion.  Where it exists it does introduce a narrative strategy that tends towards broadening conflicts.  Don't go for the sword, go for what you really want: fresh thief's corpse.  Don't break in and steal the diamond, just win the girl's heart.<br/><br/>On the other hand, TR exists in the wild with and without repeatability options.  With repeatability descends into "I will roll until I succeed" - which, if I understand correctly, was one of the motivations for CR in the first place.<br/><br/>Jesse's implication that TR involves exactly one active character is trivially misleading: many TR systems exist that integrate opposed rolls.  And CR mechanics often handle single-character issues.<br/><br/>Similarly, I think the <cite>Capes</cite> example highlights the fact that neither kind of mechanic needs a character involved at all.  We might use TR to see if a bridge collapses due to age and weather, for instance.<br/><br/>Is it legitimate to suggest that the distinction is that TR serves a goal of garden variety simulation (of physics, or some other complex non-game system), which CR serves a different goal - of arbitration, maybe.  <br/><br/>If anything, the difference comes in when the mechanics are usefully engaged.  TR can be applied whenever the outcome is in doubt - or whenever I want to imply doubt about an outcome.  CR can be applied when we <em>care</em> about an outcome.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Conflict resolution is simply a method of resolution that concerns itself with the "intents", "goals", "objectives" or "interests" of the characters. As Jesse said, the scale of the conflict isn't important to the principles of Conflict Resolution, and if somebody had a "too-big" goal of "Kill the Dragon, save the Princess &amp; become King of all Men" or an out-of-genre "I want to find an atomic bomb in the Dragon's pile of treasure" goal or they wanted something that is obviously out of genre or scale for the game, you can call bullshit (just as you would with Task Resolution). So from now on, I'm assuming that all the goals are reasonable and at the scale of the game system.<br/>
<br/>
So, a conflict requires two or more "characters"* who have goals that are incompatible or would interfere with each other. That's a "conflict of interest" and that's when you get out the dice (or cards, or whatever). If there is no "conflict of interest", you don't roll. (Which is the origins of "Say Yes or Roll Dice.") It means you only get the system out for when things matter.<br/>
<br/>
Up front, everybody should make clear what the various goals for each of characters are, which should make it pretty clear who is in conflict with who. It also has the effect of knowing what is riding on the outcome of the dice before they are thrown (If my goal is "get onto the ship before it sails" and your goal is "throw your character in jail" we all know the potential consequences of these rolls are), and I find that increases tension at the table.**<br/>
<br/>
Then the dice come out and that determines who gets their goal and who doesn't. Note that this step can be quick &amp; simple, real crunchy, or anything you like. It can be one dice roll, or many, but it always has a definite end point. It can also generate any other side effects that might fall out of the conflict as well, like Fallout in Dogs in the Vineyard. What really matters here though, is that this step mechanically determines which characters achieve their goals and which ones don't.<br/>
<br/>
These results then need to be adhered to by all the participants when describing the outcome and effect of the conflict, rather than any kind of GM fiat as Jesse pointed out. Also note that this particular conflict has now been <i>resolved</i>, so unless circumstances change significantly, there cannot be another conflict over the same thing between the same characters again. (This is pretty much where "Let it Ride" in The Burning Wheel comes from)<br/>
<br/>
Task resolution systems are much more concerned with the "How" than the "Why". There will still be conflicts in these games (otherwise the game will be tragically dull) and they will have to get resolved <i>somehow</i> (otherwise the game won't go anywhere), but the system doesn't really help the GM in that regard. Instead, the GM has to determine how the success or failure of the tasks the characters perform helps towards resolving the actual conflict by looking at the situation and coming up with something reasonable based on those tasks. Now he can ask the players for their intents and so on, but this is just fitting a social-level Conflict Resolution system around the book's Task Resolution core; and that  (to me) is a lot of work when you can just get games which support Conflict Resolution anyway.<br/>
<br/>
* "characters" don't actually have to be, y'know, <i>actual people</i>. A cliff could well be a "character" in this sense with the goal of "dash climbers onto the jagged rocks below". It's just easier to think of it as happening between people first, and then extend that to inanimate, but dramatic, dangers in the fiction as well.<br/>
<br/>
** And as a hint I've just recently realised, goals that are "stay", "keep" or "prevent" are really dull. Much better to always have 'active' goals like. "Capture all intruders" rather than "Keep intruders out" for trivial example. It means that whatever the outcome of the dice, <i>something</i> new &amp; interesting happens.                        </div>

                            It's in identifying the difference between a conflict and a task.  Maybe it's because I'm a concrete, practical fella.  For me, "climbing the mountain" can be a conflict - man vs. nature - or it can be defined as a task - do I have the skill, luck, equipment, endurance, and so on.  Does that make sense?  When I proposed conflict resolution to my group the last time, a player said, "So if my goal is to stab the other guy with my sword and his goal is don't get stabbed, that's conflict resolution? How is that different from what we're doing now?" and I was all duh duh duh wha huh wha                        </div>

                            If your goal is to stab the other guy with a sword, then once you've done it... he's stabbed.  Well and truly so (or maybe just barely) but he's stabbed.  There!

<br>
The cliff example is a classic sticking point.  Have you ever seen any of the discussions over at The Forge about Characters vs. Furniture?  In Conflict resolution the mechanics resolve incompatiable goals between Characters.  The problem is that given context a Cliff can be Character and a Castle Guard can be Furniture.  And unfortunately the distinction is really tough to articulate but really easy to spot given an actual play context.<br/>
<br/>
Look at my original examples about the theif trying to steal the diamond from the Baron.  The conflict is between the theif and the Baron.  The Baron's castle guards are just furniture.  Or think of the castle guards as the weapon the Baron is weilding against the theif.<br/>
<br/>
So in the case of the Cliff?  Is the Cliff this lengendary mountain that "seeks" to beat down all who dare to cross it, "lording" its unclimability over all who come to challege its natural authority?  Then the cliff is a Character with a goal of putting down those who try to climb it.  However, if it's just any old cliff that stands between the character who is trying to climb it and another character who is counting on the cliff to slow that character down, then the conflict is between the two characters with the cliff just being a complicating circumstance much like the castle guards in the previous example.<br/>
<br/>
This is subtle and complicated I know.  I hope I've at least made it a little clearer.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>When a conflict resolves (every game has conflict resolution, but not every ruleset has mechanics for it) someone has gotten what they want.</blockquote>
Fred, that's such an excellent point.  (I'd quibble that someone has gotten <em>something like</em> what they want - I wanted the thief dead, but the result is he's at half HP and fled.)  That resolves so many of my own niggling issues regarding task versus conflict, specifically the fact that task systems seem to wind up nested inside conflict resolution.<br/><br/>And more to the point, it firms up my rabid agreement with Adam that a "pejorative mental shorthand" is not only not a real definition, but I think what most of us have in mind as far as what "task resolution" means.  <br/><br/>The discussion of resolution mechanics begins with childhood games like Cops and Robbers, where resolution comes down to "I hit you!"/"Noyadiddent!"  "Task resolution" mechanics build from there by saying: we'll let the mechanic decide and agree to abide by the decision.  But what that does is elevate the argument: the question becomes not "did that bullet hit you" but "how many times may I fire upon you?" -  if I can fire enough rounds, I'll hit eventually.  But we're still just bickering like kids about whether you succeed or fail, we're just pretending the argument is about whether I can shoot again or not.<br/><br/>Functional play introduces into the system some limit on repeated jeopardy, and by so doing become a form of conflict resolution.  As soon as we say "if you survive 3 attacks, you get what you want" we're establishing <i>ad hoc</i> conflict resolution.  Codifying that into the rule set is gravy (not to say it wasn't <em>amazingly cool</em> gravy, but gravy all the same).<br/><br/>One thing we set aside by simply putting the whole conflict up and resolving it within the rule set are the story telling potentials that task rolls give us.  Mostly, these are non-conflicts that have dramatic effect.  I'm considering specifically the ability to call for false Listen checks (in other words, there's nothing to hear) in <cite>Call of Cthulhu</cite> or order to drive home to the players that their characters are trying not to be caught.<br/><br/>So, a few points of this musing: we think ill of task resolution since our experience is that it amounts to little more than bickering with dice added for color.  But we can build functional conflict resolution out of task resolution, and there are useful effects of doing so.  And that task and conflict resolution are not actually mutually exclusive alternatives, but have a more complicated relationship that is (not strictly) hierarchal.                        </div>

                            Uck, I'm losing it again and going duh duh wah wah huh huh.  All human actions are infinitely divisible, so my brain just isn't getting there.  Even in so-called "task resolution" systems like the combat system of D&amp;D or GURPS, you're not resolving each motion of sword or gun or bullet, you're resolving a segment of time that may include feints, parries, clashes, lunges, dodges, turns, thrusts ("*thudddddd*")and so on.  Hell, in Gather Information checks in D20, you're resolving a big segment of time with the goal of finding information about someone or something that is represented by talking to contacts and strangers, picking up rumors and consulting colleagues.  I can see how this is to some degree the same as resolving "I swing my sword" in that system and different from a conflict resolution system, but god help me if I can tell you why it's different.<br/>
<br/>
Are Conflict Resolution systems just skipping more steps than Task Resolution?  Say the player has the goal of having his dude steal the diamond from the Baron with a combination of sneakinessitude and swashbuckling swordplay. Would a system that had one roll for Heisting and another for Combat be conflict resolution or task resolution?<br/>

I think the crucial step you're missing is that for Conflict Resolution you need two or more Characters.  And Character is also defined here as "entity within the fiction that carries emotional/moral/ethical/human significance."  Here's a process that might help.  With every action that a character is taking keep asking why?  Stop when your answer includes a Character as defined above.  <br/>
<br/>
Going back to the example:<br/>
<br/>
I'm sneaking past the guards?  Why?  Note: The gaurds are not a Character as I have defined it above.  They're just an obstacle.<br/>
To get to the treasure room... Why?<br/>
To find the jewelry chest... Why?<br/>
To get the diamond inside.... Why?<br/>
To stop the Baron from wooing the princess Irene with it...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Now as Judson pointed out some systems embed task detail (not 100% convinced this is the same as Task Resolution) within their Conflict Resolution Processes. <br/></blockquote>
The other confusing point, it seems to me, is that a lot of rule sets only treat task resolution, and it's up to a play group to extend that into a system that includes conflict resolution.  A curse and a blessing of that result is that some task resolutions will not be associated with a conflict.  <br/><br/>Perception checks of all stripes are the primary example here.  Consider on the one hand, sneaking through the serial killer's lair, and being made to roll a Listen check.  Failed?  Oh, hrm.  Okay.  Succeeded?  You don't hear anything.  No conflict here, but it certainly drives tension up.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you're searching a crime scene.  Roll Notice Things.  Failed?  Hm.  Well, I don't know where we go now, because that was The Clue.                        </div>

I don't know if I'm helping or otherwise, here, Jason.  Primarily because I'm developing my own sense of a difference, and I don't know how conducive that is to actually delineating a difference.  And I don't think I'm explaining from the same model that others (Jesse especially) are.  You may be able to synthesize the two views, or you might pick one over the other.  I will not be hurt if you tell me "Judson, shut up, you're confusing me."<br/><br/>That said: working from this example:<br/><br/>Jack the thief and the Baron both want to marry Brunhilde.  The Baron has acquired a gigantic diamond with which to woo her.<br/><br/>A system based on a rule set that treats only task resolution might proceed along these lines.  Jack's player directs him to break into the Baron's castle.  The GM presents obstacles, like the climb up the parapet, quietly entering a window, sneaking to the strongroom, unlocking the door, hiding the diamond, and finally a running battle with a bunch of mook guards to escape.  Bunch of task checks, and a whole combat that encompasses other task checks.  Jack escapes with the diamond.  <br/><br/>A different task-oriented ruleset might allow for one roll to attempt to break and enter, and take the partial result to indicate that the diamond was recovered but Jack was discovered, and a second roll defeats the guards and escapes.<br/><br/>Specifically important: the rules treat Jack's competence at tasks, and that's what we talk about.  We don't necessarily talk about what Jack wants out of the whole situation.  Many groups playing with these rules will never explicitly say "Jack wants to win the hand of Brunhilde."  At least, not in reference to the rules.  And there's nothing to say that there are more challenges in Jack's way than he can defeat.  (Well, there are huge and lengthy debates over Schrödinger's NPCs and whatnot, but that's not at all cogent to this discussion.)   The GM might even set out the fact that Brunhilde is more partial to rubies after Jack has stolen the diamond.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a conflict oriented rule set will want to know what Jack hopes to accomplish.  A particularly loose rule set might even allow for a goal like "Win Brunhilde's hand," depending on if how important this whole episode is.  We could break things down to almost any level.  "Jack steals the diamond, in order to woo Brunhilde" strikes me as fairly natural to the example.  In this case, when we resolve, we're resolving the whole conflict between Jack and the Baron, and fitting the course of events to that resolution.  <br/><br/>So what's import to this being conflict resolution is this: that we establish what Jack wants, we establish what's in his way <em>up front.</em>  And we point the rules at deciding the conflict - we agree that win or lose, we'll abide by the decision as it relates to the conflict.                        </div>

                            Actually, the three of those posts together helped bigtime.<br/>
<br/>
Let me throw out there what my hangup was (and still partly is).  I love mysteries. I read mystery novels of a hundred different kinds, I can go into great detail on them, "figuring things out" is a huge part of the games I run and play in.  In a mystery, you may be (in a sense) pitting yor investigative skills against that of the villain, but the great fun of mysteries is the uncertainty.  That uncertainty may take many forms. We all know Sherlock Holmes will solve the baffling case but we are uncertain as to what bizarre form the weird crime will take and we don't know who the criminal is. We might know who the killer is but we don't know how Columbo will get him to confess.  We know the cops have got the right guy but will the Law &amp; Order hot female prosecutor of the year get around the judge's crazy ruling.  We have no idea in the world why Shell Scott is getting shot at and we want to watch him wisecrack and punch his way to finding out.<br/>
<br/>
Only some of these uncertainties seem to lend themselves to "up front" conflict resolution between characters (or between players if that is who it is between.)  If the particular uncertainty we are looking to uncover like a stage magician doing a reveal (ta da!) has to be brought forward in order to resolve it at the conflict resolution level, you just sucked all the fun out of the mystery. "Thanks a lot for telling me she's her daughter AND her sister, I guess I'll skip the denouement and wrap things up in time for Lost..."<br/>
<br/>
Task resolution is one (the?) way of pacing the reveals, of pushing back the uncertainty until, ta da, the mystery is resolved and the episode/chapter/story is over.  There can be surprises for both GM and player if you use task resolution.  For conflict resolution, the only thing left after it's resolved is narrating how things happen.<br/>

                            Task Resolution resolves the success of <em>actions</em>. Conflict Resolution resolves the success of <em>goals</em>. "Pure" TR says nothing about goals; it's up to the group to link resolved actions to goals. Pure CR says nothing about actions; it's up to the group to link resolved goals to actions.<br/><br/>For really simple, concrete goals, such as goals where only one action is required and it's obvious what it is, Task and Conflict Resolution look the same. e.g. if your goal is "Hit this guy with my sword," there's no significant difference whether you use TR or CR.<br/><br/>For some goals, even though they're pretty specific, it's not immediately obvious that an action will accomplish the goal. Let's say instead of "Hit this guy with my sword," your goal was "Give this guy a scar with my sword." It's quite possible to take the action (hit the guy with your sword) but not accomplish the goal (give him a scar). Now, maybe the game system has written rules linking the action to the goal, e.g. "If you roll a natural 20 on your attack, the guy gets scarred." If the written rules don't say anything, the people at the table will come up with some way to decide whether the action accomplishes the goal. e.g. your GM might say "Yeah, if  you hit him, he gets scarred," or make up the natural-20-equals-scar rule, or say "No way can you scar him" (if your GM is lame). At this level, there's still not much of a difference between TR and CR, maybe just a bit of on-the-fly decision-making. <br/><br/>When goals are fairly abstract, or require a lot of actions, the difference between TR and CR becomes much more obvious. e.g. if your goal is "Make this guy fall in love me." Using TR, unless you already have rules that specify how to do this in your game, your group will have to make up some way of linking different actions to the overall goal. On the other hand, using CR, you'll find out if you succeed in wooing the guy, but your group will have to make up an explanation of how or why you succeeded.                        </div>

I'd say that task resolution and revelation of a mystery are tenuously related, at best.  Yes: you can have one or more kinds of "Discover Clues" checks, and use them to parcel out information.  You roll to search a desk - and if there's a clue there, and you succeed, you get the clue.  <br/><br/>Just as plausible, we avoid the whole question of resolution in terms of the mystery.  When you search the desk, you get any clues that are there.  Unknown Armies scenarios do this pretty regularly.  "Don't bother with a Notice check here, because if they don't spot this clue, show's over."<br/><br/>On the other hand, Columbo is itching for conflict resolution.  We know the killer.  Columbo enters into a harmless conversation, uses the Key Phrase "Here's what I'm confused about..." and Columbo and the killer roll.  High roll gets what he wants: Columbo wants a confession, the killer wants to explain away the current evidence.  The fun (to my eyes) is how to deal with "Here's what I'm confused about: I have video footage of you firing 12 times into Mr. Bodee's chest, and then beating him with an axe.  But you say you didn't kill him."  Look, Columbo loses.  Now the killer's player has to explain that away (ooh, fun!), and Columbo ends the scene: "Hmm.  Hmmm.  I see.  Of course.  Sorry to trouble you."<br/><br/>(Actually, maybe Columbo would make a good kata.  Each piece of evidence Columbo suggests, he gets a d6.  The killer starts with 3d6.  High roll wins.  Should take all of 15 minutes.)<br/><br/>Can you see how task resolution and conflict resolution would both treat the same situation in very different ways?                        </div>

I've seen this stated before, but it's completely broken down in discussion.  The reason is simple.  For any action, it's impossible to distinguish "success" from "failure" unless you know the intentions.  In practice, using traditional games ranging from RuneQuest to Ars Magica to Vampire to Fudge, it is extremely common for the GM to ask "What are you trying to do?"  <br/><br/>Here's a simple example from a GURPS game a few nights ago:  The player declares that he's holding  a knife to the fingers of a tied-up hostage.  He cuts off one of her fingers.  The GM asks what he's trying to do, and he specifies it.  The GM says "Roll Intimidation, and I'll give you a +2 circumstance bonus".  <br/><br/>Now, I suppose that technically the player could have rolled a critical success and the GM could have said back "OK, you cut off the finger but the guy still doesn't do what you say." -- but we the players would clearly say that wasn't right.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Selene Tan</cite>  When goals are fairly abstract, or require a lot of actions, the difference between TR and CR becomes much more obvious. e.g. if your goal is "Make this guy fall in love me."

Well, but many rolls in traditional games work this way.  For example, many games have abstract combat: i.e. the system tells you whether you do damage, but not how you succeed in doing it.  Similarly, I can roll to Gather Information in the D20 system.  If I succeed, I know that I got a piece of information, but the system doesn't say how.  <br/><br/>There is a sliding scale -- often varying based on group -- about how much description is made before the roll.  This applies to almost any game with Free Play, from D&amp;D to Dogs in the Vineyard to Fudge to My Life With Master.  For example, in a MLWM overture scene, its common have some free play before making the roll rather than just immediately making the roll and then playing out the scene.                        </div>

                            So, I don't think of TR and CR as mutually exclusive. Sometimes there are systems which tell you how to resolve the goals and the actions, all in one go. (e.g.: D&amp;D combat when your goal is "kill the enemies", DitV) I think these are awesome. Therefore I propose calling this kind of resolution AWESOME RESOLUTION, or AR for short.<br/><br/>AR!

                            Hmm, I'm beginng to think that the only significant difference between CR and TR is that you can't re-try a conflict using CR.<br/>
<br/>
Say I'm interrogating a prisoner. If I'm using TR, I can try different approaches and roll for each - or maybe try the same approach more than once, given sufficient time.<br/>
<br/>
If I'm using CR, then if I fail the conflict, that's it. I'm not going to get that information out of the prisoner.<br/>
<br/>
Conflicts often have less granularity than tasks, but both CR and TR involve a certain degree of interpretation when narrating what actually happened in the game space. And what if my goal is "to succeed at this action?" I think action vs goal may be an unnecessary addition.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone edumacate me as to what I'm missing?                        </div>

                            Imagine playing in a D&amp;D game.  You want to find discriminating evidence on another character.  But that goal doesn't matter to the GM.  What matters to the GM is what tasks you take and what their outcome is.

You have a recourse here to focus on what your actual goals are, and the tasks involved are either negotiable, or the GM proposes something, or whatever.<br><br>In my last AD&amp;D 2e game, the GM totally <i>did not care</i> what our characters' goals were.  He cared what they were <i>doing</i>.  He created a situation and was waiting for action to simulate what would happen next.  CR would have messed with this setup.  So if I said, "I want my character to achieve x," he would just say, "So what does your character do?"  There was never any guarantee that what my character did would have any potential impact on achieving the character's goal.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            On the People/Furniture divide: the easiest way for me to make the distinction is to ask, "If this was a movie, which characters' actors would be in the credits?"  If the character is played by Will Smith, it's a person.  If the character is played by Joe Nobody, he's furniture.  (<em>Tangent:</em> in the movie <em>GalaxyQuest</em>, the "extra" who gets strung along and nobody can remember his name?  Yeah, he was furniture in the television show, and was upgraded to person in the movie.)<br><br>On the difference between CR and TR: Conflict Resolution is about the <em>why</em>.  Task Resolution is about the <em>what</em>.  Sorry, Selene, but at no point are they the same.  "I hit him with my sword" is always Task Resolution; there's no <em>why</em> in there.  "I hit him with my sword to scar him / to intimidate him / to make it look like we're fighting / to kill him" is Conflict Resolution.  TR is about what happens; CR is about why it happens.  As has been mentioned, every game everywhere has Conflict Resolution, it just might not be explicit.  At some point, the group decides that a given character gets what he wants.  If there's an explicit CR, the character gets what he wants cause the cards/dice/points says so.  If there's no explicit CR, the character still gets what he wants or not eventually.  Maybe it's because he completed enough tasks (via TR) that he "should" get his goal, maybe the GM decides to give it to him, maybe they're trying to wrap things up in time for Lost.                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
Can I explore an example with you all? Let's say I'm in a D20 fight and I want to use a "called shot" to shoot a pouch off the belt of my opponent. Now, I can try for this every combat round, so I'm, not doing CR each time I roll for a shot. However, the fight isn't going to go on for ever, so does that mean that there is an <i>implict</i> conflict "do I get to shoot the pouch before the fight ends?"                        </div>

                            Hi!<br>
  I think the distinction between TR and CR is pretty simple:<br>
TR: How you get things done. Its focus is on what causes the characters are generating with their actions and tasks within the shared imaginary space.<br>
CR: What gets done. The emphasis is on what happens and what characters are trying to accomplish throught a series of actions and inaction. Generally, I see CR used in two cases:<br>
1) Cases where the designer wants a universal mechanic. One roll to rule them all. ditv is a good example of this. You never have to look up the stealth rules or the combat rules or the social combat rules. There's just one rule.<br/>
2) Cases where the designer wants there to be known stakes or definite outcomes. For instance, you won't get a result of "Nothing happens" in CR, unless the players have agreed to it.<br/>
  By and large they are the same quality, if you are asking about goodness. But different qualities meaning properties. I hope this helps<br/>

<p>Task resolution is between you and an imaginary object. Conflict resolution is between your interests and someone else's interests. It might help if we note that all games have both task resolution and conflict resolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>D&amp;D 3e task resolution: roll d20 + modifiers to beat a target number</li>
<li>D&amp;D 3e confilict resolution (combat): reduce opponent to 0 hp</li>
<li><p>D&amp;D 3e confilict resolution (non-combat): accomplish a chain of tasks determined by GM</p></li>
<li><p>GURPS task resolution: roll 3d6 below skill + modifiers</p></li>

<li>Sorcerer conflict resolution: roll dice pool to beat opponent's highest die roll</li>

<p>A large number of indie games use Drama for task resolution. Most mainstream games use the chain of tasks (essentially Karma resolution) for conflict resolution.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>Imagine playing in a D&amp;D game.  You want to find discriminating evidence on another character.  But that goal doesn't matter to the GM.  What matters to the GM is what tasks you take and what their outcome is.  So you might crack a safe, hoping to find evidence; but even if you succeed, the GM might tell you there's no evidence there.  You may have no actual recourse to figure out what tasks are actually needed to achieve your goal.  All that you have are tasks.</blockquote>
Well, this isn't really true.  D&amp;D has a mechanic for this: the "Gather Information" skill.  The GM sets a difficulty for how hard the information is to obtain, and then you roll your skill against that difficulty.  If you succeed, you find the information you're looking for: the map to the castle, the secret of the captain's sword, incriminating evidence, etc.  <br/><br/>This is what I would call differing level of abstraction.  Now, "Gather Information" is more abstract than most traditional RPG mechanics, but it's not unknown.  The Buffy RPG does similar with it's research rolls.  i.e. You want to find out about a particular monster.  You don't say where you're going or what you're checking, you just roll and if you succeed then you find somewhere about the information.  The mechanic doesn't specify it.  <br/><br/>For example, one case of abstraction is in combat mechanics.  For example, in Tunnels &amp; Trolls, combat is highly abstract.  You don't know what a given person is doing to attack -- they just roll their dice and you can add totals.  D&amp;D has a much lesser abstraction.  You specify the weapons used, though little else.  GURPS is even less abstract, specifying maneuver (like thrust vs swing and so forth).  <br/><br/>However, note that ultimately the group is going to restrict the level of abstraction for the game -- but it could vary highly.  For example, a character might have the motivation that he wants to be a famous hero whose deeds are sung of throughout the land.  If you're playing a large-scale, generational game -- the player might say "Look, let's roll to see if he gets to be a famous hero.  I don't want to have to specify the tasks out to accomplish that goal."  That works fine.  However, not everyone will want that level of abstraction.  Sometimes they might want to play out the individual quests along the way to that ultimate goal.  <br/><br/>Sometimes they might want to play out the individual quests that lead there.  However, this means that the PC could go on a quest, and it doesn't make him a famous hero.  Unless you put up the ultimate, highest level goal as the center of a mechanical procedure, then you can't be guaranteed of getting it.                        </div>

Is that right?  On that example a roll to hit in Gurps is task resolution, a roll to hit the weapon hand to make him drop his weapon is conflict resolution.  Your second example seems as much task resolution to me as the first, as it doesn't go to why I want to do those things.                        </div>

                            As I was saying <a href="http://www.therpgsite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1503" rel="nofollow">over on the RPGSite</a>, this is how I see the procedural difference bewteen TR &amp; CR:<br/><br/>In a 'pure' TR system, this is what I see happening:
<ol>
<li>A player wants X to happen ("I want to get the King to give my church money", "I want to kill that Orc"). He can keep it secret if he wants.</li>
<li>The player 'translates' his desire into an appropriate (series) of tasks for his character - let's call that task Y ("I'll persuade him", "I hit him"). He has to tell the GM this.</li>
<li>In order to perform Y, something in the mechanics determines the chances of success of the character to do Y.</li>
<li>The mechanic is applied and determines if the character does Y or not.</li>
<li>The GM* describes what happened, taking into account the results of Y and the current situation. Or, if Y is failed, the GM* comes up with the consequences of failure (which could be "nothing happens", or it could be "take 10d6 falling damage", or whatever) and applies them. (You can see this as translating the effects of action Y back into "did X happen", if you like)<br/>* Subnote: This can just be GM skills, or it can be GM + specific rules, like Bluff checks in D&amp;D 3.5 or whatever.</li>
<li>Depending on how good the translation from X-&gt;Y-&gt;X went, the player may or may not have got his original X, even if he succeeded. In the case of failure, the consequences are not always known to the player when he started his action by telling the GM 'Y'.</li>
</ol>
In CR, there is less translation:
<ol>
<li>A player wants X to happen ("I want to get the King to give my church money", "I want to kill the Orc"). He <i>has</i> to tell the GM this.</li>
<li>Another character must want to prevent or interfere with X by wanting Z ("I want to stay as rich as possible", "I want to kill him right back"). If not, we are done, the player gets X and somebody describes what happened.</li>
<li>In order to obtain X against Z, something in the mechanics determines the chances of success of the character to obtain X against Z.</li>
<li>The mechanic is applied and determines if the player gets X or not, as well as if the other guy gets his Z or not.</li>
<li>The GM (or sometimes players, depending on system) describes what happened, taking into account the results of X &amp; Z (and any other restrictions that steps 3 &amp; 4 might apply).</li>
</ol>
Does that make any sense?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doug Ruff</cite><br/>Say I'm interrogating a prisoner. If I'm using TR, I can try different approaches and roll for each - or maybe try the same approach more than once, given sufficient time.<br/><br/>If I'm using CR, then if I fail the conflict, that's it. I'm not going to get that information out of the prisoner.</blockquote>
Possibly related point that might help illuminate CR tactics.<br/><br/>If I'm GMing a Conflict Resolution based system, I'm never going to leave a Conflict goal defined as 'Do I succeed at X?', where the result of a failure is simply "no."  That's boring and ends up being kinda lame and frustrating for everyone.<br/><br/>"Do you get the information out of the prisoner before the authorities show up and take you to task for using illegal questioning methods?" or  "Do you get information that the enemy doesn't already know is compromised?"  Something like that.<br/><br/>You'll note, actually, that in that first example, you can actually TRY AGAIN LATER -- you didn't fail to get the information, you failed to do it before you were interrupted -- the door has not been shut -- your CR failure just put this hairy, pissed-off owlbear in your way that you have to deal with first.<br/><br/>In my experience, TR-thinking tends to mess up CR 'goal setting' a bit, because TR can AFFORD to be a binary, "yes/no, win/lose" result -- you can just try again on your next go-round.<br/><br/>And, as you said, most TR systems do 'switch' to CR for at least a few of the skill checks, if nothing else... I think, in those instances, the GM and players would benefit from knowing about the 'tricks' of setting good conflict-level goals so that failure doesn't mean 'no', it means 'things just got more interesting.'<br/><br/>Anyway, my two ducats.                        </div>

Good point.<br/><br/>Actually, this was a real issue once in one of my games.  I was running Dying Earth, which uses conflict resolution.  A player had a fight with a guard, lost the contest and said "ok, I back off and then go for him again".  We explained that the point of the contest was to resolve the issue of whether he could humiliate this guard as he had wanted to, and that he had failed.  That it was done.<br/><br/>He kept saying "howcome I can't just hit him again?"  Everyone else was on board, for good or ill, that the outcome of the conflict was the outcome of the conflict but for him I think he felt to use jargon deprotagonised by being defeated without being plainly incapable of continuing in game.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doug Ruff</cite>Let's say I'm in a D20 fight and I want to use a "called shot" to shoot a pouch off the belt of my opponent. Now, I can try for this every combat round, so I'm, not doing CR each time I roll for a shot. However, the fight isn't going to go on for ever, so does that mean that there is an<em>implict</em>conflict "do I get to shoot the pouch before the fight ends?"</blockquote>
Doug, sure there's an implicit conflict.  There's probably <em>lots</em> of conflicts flying around the table.  What you aren't doing, however, is engaging in conflict resolution.  You're still at task resolution.  It would be conflict resolution if you had stakes to the effect of "divest him of his pouch."  Which sounds similar to "called shot to shoot off pouch" -- but if you're just relying on called shots, there's nothing to say he doesn't just pick up the damn pouch.<br/><br/>Oh, you might say, if the GM did that, everybody at the table would throw popcorn at him.  And yes, you are absolutely right, and <em>that is the system</em> you're using for conflict resolution.  (System is the means by which the players decide on what happens in the fiction, remember.)  The called shot thing was dealing with tasks.  What it <em>means</em> -- the why -- is handled by conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Any better?  Balbinus, did that clarify your question?                        </div>

Yep agreed. And what Josuha Newman (I think) said on the Forge, this makes a hell of a lot of sense to me w.r.t. Conflict Resolution.
<blockquote>"- As a rule, you don't want your Intents (including your Story Goal) to be to "stay" or "keep" or "prevent" something.</blockquote>
Much better to always have 'active' goals like. "Capture all intruders" rather than "Keep intruders out" for trivial example. It means that whatever the outcome of the dice, <i>something</i> new &amp; interesting happens. That means the situation changes, which usually allows a reattempt or (more likely) another conflict to arise naturally anyway.<br/><br/>It's obvious, but I needed to see it written down to see how important (and simple) it is.<br/><br/>(edited to make it clear who I was agreeing with. Although I agree with JBR too!)                        </div>

Hm.  This seems different to me than what warren is talking about, though.  For example, take his example of persuading the King to give money to the church.  Suppose I'm playing a D20 game.  I make a Diplomacy check to persuade the King.  If I fail, then I definitively fail, because the D20 rules specify that Diplomacy skill does not allow retry.  If I succeed, then I have persuaded the king.  So he will try to give the money to the church.  However, he could be assassinated before he does, or his treasurer might embezzle the money, or some other thing happens.  <br/><br/>What warren is talking about seems to be scale -- specifying results beyond the current time and location.                        </div>

                            For what it's worth, definitive stakes are something of a red herring; it depends on the game.  In something like <em>PTA</em>, it probably a good idea for stakes to establish almost permanent facts; in <em>Dogs</em>, stakes only apply until another conflict overwrites them.                        </div>

That seems like a good distinction.  I've seen the term "counter-stakes" used to describe an opposing goal which is resolved in the same roll.  However, many people have used the term "Conflict Resolution" for mechanics even when there aren't active counter-stakes.  <br/><br/>It seems like people are trying to define "Conflict/Task" with some very different criteria.  I'd like to suggest that we need more than a binary distinction here.  The ability to retry is different than counter-stakes.  What is a red herring versus a blue tuna depends on your point of view.                        </div>

                            John,<br/><br/>I should have clarified that I was talking about AD&amp;D 2e.  There's a nonweapon proficiency called Information Gathering, I believe, but my DM would never let me use it to get something that's in an opponent's safe. We'd have to walk through every single step of getting there.  Information Gathering is for figuring out something that people on the street could know, not for getting evidence.<br/><br/>But that's debating the example, which doesn't get us very far.<br/><br/>The point was that there's a very different attitude here.  One is based on pre-created facts, character/player knowledge, and tasks that simulate action and reaction according to what the DM feels most likely to happen and what the dice turn out to determine.  In this approach, goals might be there, but they do not structure the <br/><br/>The other is based on starting with an explicit goal and then being able to resolve the goal.  The tasks to get there are then secondary, but I definitely get a chance to resolve the goal.<br/><br/>There's middle ground there, which has already been mentioned, in that the DM and player agree on the tasks to get to the goal. But in pure task resolution as I've experienced it, my DM would never tell me if my tasks had an actual chance at fulfilling the goal.  "Try and see" is the attitude there.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>However, many people have used the term "Conflict Resolution" for mechanics even when there aren't active counter-stakes.</blockquote>
True, but "counter-stakes" are just the mechanical part of things. There has to be an opposing/interfering goal in Conflict Resolution, because the whole point is to resolve a <i>conflict of interest</i>. If there wasn't this opposing/interfering goal, then there would be no point in bringing out the system. And I have just realised that having these goals be active in some way produces better (read "more involving") conflicts than passive ones.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard, for example doesn't have mechanical counter-stakes, but the fact that the townsfolk want things from the Dogs produces that incompatible goal that drives the conflict. NPCs that don't want anything from the Dogs are rare and just "Say Yes" shopkeepers and whatnot.<br/><br/>EDIT: And to go on more about 'active' goals for a second, I can say that towns where the NPCs wanted 'active' stuff were more gripping than those where the wants were more 'passive' ("Get the Dogs to say that my Drinking is permitted" as opposed to "Hide my drinking from the Dogs")                        </div>

Well, but people have also given DnD combat as an example of conflict resolution.  For example, Vincent Baker posted this on anyway: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/143.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Conflict Resolution in D&amp;D-style combat</b></a><br/><br/>There, he asserts: <blockquote>The roll to hit is Task Resolution, plus Conflict Resolution if you fail. The damage roll is Conflict Resolution if you succeed. Taken all together, it's Conflict Resolution.</blockquote>
The important thing for him was concrete stakes for the roll.  So if a mechanic has a definite effect -- i.e. take off X hit points, gain 1 point of Love, accomplish a predefined Stake -- then it's Conflict Resolution.                        </div>

                            What's fascinating to me here is that there's so many criteria for TR vs. CR being espoused.<br/><br/>There's:
<ol>
<li>Model of intent: TR is how (what you're attempting), CR is why (what you want to accomplish)</li>
<li>Repeatability: TR you can try again, CR not.</li>
<li>Type of opposition: TR is versus world, CR is versus characters.</li>
<li>Level of detail: TR is narrow focus, CR is a higher view.</li>
</ol>
Did I miss any?  Really, I think we can natter on and on because we're trying to explain this distinction from at least 4 different directions, and I think there's two important points to take away.<br/><br/>First of all, Fred wins: All games have Conflict Resolution.  It might not be in the rules, but to advance a plot, or even just <strong>have stuff happen,</strong> your game has to resolve conflict.  So trying to categorize games as CR vs. TR is a false dichotomy.  <br/><br/>Second, and this is up front contentious: only <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> there is a valid distinction.  Conflict resolution is about following up on intent, task resolution is about determining ability.  Many games indicate that you can't re-try task checks, and many games do allow re-tries of conflicts (consider how many times you've seen a sentence like "you can't try to get your intention again <em>unless the situation changes."</em>  The "cliff is a character" idea only exists to support <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> - if you aren't trying to support the oppositional criteria, you don't need it.  And level of detail is difficult enough to argue that it doesn't really need to be refuted.                        </div>

                            I think tieing CR or TR to specific rules is a red herring. The categories are not about rules, but about their implementation: what the rules are used for. <br/>
<br/>
Are they used to figure out if Bob gets what he wants or are they used to figure out if Bob successfully ties his own shoes?<br/>
<br/>
So it's not about the rules, it's not about the games. It's about what you are doing with them at the game table. And I think all this distinction is good for, is to draw more attention to how and why we use (certain) rules; giving players - especially GMs - a better grasp of the game.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Well... Ron isn't infallible.</blockquote>
Well, that was Vincent Baker rather than Ron Edwards.  And I didn't mean to imply that he was infallible.  <br/><br/>Actually, I think the problem isn't that anyone is fallible and explained Conflict Resolution "wrong".  Rather, the problem is that all of these (including Vincent's but also many other peoples') are potentially good definitions.  However, they're all trying to use the same term.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>I should have clarified that I was talking about AD&amp;D 2e.  There's a nonweapon proficiency called Information Gathering, I believe, but my DM would never let me use it to get something that's in an opponent's safe. We'd have to walk through every single step of getting there.  Information Gathering is for figuring out something that people on the street could know, not for getting evidence.</blockquote>
Well, having to "walk through every single step of getting there" is an occaisional annoyance that I have with games as well.  I've discussed it from time to time for a while.  But the annoyance for me is at its core the scale.  If something isn't interesting to play out action by action, then I want to resolve at a higher scale, aka a higher level of abstraction.  
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>There's middle ground there, which has already been mentioned, in that the DM and player agree on the tasks to get to the goal. But in pure task resolution as I've experienced it, my DM would never tell me if my tasks had an actual chance at fulfilling the goal.  "Try and see" is the attitude there.</blockquote>
And that's insisting at a low scale.  <br/><br/>Here's the thing.  There are always a variety of goals, each one at a higher scale than the other.  So, for example, if you want to get the King to give money to the church.  Is your purpose really to help out the Church?  That could be done without the King's money, or even without money at all.  The Church could get new people volunteering for it.  Getting the King to give money is just one way of getting your higher goal, and potentially it might not accomplish what you want.  For example, the King could give money to the Church, but then confiscate their lands.  So potentially, you could just say "I'd like to help out the Church" and figure out from the resolution how you accomplished that.  <br/><br/>My point is just that I think scale is a vital aspect which is often overlooked.                        </div>

Yeah, my answer to that is what Fred is saying. To expand: If you've got a bunch of concurrent goals, all at different scales, the level you resolve at is the (lowest?) level that really engages your players. (which is a working defintion of "nontrivial" in this context, I think.) This is the same as concurrent tasks, isn't it?<br/><br/>You could have an overall task of<br/>* "Do reach the hidden Isle of St.Norbert?"<br/>which you could resolve with one task (Seamanship or something), or break it down into:<br/>* "Do we hire a ship?" (Bargin)<br/>* "Do we find a map chart?" (Library Use)<br/>* "Do we navigate a good course?" (Navigation)<br/>* "Can we keep this ship on this course?" (Sailing)<br/>etc.<br/><br/>That last one could be decomposed down into:<br/>* "Do we tie off the mainsail correctly?" (Rope Use)<br/>* "Do we avoid the boom during this tack?" (Athletics)<br/>* "Can I hold onto this line in a heavy storm?" (Strength)<br/>* "Do I know what angle to trim the topsail at?" (Sailing)<br/>and so on, depending on the needs of the game and the players.<br/><br/>You work at the level of the system*, or, failing that, the level which interests and engages your players.<br/><br/>* Because sometimes you have got a system-imposed scale (PTA springs to mind here, a conflict is pretty much always "scene scale", whereas tMW states "a Conflict encompasses the actions a single character takes to achieve a simple, specific goal. Any goal that requires multiple, progressive steps should be broken into separate Conflicts for each step.") which you can't do much about.<br/><br/>EDIT: Or what Fred said! Damn me and my long posts!                        </div>

                            Ooh, I just had another thought! The level you resolve a conflict at is the (lowest) level the thing you would have a conflict with isn't furniture (as defined by Joshua BishopRoby):
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>On the People/Furniture divide: the easiest way for me to make the distinction is to ask, "If this was a movie, which characters' actors would be in the credits?"  If the character is played by Will Smith, it's a person.  If the character is played by Joe Nobody, he's furniture.</blockquote>
So looking at Fred's levels of conflict in this light:<br/><br/>"Does my blow hit the guard?" &amp; "Does it do enough damage to remove him from the fight?" - I'm guessing the guard is just furniture, so you wouldn't really have a conflict here. <br/><br/>"Do the guards keep us from getting to the altar before the priest sacrifices her?" Sounds like the priest is a proper NPC, so this is the level I would resolve at. If, on the other hand, the priest is just a joe nobody ("Oh, we have lots of evil priests around here") then the next level up -- "Do we save the princess?" -- would be the way to go.<br/><br/>Conversely, if you are in the epic final showdown with the high priest played by Will Smith, you might want to "zoom in" and resolve a "I want to kill this guy!" conflict.                        </div>

<cite>Well, having to "walk through every single step of getting there" is an occasional annoyance that I have with games as well.</cite><br/><br/>What I'm talking about is not having to take small steps, but <i>not knowing whether my steps are addressing my goal</i>.  Because the world is being run in physical simulation mode, and I am not being told anything my character doesn't know, I have no idea whether the steps I take actually have a chance at achieving what I want (or what my character wants).<br/><br/>And sure, scale is a factor. But tasks are often predefined in their scale.  An attack is a task.  Searching one room at a time is a task.  Picking one lock is a task. From the 3.5 SRD: <br/><br/>"Action: It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side."<br/>"Action: Opening a lock is a full-round action."<br/><br/>But when I search that area or pick that particular lock, I have no guarantee that that action has any relevance at all to finding the incriminating evidence I'm looking for.  I simply may be looking in the wrong place--or there may be none to find.  But because my character's knowledge is limited, the DM would never say, "You need to search over here to have a chance of fulfilling your goal."<br/><br/>In contrast, any raise in Dogs or action in an extended HeroQuest conflict counts toward my goal, even if the tasks of the specific actions are at exactly the same scale.  And when we're through with the specifically delineated conflict in either of those systems, I have my answer to whether I managed to fulfill my goal.                        </div>

Well, I like this in the sense that it's something important to me.  This is also what I would call "scale" or "level of abstraction".  This goes with an old old anecdote that it was technically possible to play out a trip to the bathroom round by round.  However, you didn't want to do that because, well, it was boring.  <br/><br/>I would say that you should the right resolution scale for the interests of the players.  <br/><br/>If you're playing a game of weighty matters to the country over decades, then maybe a trip to settle some problems in a border town can be handled by a single skill roll.  In another game, settling the problems in the border town might be the focus of an entire adventure.  Both of these are fine.                        </div>

I agree entirely.<br/><br/>I also think the people/furniture divide works here as well: The cast of major NPCs should reflect the interests of the players. If you are playing a game of kingship &amp; diplomacy then the major NPCs should be barons, barbarian queens, courtiers and so on, which should lead to conflicts on that scale of towns, counties and warfare. If you are playing a more "life on the frontier" kind of game, the major NPCs will be the sheriff, the bar owner, the bandit gang leader and so on. Conflicts with them will naturally be at a different scale.                        </div>
