It's been around in the ideasphere for a while.<br/><br/>In another thread, I was reminded of some cool essays on early collaborative roleplaying that could be applied to everything from Dungeons and Dragons to Apocalypse World. Basically removing the responsibility for some things from the GM and scattering them amongst the players, either lightly (Lite GM; like in the case of a GM who wants to orchestrate a story but doesn't like/follow the rules) or completely (GMLess).<br/><br/>Here's the entire "ERGO" collaborative process, INCLUDING the illustrative designs, thanks to the WaybackMachine! This is an essay that Ian Millington (AI programmer and PhD) put together in the late 90s/early 2000s. The article and illustrations really got my wheels spinning back then:<br/><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021106195024/http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org/information/startingToCollaborate" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20021106195024/http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org/information/startingToCollaborate</a><br/><br/>I later interviewed Ian about this collaborative roleplaying process:<br/><a href="http://ptgptb.org/0020/coop.html" rel="nofollow">http://ptgptb.org/0020/coop.html</a><br/><br/>Finally, a link to what appears to be The Game of ERGO, but I actually treat as a really long (and potentially dry at times) essay on collaborative roleplaying, and the tips and tricks that help make it awesome:<br/><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030827023732/http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org/games/ian/ergo/ergo_one.txt" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20030827023732/http://www.collaborativeroleplay.org/games/ian/ergo/ergo_one.txt</a><br/><br/>I had a fit of nostalgia reading through these again. I think they're still quite relevant today! Even though we tend to gravitate towards Already GMLess By The Rules games when we want GMless gaming, there's a lot here in terms of going full collaborative, or going LIGHT collaborative (which I think is also an excellent idea, still relevant).<br/><br/>Give them a read if you're interested!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378798/#Comment_378798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T14:01:50+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  2:01PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ergo was a huge influence on Geiger Counter and other early-ish GM-less designs of mine, along with Polaris and PTA. Ian Millington is one smart dude, even if his documents are more theory and concepts than explicit methods (or, at least, that was my impression of them way back when; it would be interesting to re-read them now!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378807/#Comment_378807" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-17T15:39:51+00:00" title="May 17, 2012  3:39PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent stuff, Andy!
