Hence my overwhelming joy to see the thread pop up here where John Harper posted a sort of pre-release version of the miniaturized, streamlined version of the rules. It boiled down everything to a simple, two-page explanation that still hit on the high points without any fluff or filler at all (although I do miss the various special abilities each different style and role got). And luckily, I got a chance this week to try it out with my regular game group, since have of the guys were absent for whatever reason.<br/><br/>In short, it went terribly. The two heroes were stymied at every turn, barely taking down a single threat without dooming themselves with a laughable number of danger results on their dice. No matter what they tried, no matter how they approached (cautious, aggressive, hitting all their enemies weaknesses and avoiding all of their enemies strengths), they were owned within the third round of every encounter. The Danger Meter didn't even have time to reach halfway full before the heroes took themselves down, and we all were incredulous. What went wrong?<br/><br/>We used the game to play in Eberron (one of my favorite settings and one I'm trying to get them interested in), with a simple re-skin of the style/action split (Powerful, Deft, Mental, or Magical paired with Battle, Stealth, Influence, or Exploit, a catch all action category). The initial situation set the cleric and paladin up to stop a lightning rail hijacking by some bomb-equipped kobolds, and this was the first time everything went to shit. After stopping the kobold leader from blowing up a brand new rail station as it went by with his elemental magic, the characters took themselves out in a fashion suited only to the Three Stooges. The situation got worse: now the kobolds were in control of the train and had it hurtling at top speed toward a gnomish town, intent on destroying it with their bomb. Again, the players were hapless and the town was destroyed in fire as the elemental pulling the train along was released. Nothing went right for the next three encounters either, and at the end of the two hour session, I sat back stunned.<br/><br/>I had played Danger Patrol before, and it was sound. I had checked and double-checked (but not triple-checked) this two-page document, and it seemed sound as well. But here we were, finally calling a close on the lives of Khorvaire's unluckiest of holy soldiers without even a mote of success to cheer their afterlives. This game had no promise. It was only fun in the same way that watching someone lose at Jenga is fun; no you are just disappointed that you have to clean up the mess. So we got to talking about why I thought it would be fun, and how the creators other games were brilliant... what happened here?<br/><br/>That is, of course, when it hit me. I was expounding on the similarities of Danger Patrol to Ghost/Echo, when a whisper of a thought stopped me mid-sentence just as I was explaining the importance of being "especially well-prepared" in the latter. "There is nothing like that in Danger Patro... Oh. Oh no." You see, there IS something like that in Danger Patrol Pocket. In Ghost/Echo, you want to be "especially well-prepared" because it gives you an extra die that <i>cannot</i> count against you, it simply improves your chance that everything will go well. And Danger Patrol has bonus dice (d8s) that are great... more dice mean more chance for taking out the threats. Of course, you can't forget that they don't ever never ever result in danger. Every other type of dice you roll in the game gives you a hit on 4+, and danger on 3-, except for bonus dice. Which <i>would</i> make them great, but we didn't play it that way. We just counted EVERYTHING as danger, including the d8s. And I felt ill about it... how different would the game have been? Did I just ruin this thing forever, even thought we had done it wrong? There must have been dozens of extra threat dice and complications that were generated because we miscounted the dice.<br/><br/>I was determined that we go through the last encounter and try it with the correct rules. And wouldn't you know, suddenly they heroes were taking down threats, working as a team to give bonuses and splitting up their truly effective efforts. As icing on the cake, there were 5 separate times in this encounter when counting the d8 misses as danger results would have taken out one of the heroes, but instead, using the correct rules, just made things slightly more problematic. The players crushed the corpulent kobold mutants in the gladiator pit, pushed back the encroaching shadowfell tendrils, and squeezed out under the portcullis, all without being overwhelmed in the second round of action. It was dramatic, full of action and danger, and really provoked the creativity of the three of us... thanks to one tiny, obvious rule. Remarkable.<br/><br/>We're going to try it again. And probably with more people. But the relief I felt was powerful. I knew that the game couldn't be as bad as it seemed at first look (and second look, and third...) but I had no idea what happened. I chalk my mistake up to concentrating extra hard on longer game books because there are so many rules to miss, but not focusing on a two-page game because "come on, two pages... I didn't forget anything."

I was able to throw together big beasts that could be easily tricked (via "mental exploit") but you wouldn't want to fight them straight on ("powerful battle"). Getting from the back of the hijacked lightning train to the engine to prevent a disaster was easier if you climbed on the outside where the kobolds weren't patrolling, but that in and of itself was incredibly dangerous (making "deft stealth" both a weakness <i>and</i> a strength). A swarm of rats was weak against large fiery spells ("magical battle"), while a warforged guard could be hacked (weakness "deft exploit") more easily than fought. It's a fun and flexible system for opponents, and it gives depth to what might otherwise seem a bit samey. Top marks for this!<br/><br/>The other thing that I really like, and this was present in the previous versions of Danger Patrol, was the way danger results fed back into the system and took any pressure off of the GM to roll or strategize. I just got to make up terrible consequences, ridiculous injury, and unfortunate complications. Everyone had a say in creating pre-roll danger (adding d6s to the roll) and post-roll danger (explaining the threat dice and complications). It was fun, even if we had FAR too many danger results because of my missed rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373165/#Comment_373165" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T23:21:27+00:00" title="April 16, 2012 11:21PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woo hoo!

Now I just need to find a chance to play this.</blockquote>\nAlas, if only you were in the PDX area. I always bring Danger Patrol to every game I go to, and now with it's convenient pocket size and a convenient dice-carrying pouch, it's much easier for me to bring it EVERYWHERE.<br/><br/>I could, for instance, be suddenly attacked at work by rabid gamers, and still be able to break out the Danger Patrol.<br/><br/>...I think the only time I won't have it with me is while I'm out with my GF. ...although, <i>she</i> always brings along her laptop so she can post on her RP forums...so maybe it'd be okay for me to bring along dice? Hmmm....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
