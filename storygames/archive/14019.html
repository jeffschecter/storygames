I am the farmboy who picks up a sword, fights things to get better at being a swordsman until I kill the man who killed my father - then I go to take on the kingdom's champion - then I take on the uber monster - then I take on the gods - then I take on.. etc etc. Each time I want to find the net bigger challenge, have adventures that make be good enough to beat it, then find the next challenge.<br/><br/>The Iconic Game - This game is essentially about I am a hammer, how do I make the problem into a nail. I am superman I win any problem that is just a physical challenge. There is a problem presented where I cant (for now) make it a purely physical problem (he has kryptonite, there are two issues happening at the same time and I have to choose who dies, etc) I have to make choices that will change my character - (I become heartless so I no longer care that I'm killing innocent bystanders so I can eliminate the person using human shields, or I become cunning enough to get the BBG away from the human shields) but those changes make a new problems for me (as a heartless bastard I am no longer beloved by the people, how to get their love back? or, because I wasn't heartless I let important people die so we need to replace those people, etc).<br/><br/>In Advancement, you want to have ever increasing points/dots on your sheet, you want ever escalating challenges - you want to improve your best skills and always use them. In Iconic you always have around the same points on your sheet, but you move them around, you want to be challenged in where you are weak.<br/><br/>Which type of game do you like? Is there another kind of game as well? What type of stories are these games good for?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317543/#Comment_317543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T03:35:11+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  3:35AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm...I have no experience with the second type of play you describe because in most of these challenge-oriented games you have a party. And then each member of a party fills a niche, like: one guy is a hammer, another is a screwdriver, a third is glue. Which only incentivizes that they only get better at being a hammer, so they can hammer while the other guy screws...I have a hard time thinking about this as anything other than solo play, because why would I change my character if we already have someone else in the party who is already good at what we need?<br/><br/>Can you give any examples of Iconic play games? <br/><br/>Unless iconic play is not about challenges but rather about how my character changes, then totally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317546/#Comment_317546" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T04:12:46+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  4:12AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Iconic play games. you are playing something like "House MD" or "CSI", or "Sherlock Holmes" etc. The show is apparently about a doctor or police or investigation, but actually, the show is about their other issues which always change.<br/><br/>eg Sherlock Holmes is a master of putting together the pieces. If you present him with a bunch of facts he KNOWS what happened and why. End of story. These are shown in the begining when Watson reads a few cases and Sherlock solves them offhandedly in a few seconds. The interesting story comes when he doesn't have all the facts - so I have the skill of "Solve Crime: YES". <br/>But, when not all the facts are present, I have to use other skills like disguise, or asking tough questions, and I have to risk getting in trouble with the law, or pissing off friends and making enemies by asking the wrong questions so that I can get all the facts. When I have all the facts I apply my "Solve Crime: YES" to finish that story.<br/>But again - now my "Police contacts" has dropped from excellent to mediocre becase I asked the wrong questions, or now I have foiled some plot and The Dockside workers are now trying to kill me - and onto the next problem which i cant solve the exact same way because my resources at hand have changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317547/#Comment_317547" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T04:25:36+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  4:25AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2011 4:29AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>Which type of game do you like?</blockquote>\nAll together, now:  "IT DEPENDS."<br/><br/>Tell me what the premise of the game is, how long we'll be playing it, and what the characters are capable of accomplishing right off the bat, and I can come up with a halfway reasonable notion of whether I'll be happier with or without character advancement.<br/><br/>Generally, though, my gut reaction is this:  if we're going to be playing the game for a long time, and if I am not able to make the character I want to play at the general level of ability that I want to play at right out of the box, then I want Advancement:  and <i>fast</i> Advancement at that, not an achingly slow progression that will only get me to where I want to be after a hundred sessions of play.  Ideally, I want to play that game for 16-20 sessions and have the character I want by at least the 10th session, if not sooner.  If the system offers something cool and interesting at a higher power level (new powers or expanded tactical options or whatever), I think it's good to be able to take advantage of it, and I get annoyed if we never do.  If I'm learning the system for the first time, it's nice to start small and work my way up, acquiring new abilities, greater power, more options, etc., as we go.  I like having something new to look forward to, and knowing that the way I'm playing this week is not necessarily going to be the way I'm playing four weeks from now.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, I can get the character I want to play right away or if the premise of the game is such that there's no such thing as a higher power level, or if the system has no real learning curve, or if we're not going to be playing the game for very long, then Advancement is pretty irrelevant.  I won't really miss it if it's not there.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>Is there another kind of game as well?</blockquote>\nAre there other types of game?  Sure, at least conceptually:  there's "Degeneration," for one, where the character gets worse at things as the story progresses.  In that type of game, resources get used up and never replaced, whether they're some kind of game currency or dice pools or whatever.  Victory and defeat both come at a price, and resource management skills are what separates the losers from the winners; the winners know how to ration out their efforts only where they will do the most good, so as not to fritter them away pointlessly.  (I'm pretty sure there are games of this type out there, but I can't name any of them.  Probably someone else here can, though.)<br/><br/>I can also imagine a "Transcendent" sort of approach, where the game itself changes as it goes along, making the old character sheet irrelevant: your character no longer interacts with anything he used to, and instead switches over to a different playing field with different rules and different kinds of interaction.  Sort of a metagame-y thing, where the player is driving some concept larger than just a character.  Maybe the whole set of game mechanics is different at each stage of that kind of game?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>What type of stories are these games good for?</blockquote>\nThe obvious answer would be that your "Iconic" is particularly well-suited to one-shot games or playing very focused, short-term scenarios, because on that brief a timeline "Advancement" simply doesn't make much sense.  It might also work pretty well for emulating particular types of media (comic books, TV shows).<br/><br/>Advancement's great for games where you need to work your way up to doing grander things for whatever reason (you're learning the game, you're going to be playing for a while and want to be able to shake things up, your desired concept demands more capabilities than a starting character can possess, etc.).<br/><br/>What I don't think is good is when a game promises one thing but only delivers the other.  I remember a lot of games whiffing on this level (7th Sea and WoD games in particular), where they'd provide all these awesome high-powered abilities and great high-powered concepts (running a city, mastering a type of magic, being Zorro, etc.) and made it clear that all of these things were attainable by player characters...but then had an XP cost chart for new powers that was ridiculously expensive, and paired that with recommended XP awards that only dreamed of being described as "miserly," thus making it impossible to ever earn those abilities in the course of a typical game.  Grrr.  So infuriating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317574/#Comment_317574" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T09:44:37+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  9:44AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Offhand, it seems like the iconic style would be great for LARPs in that you want to spend time as your character and have interesting plot more than you want a power differential between you and everyone else.  <br/><br/>For advancement games, I think what players really want is more, rather than better.  In general, having more abilities allows for a greater variety of challenges (learning a new skill such as weaving might allow you to infiltrate the weaver's guild to root out a spy).  Getting better at a ability seems like it just leads to a lot of challenges that are similar but aren't any harder (e.g. a villager vs a wolf becomes a hero vs a dire wolf, are we having more fun yet?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317577/#Comment_317577" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T09:55:07+00:00" title="March 23, 2011  9:55AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Accounting seems to have the right of IMO.<br/><br/>WRT advancement games, how often have we seen ones that write in different types of advancement schemes for different playstyles? It strikes me that something like that could be really useful as well. Or, for that matter, games where characters are advancing at different rates ( Star Wars is the classic example of this to me; Luke is the only character that really advances in capability rapidly through the first movie, with most of the others being equally competent through the films).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317593/#Comment_317593" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T11:39:13+00:00" title="March 23, 2011 11:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do games like The Mountain Witch, Grey Ranks, Fiasco, Kagematsu, My Life with Master, etc. fit into this?<br/><br/>Your original post is confusing to me.  I thought you were going to compare long term, life-cycle games versus a "window in time" approach.<br/><br/>I don't have any frame of reference for the first, endless advancement type game.  My experience has been that those games will either peter out on their own, or that the characters usually run out of enemies, or become burdened with too many responsibilities to keep going, and hand things over to another generation.<br/><br/>The shifting points type of game seems like you need shifting challenges, with an escallation of stakes until you hit a stopping point.  Either way, the characters will probably hit a point where it's "safer" or more advantageous to throw in the towel, because the personal cost is just too great.  The fun there is the dialogue up to that point.<br/><br/>I don't know if any of this is helpful, as I'm always aiming towards (or at least aware of) an end point when gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317594/#Comment_317594" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-23T11:51:21+00:00" title="March 23, 2011 11:51AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Advancement is the Daddy of all Rpg for me, the driving power behind most games.<br/>\nIconic I have seen in a super hero's game, I think? which used a resource management type system.<br/>\nBut Iconic for me is more interesting..... managing the problems with your limited resources or looking at the problem in a different way.

I mean, ten kobolds in a cave are a real problem for a party of first-level characters, and not a problem at all for a party of fifth-level characters...but if you follow the usual advice about presenting characters with challenges appropriate to their power level, a party of fifth-level characters will never find ten kobolds in a cave.  That denies everyone at the table the opportunity to see <i>just how far they've come</i> since the start of the game, and kicks the idea that advancement is a kind of reward squarely in the crotch.<br/><br/>So the last time I ran a D&amp;D game, I made a note to myself when the party got mauled badly and barely survived an encounter, and later pulled that same basic encounter out again when they had some more levels under their belts so they could stomp all over it.  Despite the fact that there was no mechanical reward for doing it (the treasure and XP gained were so small as to be entirely irrelevant), everyone at the table spent the next four sessions basking in that moment, bringing it up in-character and out-of-character.  It was kind of a shock to me how well it went over, to be honest, and left me thinking that there's some kind of fundamental principle that needs to be re-examined about the nature of advancement and challenges in general, that the fun of barely overcoming a great challenge is actually magnified by being able to return to it later on and finding absolutely no challenge in it whatsoever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
