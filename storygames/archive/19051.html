My first GM was somewhat railroady.  I thought his style was roughly what GMs were supposed to do.  In retrospect, I think he interpreted the AD&amp;D book as saying "here's how to run encounters; between encounters, do whatever you want".  So, between encounters, he did what he wanted, using his GM powers to override the players when they wanted something different.  If that seems socially stupid, I should note that he was 10.<br/><br/>2. When I first GMed, I got very excited about the stories and characters I was making up before each session.  I wanted to present all my ideas in a certain way, and to have them be received as befit my vision.  The creepy guy had to seem creepy, the badass monster had to seem badass, the conspiracy had to produce urgent curiosity.  So if the players sneered at my creepy guy, quickly killed my monster, and didn't latch onto my conspiracy, it ruined the fun I was expecting.  Rather than searching for a different source of fun, I kept banging my head at this problem.  I tried various things, and some amount of railroading was effective some of the time.<br/><br/>The usual problems with railroading cropped up, so I mostly ditched it in the end, but certain techniques actually stood the test of time.  Specifically, scripted grand finales.  In college, my players all seemed to agree that being forced into my epic endings was a small price to pay for the epic endings themselves.<br/><br/>Usually, it went like this: I presented a bunch of revelations, set the fate of the world on the line, and then liberated the PCs to engage in battle.  From there, I split the difference between (a) fudging enemy stats to keep the fights close and exciting and (b) honoring player brilliance or extreme die rolls.  I tended to nudge toward the heroes prevailing, but if a badguy rolled a 20, you could still die.  The end result was super fun, and I'd do it again if I had a group I didn't have to deceive or manhandle to pull it off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425343/#Comment_425343" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T18:01:07+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  6:01PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I first did it it was because I was just starting and trying to run a very liniar adventure from a book. The book did only ever offer one path and option. So it was limiting and instructed me into that direction by omission of other options. I did not really enjoy that style of play, even if I could not name it really. For the next years I was doing more or less improvised stuff after that, using only source material and not adventures from books.<br/>Sometimes I did railroad too in those times. Because I felt that my idea was that good or important, but mostly it was collaborative. The impetus for that railroading was having only a narrow idea or a story to tell, not a roleplaying game scenario. It got less railroady as I learned.<br/><br/>Today I sometimes use railroading still. Well at least the players know they are on rails for a little part of the scenario. Often it is because I do run something from a book that needs a sequence of things to happen. Which especially playing in Games with a metaplot has to happen to stay within that plot. But I am pretty open about it, when I do and the players agree with it. Because we want to play in that metaplot and some things have to happen to exprience it and keep it going as it is for the other players of the game.<br/>So the reason there is that railroady parts are part of the concept and the style of the game we as a group choose to play. And there is always the option to go of the rails if we as a group really want and play in an "alternate reality" to the normal setting. But that only happend for minor things, like "who rules a town and shows up later" or "what year did that happen again?". Not one of the really big events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425345/#Comment_425345" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T18:14:57+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  6:14PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2013 6:17PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Because we want to play in that metaplot and some things have to happen to experience it and keep it going as it is for the other players of the game.</blockquote>Well said.

Sometimes railroading is the preferred way, sometimes it's not. It depends on what kind of feel you want from play. It's important however that everybody knows what's expected of them.

The one repeated reason I've found myself railroading rather recently is this.<br/><br/>We have a player in our group who is a professional actor, well read and a generally great creative guy. He's often a real ornament to a game and some of his improvisations are brilliant. He does however have a bad habit of seizing the stage and not yielding it gracefully to other players. Several of our players are quieter and not comfortable saying "Hey can we move on here" when he's holding forth even if they have things they badly want to do (either IC or OOC) in the game. He also has a habit of pushing universes as far as they will go, to the point that often his characters are just BARELY operating in the same sphere as the other characters. <br/><br/>For awhile, and with some of our GMs in some games this became a real difficulty. The other players at the table would get bored and check out and when someone else finally did manage to focus pull, half the table would be totally out of the game and we'd essentially be back to a cold start. Talking with him, either alone or as a group, didn't seem to help.<br/><br/>What finally did help is gently introducing some rail road elements to push his scenes back to a point where the other characters could engage rather than spectate. It's worked well, he seems to respond to it better than the other methods of dealing with the problem. Giving him something to react too/ineract with - even if the interactions were sharply limited in the interest of getting him back to the community space- did a good job of pulling the group back into collaboration.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425350/#Comment_425350" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T18:44:43+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  6:44PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I railroaded in some modules because they said to; if you asked me back then why they said to I think I would have said "because that's where the adventure/excitement is".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425355/#Comment_425355" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T01:29:08+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  1:29AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2013 1:29AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't run many games, but I'm sure if I tried I could probably think of at least a few more examples than these. Still, here's some:<br/><br/>1. It was a superhero game, so at some point the good guys HAVE to have a big confrontation with the final villain in his lair. And since it was going to be five against one (and some disposable goons), I decided without any consultation, roll, or justification that he was ready for them when they broke in, no matter what their brilliant plan was, so that I could do a proper Villain Monologue followed by an "unexpected" opportunity to escape the inescapable deathtrap and kick off the ruckus. It was kind of a dirty trick and reaaaaaally obvious, but genre-appropriate, so I don't feel as bad about it as I maybe should.<br/><br/>2. It was a kind of noir fantasy detective game, and I simply blew it. I forgot one of the PC's big magical abilities, and it was 100% going to short-circuit the entire mystery in a single simple roll (basically all she had to do was touch this clue and it'd all be over). And right when she announced that she was going to take a look at the clue, I panicked and misapplied Raymond Chandler's advice and sent in the proverbial man with a gun. Who distracted them from the uncatchable thief. Without having to roll anything. It was just a rank, inexcusable fuckup on my part, and it didn't even help much -- it ended up pushing them into an immediately aggressive, paranoid style of play, and all of the fun I anticipated having playing the various NPCs they were going to end up talking to just got thrown in the trash, because they weren't in a talking mood anymore. In retrospect, I probably would have been better off letting them solve it right off the bat and then trying to improvise a second mystery for the next two hours (pretending that I meant for them to solve that one so quickly). Dumb, dumb, dumb.<br/><br/>3. I have a tendency in combat-heavy games to start cheating in the player's favor when a fight has gone on for what feels like too long to me. D&amp;D games where the demon with 90hp dies after taking a total of 50 points of damage, that kind of thing. And I've been caught at it, too, by experts who pay attention to how much damage they've dealt to a monster and remember how many hit points that monster should have. Which is embarrassing, but...honestly, I'll probably keep doing it. Draggy pacing is draggy pacing, even if the rules say we're supposed to keep rolling dice for another half-hour anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425357/#Comment_425357" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T01:31:49+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  1:31AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I railroaded because I wanted a meaningful story leading up to a climax where the characters would eventually triumph. <br/><br/>I was playing with the wrong rules for the type of game I wanted, but didn't have the insight to see that at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425358/#Comment_425358" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T01:44:32+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  1:44AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2013 1:50AM by Golux.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't stopped railroading.

They go because they want to play the game I'm running.  If they didn't they wouldn't be there.  We're all on board with railroading or we wouldn't be sitting at the same table.<br/><br/>The only thing that changed in how I run games now is that there has to be something going on before narrative can flow freely... so the start of all my games all start with one of two premises.  <br/><br/>1. Go to this place and see the adventure I started... we'll work it out from there.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2.  This is the scenario you find yourself in. Deal with it... the adventure started without you.  <br/><br/>2 is the same as 1 without the invitation to turn it down because we're already in media res.<br/><br/>I use 2 for con games because I don't want to fight with ornery players.<br/><br/>I think it happened initially because I read some modules (which I never wanted to run because I always considered modules were like cheating) and they're always pretty railroady.

When I changed my game master style to sometimes instead react to what the players did, I also had to change how I wrote scenarios.</blockquote>\nIn addition, and I'm mostly write this in a philosophical way, most stories that we are facing daily are railroaded in structure. If we read a book, a comic or watch a movie or TV serie, they all have a fixed storyline. So it's natural to think roleplaying games could be played in the same way. I'm suspecting that if impro were a bigger part of our lives, railroading wouldn't come as natural.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425362/#Comment_425362" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T02:43:21+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  2:43AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to really enjoy gaming with my first GM.

Typically I've allowed more freedom that was scripted in and ended up having to do some improvising, or just ended up with some sort of error, but on occasion I've been tempted by some particular thing that was cool or nostalgic or what-have-you. I picked up Rogue Mistress for Stormbringer fairly recently for instance, because OMG Michael Moorcock and sailing ships with laser cannons!! and *nearly* ran it, but on reflection just couldn't do it.  <br/>From a module writer perspective of course railroading makes perfect sense....less plot paths to prepare. There are a few modules that are well-written to support freer play (thinking of e.g. some of Paul (Jenelle) Jacquays stuff, like The Enchanted Wood for Dragonquest many moons ago) but it was probably much easier for companies to write linear adventures, and that all too often became a model for aspiring gamers.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425366/#Comment_425366" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T03:51:20+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  3:51AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The traditional roleplaying games that we played when I started gaming in the early '90s all advocated railroading, simple as that. The games that I GMed early, including LotR Adventure Game, Call of Cthulhu, Cyberpunk 2020, Paranoia, Twilight 2000, Runequest (yes, it's a strongly '80s line-up - Finland tended to play slightly older games than America at the time), all included or involved sample adventures and GMing advice that are more likely to make you railroad than not. The same goes for the rpg zines of the time. Specifically, the adventure-writing scheme of the time is hopelessly railroady: once you're writing your events in a chronological order, you're practically ensuring that a railroad emerges, no matter how much empty verbiage you might or might not waste in encouraging player freedom.<br/><br/>The outcome of this textual environment is that my understanding of rpg adventure design through the 90s was strictly centered upon the aesthetic setpiece or theme: you created an adventure or an entire campaign by getting a literary detail or atmosphere from somewhere (a book or a movie, perhaps), and then you constructed a framework that enabled you to present your artistic inspiration to the players in a powerful manner.  This framework generally meant a railroad of some sort, bringing the viewpoint characters to the central point of the adventure via an appropriately paced progression of preparatory scenes. The brand of railroading with us was always pretty mild and let's say weak-willed: the GM would and could roll over when the players did not go along with his illusionist techniques. (We had our overt force moment as well, but it was more common for a game to go awry because the players wandered off the rails and we didn't know how to continue play when lacking a plot.) Nevertheless, nothing came of play when the players broke the railroad, so the alternatives basically were to quit the campaign as a fail, or once in a blue moon the players would bounce in the right direction. Needless to say, our pattern of play through these years involved many short campaigns.<br/><br/>In hindsight, the only rpg of the time that could maybe have reversed the trend, had we partaken of it early enough, was the D&amp;D red box. Unfortunately it only got into my hands at a time when I was already entirely inculcated with the aforementioned simmy auteur GMing paradigm, and thus I could see nothing in the red box except a game from more primitive times, one that does not e.g. simulate a player character as a fully bodied individual in as skilled a manner as BRP does.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425375/#Comment_425375" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T05:35:35+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  5:35AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            because of a lack of tools and techniques to make player choices more relevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425383/#Comment_425383" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T08:58:24+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  8:58AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I railroaded because all the stuff I was reading was telling me that I-as-GM was responsible for the fun, and that it wouldn't be fun unless I manipulated things so that the players succeeded and thought they were succeeding because of their own skill.

There are some great, easy-to-apply houserules that, IME, feel more satisfying. Like, monsters tend to run away or look for opportunities to escape at half HP.

The games that I GMed early, including LotR Adventure Game, Call of Cthulhu, Cyberpunk 2020, Paranoia, Twilight 2000, Runequest (yes, it's a strongly '80s line-up - Finland tended to play slightly older games than America at the time), all included or involved sample adventures and GMing advice that are more likely to make you railroad than not. The same goes for the rpg zines of the time. Specifically, the adventure-writing scheme of the time is hopelessly railroady: once you're writing your events in a chronological order, you're practically ensuring that a railroad emerges, no matter how much empty verbiage you might or might not waste in encouraging player freedom.<br/><br/>The outcome of this textual environment is that my understanding of rpg adventure design through the 90s was strictly centered upon the aesthetic setpiece or theme: you created an adventure or an entire campaign by getting a literary detail or atmosphere from somewhere (a book or a movie, perhaps), and then you constructed a framework that enabled you to present your artistic inspiration to the players in a powerful manner.  This framework generally meant a railroad of some sort, bringing the viewpoint characters to the central point of the adventure via an appropriately paced progression of preparatory scenes. The brand of railroading with us was always pretty mild and let's say weak-willed: the GM would and could roll over when the players did not go along with his illusionist techniques. (We had our overt force moment as well, but it was more common for a game to go awry because the players wandered off the rails and we didn't know how to continue play when lacking a plot.) Nevertheless, nothing came of play when the players broke the railroad, so the alternatives basically were to quit the campaign as a fail, or once in a blue moon the players would bounce in the right direction. Needless to say, our pattern of play through these years involved many short campaigns.<br/></blockquote>\nThanks, Eero. As a child of the 90s, this reflect my exact experiences.

The setting and flavour are fine stuff, and the character generation is insanely ambitious for the time - there are very, very few games from this period that so explicitly position player characters in different social classes and positions, giving you an overview of the postmodern cyberpunk society. I mean, you could play a rock star or a journalist in the game, not just street warriors of various flavours. Of course all this was used for the usual "random assortment of misfits get a mission" play, but that was more of a failure of execution and not the scope of the vision.<br/><br/>And yes, the game had some pretty sand-boxy, challengeful-seeming materials at times, despite this actually bringing incoherence to it more than anything else. (I do not think that the Cyberpunk 2020 character generation process is compatible with a free sandbox game - too complex character backgrounds, and takes too much time; you have to do something story-like with characters like that, I think.) Our particular cargo cult in the Finnish outback had little chance of picking up on the alternate possibilities, though, being as how we were reading everything through our singularly railroady eye-glasses, and it's not like any of these games go out of their way to abuse you of your notions. As I often say: the traditional playstyle is, above all else, the style of playing all games the same way, supported by the ambiguity and lack of procedure in the traditional game text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425452/#Comment_425452" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T15:42:44+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  3:42PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of great points in this thread. I was, personally, definitely subject to the following:<br/><br/>1. Game texts advised that "the GM has a plot in mind; the players take on the roles of characters within that plot". That implies a certain linear planning on the part of the GM.<br/><br/>2. Examples of modules/adventures made this even more clear: there's a pre-written plot, and we play through it.<br/><br/>3. We didn't have any other good procedures to get going - everyone would just sit around and chew the scenery until the GM threw in the "plot hook" (or threat, or whatever) - so a certain level of railroading was required to "get the motor running".<br/><br/>4. The GM typically had a strong artistic/auteuristic vision s/he wanted to present: that's not as easy to do without railroading.<br/><br/>5. The fiction we were emulating often had railroady elements (e.g. the Lord of the Rings!), and it seemed natural to reflect that in the fictional stories we were creating.<br/><br/>(I remember in the first D&amp;D campaign I ran, I even forced (!!!) a player to play a character class he didn't want to play, because he'd told me earlier that he wanted to play that kind of character, and I'd already made BIG plans for him. Yikes!)<br/><br/>However, there were some other factors which haven't come up but I think were significant, at least for me:<br/><br/><br/>a. It was very clear that railroading, however much it was important to hide it (because we all knew it was "bad", someone had read about it in some magazine somewhere), was largely responsible for the fun at the table. Like Dave's Epic Endings, the games which involved some hard railroading tended to be the most successful and fun ones - the loose, improvised ones were generally quite weak or unfocused in comparison. <br/><br/>So, as a GM, I knew that I had to bring some of that to the table to make a good game. Improvising was an option, but it just wouldn't leave people as impressed, or create as much fun for the whole group. (Yes, we firmly believed that the GM was responsible for the fun of the group!)<br/><br/>If you want to run a really good game, you expected yourself to lay down some rails and drive them hard - because those were the games that impressed people the most, if you could pull it off without anyone noticing. (And sometimes they'd happily overlook it, too, if you didn't accidentally step on anyone's toes.)<br/><br/><br/>b. Almost every single gamer I met until I was in university was heavily indoctrinated by what I call the Mystery GM Cult.<br/><br/>The GM is a guru and a magician, and to reveal any kind of weakness or any kind of secret was verboten. I saw every GM making a mysterious face and ominously saying, "Yes, that's just what I expected you to do along! Haha!" whenever a player did something surprising or unexpected. Naturally, as a GM, I felt I had to do the same thing, or I was failing at being a good GM.<br/><br/>You were expected to keep up the appearance of being in perfect control of everything that was happening, to know every detail, and not to be surprised or be caught off-guard by anything that happened. Because that's what good GMs were like - practically gods, all-knowing, ready for every eventuality, like some kind of comic villain: "Excellent, everything is proceeding according to plan..." (Sadly, often with maniacal cackling included, as cliche as that sounds.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425454/#Comment_425454" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T16:50:44+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  4:50PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There really should be a term for the intermediate sort of railroad, where the game runs more like a video game does, with a predetermined track that takes the PC's from scene to scene, but then quite a lot of freedom within the scene, as long as you manage to get back on the train for the next scene. Instead of a train, maybe call it a tour bus, which lets the passengers off at interesting locations but requires them to get back on to get to the next attraction.  <br/><br/>It's a step in between hard railroading and aggressive scene-framing, and I think it can be quite functional.  It has the virtues for a GM that you get to use your preparation, and there's always clarity about the next thing to do when you run out of steam in one scene.  It can be awkward if the PCs refuse to get back on the bus, though you can avoid this with careful player selection and training.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425462/#Comment_425462" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T19:44:41+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  7:44PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny you say that DannyK, as I remember learning about scene-framing/cutting and thinking it was an elegant solution to railroading and switched over to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425463/#Comment_425463" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T20:58:52+00:00" title="December  7, 2013  8:58PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Tour bus"!

I think I briefly wound up there, maybe early high school, and I'm trying to remember how.  <br/><br/>1) A player and GM want different things to happen in the fiction<br/>2) Because they're supposedly playing a defined game, they short-circuit their natural social ability to play nice together and instead battle to establish a "right answer" that supports their position<br/><br/>So, eventually the GM tries to make the battle impossible by simply refusing all opposition without explanation.  This is understandable, as the battles can:<br/><br/>a) Waste time and be no fun for anyone<br/>b) Interrupt the GM's creative and storytelling flow<br/>c) Cost the GM what they wanted to happen<br/><br/>It's easy to look at a power-tripping GM and think it's all (c).  However, in opposed situations, I recall being more <i>protective</i> of my power than anything else, <i>fearful</i> that puncturing it would be somehow disastrous.  To me, that sounds more like (a).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425470/#Comment_425470" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T04:30:05+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  4:30AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post Paul!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425497/#Comment_425497" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T18:23:30+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  6:23PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. To a degree, the fact that I started gming after Vampire: The Masquerade came out meant that I was very aware of "no matter what, shove the plot down their throats" as something that was generally not a good idea. So, I've less of an excuse than I might otherwise have. That did not, of course, translate to an utter lack of railroading.<br/><br/>Depending on how you define the term, I've railroaded because:<br/><br/>1. That's tonight's adventure, folks. Come up with a reason your PC is going along with it, maybe suggest how I can make a tweak that makes it work better.<br/><br/>2. Er... Okay, guys? I didn't go over this well enough, and the author insists one needs to do X. Help me dig us out of the hole I should have dealt with?<br/><br/>3. Idiocy. I gradually got better at catching that. Once, I kept trying to figure out how to cut off logical player options for something I'd come up with, and realized that if there were that many options I had to cut off, it was the WRONG PLOT. Ironically, I ran it anyway because one player couldn't make it at the last minute and cleared me for doing nasty things to his PC so long as they could be undone. This meant I didn't have to railroad for the rest of the players. But, if that hadn't happened, I would've junked the plot. I was way too in love with my idea of what should happen.<br/><br/>4. Being unaware of options. One player, a very good sport about something I did, said, "Here's how you could have given my character a chance to avoid that -- and I understand you would not have thought of this on your own because you don't get how that particular bit of technology actually works." Chatting with other GMs, using wikipedia and other online sources, asking players what you can without diminishing their enjoyment of surprise (if you're into surprising your players, which I often am), and so on can help here.<br/><br/>5. Genre convention, especially if the system supports it. "Yep, the bad guy does get away -- have a fate point, everyone."<br/><br/>And probably more I'm failing to recall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425502/#Comment_425502" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T21:48:05+00:00" title="December  8, 2013  9:48PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Three things:<br/><br/>1) IME, the "PCs are hired to X thing" is actually pretty great, as long as you're upfront about it. Definitely an example of the good kind of "railroading". Provided that you have some creative freedom as to how you go about doing X. (And of course it's much much better if the clock is ticking.)<br/><br/>2) I've definitely been part of the whole "GM has a grand auteuristic vision and wants to share it" thing, but I've only seen it truly work a small handful of times, and crash and burn much more often. I certainly don't think I could pull it off.<br/><br/>3) I often make the stupid, Yakov Smirnov "In Soviet indie gaming, players railroad GM!" joke, but I think for certain frameworks there is some truth to it. That is, someone has to take responsibility for framing the overall parameters of the game, and many setups actually put this in the players' hands. (The third option is for that framing to be all or mostly in the designer's hands, like DitV or Lady Blackbird.) I mean, look at something like Burning Wheel or TSOY/SS or even FATE. The GM is pretty much obligated to prep things that will ping off what the players say they're interested in. Failure to do so\u2014and I've seen it!\u2014is both a serious breach of social contract and takes the game straight to Suckville really fast.<br/><br/>Of course the GM\u2014or, ideally, the whole group\u2014in such situations has to approve all Beliefs/Aspects/whatever.<br/><br/>Now, I certainly don't buy that these setups rob the GM of all meaningful creative input. Anymore than a game where the players OOC agree to go into a particular dungeon denies them the opportunity to decide how to play their characters or approach the challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425504/#Comment_425504" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T22:18:01+00:00" title="December  8, 2013 10:18PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait.

I made these NPCs which were a sort of Mary Sue when they were put together. A couple ace pilots, an AI connected to a comatose hacker able to find out almost anything going on, an expert thief who lead an army of thief kids able to rob any place clean, a not-so undercover human cyborg able to deal with full-sized (unarmed) zentraedy (with mere quick thinking, not brute force) and all lead by an ex drug-lord with good connections (or bad blackmail on the right people)<br/><br/>I only went full force in the first session, having one of these characters either outmaneuver or surprise each party member to convince the group that following their orders was a good idea. Made it so players didn't had to make many rolls against them nor they got affected in a too permanent way (one meltrandi PC got robbed all the equipment I gave her for free, but got it back when she presented (quite angered at first) to the HQ to retrieve it and receive orders; the intel agent had it worse, being found out by the hacker and turned into a double agent through some more blackmail)<br/><br/>However this had the effect of making the life of each PC more interesting and afterwards there were sandbox moments, and moments where I run a couple of pre-scripted events I prepared each session. Did I denied players their input? no. Did I ever fudge dice? No, though I admit I switched from palladium's d100 to d20 after a few sessions because it was too lethal for my npcs. Did I took meaningful decisions out of the hands of my players? Of course, but only when that translated into setting an specific mood to the game ("you're either part of the merc army or it's enemy") The rest of the time, they were on their own.<br/><br/>On almost the totally opposite of the spectre, on the last campaign GMed players were in the middle of a randomly generated dungeon which felt endless. On some room I improvised a painting that inspired the players and they asked if they could start their own religious group and make a stand instead of chasing all the villains and the plot through the whole setting. I found the idea so interesting that I threw away most of the prep I had (fortunately it wasn't too much nor it had good quality) improvised some mechanics for resource management, convincing large groups of people and training them. Each party member trained apprentices in some of their class skills (except for the cleric, who started to train fanatics into suicide bombers) and they had a lot of fun creating a whole new religion in the setting. By far it was one of the best moments of that whole campaign.<br/><br/>For my next campaign I want to find a middle point between railroading and letting the players railroad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425725/#Comment_425725" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-12T11:54:32+00:00" title="December 12, 2013 11:54AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think railroading happens when someone at the table has a future outcome firmly in mind, and stops responding to what other players are saying/doing when it doesn't line up with their expectations.</blockquote>\nI think this is something that can occur in railroading, but it's something that should stand on it's own legs when it comes to definitions.

It was remarkably fun for everyone. The fact that the path was fixed didn't interfere at all, because everyone was just having fun overcoming the challenges I set.<br/><br/>The group I chose to run for were powergamers. They were good enough at it to put even me to shame, but they wanted to try something a bit different. L5R was the perfect game to bridge that gap because it allows powergaming, but it also involves a lot of social play. <br/><br/>Eventually, one of the players did a little bit of improvising, taking his character in an unexpected direction. I rewarded that. The game was still on rails, but it was redirected so that he could explore that aspect of his character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425740/#Comment_425740" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-12T21:52:52+00:00" title="December 12, 2013  9:52PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 12, 2013 9:57PM by David_Berg.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!

So we did it. I did it. A lot, and I think it didn't really dawn on me until 2002 or so that is was why my roleplaying was so unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>In Scandinavia (at least in Denmark and Sweden) there was a whole convention scenario culture built around this, and it still exists to some extent today. It was the ruling thought, and I still know people who will fanatically defend this, that scenario writers and game masters had to be in charge of "the story", in order to give the players a good experience. The GM developed into an entertainer that led their audience, the players, through a game experience, possibly with props, scenography and funny voices/shouting, with everyone pretending that it was roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425746/#Comment_425746" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T05:24:28+00:00" title="December 13, 2013  5:24AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2013 5:26AM by Paul88.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why did you railroad?<br/><br/>Because im not omnipresent and the knower of all things cool? or <br/><br/>I tried to create thrilling worlds for adventure but, 7 times out of 10 that dramatic build up or climatic ending felt forced or broken.<br/><br/>70% of railroading came about from the system, crap rolls, missing information or meta game taboos.<br/><br/><br/>Thats probably why I don't role play as much these days. getting the system up to speed with the story is a pain.<br/><br/>Simulation role play is like trying to see the love with a roll of 17 or more. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Why did you railroad? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19051/why-did-you-railroad/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Why did you railroad? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19051/why-did-you-railroad/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Well, let's be fair.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, let's be fair. Even on the thread about railroading, there was no real consensus on what exactly constituted railroading. All anybody could seem to agree on was that it was an unpleasant experience where choices became more constricted than players felt were appropriate and when the GM used force to constrict those choices unexpectedly during the game.<br/><br/>Let's see, my use of force since we're being all confessional here.<br/><br/>I've used it Call of Cthulhu scenarios when it seemed to me like the players were getting wildly off track of the core concept of that game <i>as I understand it.</i><br/><br/><b>How I understand it</b>: CoC is a Lovecraft flavored adventure game ( usually set in the 1920s). A mystery ( in nodes of encounters/info) replaces the physical dungeon of dungeon crawly style D&amp;D. It isn't really "sandbox world with scattered dungeons" style D&amp;D. It's more like Dungeon of the Week style D&amp;D.<br/><br/>So getting the basic set up for the mystery hook is a whole lot like starting at the dungeon door. Or maybe in town and quickly getting to the dungeon door. Whatever.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D (Dungeon of the Week style), you make adventurous adventurers who are going to explore and run through that dungeon with an eye towards getting the maximum loot without dying and the players are fully aware there's probably a monster somewhere deep down a couple of levels and really great loot down there, so <i>dayum</i>, they plunge forward at it as best they can figure out. They don't dick around forever in town talking to every barmaid and they don't set up shop in town ( at least not during actual play session time), and they don't piss off for parts unknown without at least attempting the dungeon. That would be pretty much completely at odds with the core concept of the game.<br/><br/>Right, I'm sure you an already see the parallels with CoC.<br/><br/>Well, when I've used various force techniques in CoC, it's largely because some of the players seemed to not understand the core concept the way I did <b>and</b> I felt those techniques were a better choice than stopping the game, dropping entirely out of the fiction and discussing the issue.<br/><br/>Today, I might do that. I might call time out and talk about the core concept of the thing and see if the players really grok it. I might drop out and say something like "Look, talking to this guy clearly isn't going to give you more information" rather than completely improv'ing for a year and a day in-character as an NPC. <br/><br/>Heck, I might even be willing to simply let things completely fall apart and everybody die off-screen if PCs really abandon a mystery without doing much to stop the badness.<br/><br/>That has changed for me anyway.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425756/#Comment_425756" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T08:02:41+00:00" title="December 13, 2013  8:02AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I didn't try sandboxing with this group. I'd pre-judged their ability, and decided that railroading (and a bit of illusionism) was the way to go, for both myself and them. The funny thing about railroading is that while the plot is tightly controlled, it relies on the players to drive the train (aka to follow the plot). Improv tries to drive the train somewhere else. As mentioned above, there was one incident of improv with the character concept. Rather than shutting it down, I decided to reward it by redirecting the plot. Improv may be the holy grail of story games, but its not all that important to other types of play (eg powergaming).<br/><br/>Actually, I would argue that powergamers prefer to improv with the rules, creating solutions mathematically, not the plot or the characters. Hmmm, this has got me thinking about all the different ways to improv.

When do players not mind giving up plot control? When they are interested in other aspects of the game: the tactical combat between cut-scenes, etc. In those cases, though, you can still railroad them by making their input meaningless in areas they do care about. That is, since they care about the tactical combats, making those meaningless ("You didn't know it, but I was fudging all the monster stats so you would have won no matter what you did") would bother them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425758/#Comment_425758" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T09:14:44+00:00" title="December 13, 2013  9:14AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 13, 2013 9:18AM by Paul_T.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that most groups I played with bought heavily into the whole "the GM comes up with the plot, the players portray characters within it" paradigm.<br/><br/>What's interesting to me is when that mindset starts to bring second-order effects. In other words, once that becomes the established way to play, what else follows?<br/><br/>Character background/backstory is a notable effect. When players expect to have no impact on the plot, they write information about the character in a very different way. I've seen people go far out of their way to a) create dramatic and meaningful story in their character's past - but resist you whole-heartedly if you try to bring any of that story into the actual game, and b) avoid offering you anything that can actually be used in play, since that's "not their job". I doubt they're consciously aware of these tendencies; it's just "how things are done". <br/><br/>I've never seen a newbie engage in this kind of behaviour.<br/><br/>I recently tried to run a game of Apocalypse World for a group of D&amp;D gamers where I asked players something like, "Hey, before we get together again, can you name one NPC in the game who your character cares about the most, and one your character fears the most? You can make up a new NPC, if you want." (This was going into our third session, I think.)<br/><br/>The answers took a lot longer than I expected. What were they taking so long doing?<br/><br/>It turned out they were writing character backgrounds.<br/><br/>Just for fun, a sample of a response:\n<blockquote>Crimson, born screaming and nameless to her dying mother, found little love in the world where she grew up, inland, east of the Rockies - if it has been a very long time since the downfall of society, I suggest Spine of Merk, and that it be prowled by twisted and dangerous new species of bear, coyote, wolf and cougar.  If not, then not <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>An orphan in a drifter hub, Red, as she was known then, lived through bullying rather than theft.  She had smaller, weaker kids steal the food for her.  Whatever it took to get by in a place without pity.  Banditry eventually looked like a profitable business and she took to it with gusto.  In a couple of years she headed her own small band of brigands, and had adopted the name that she would carry from then on, Crimson.  Crimson tended to act as if a bandit was a rock star, and lived life accordingly, drugs and groupies and all. Crimson is a fullon junkie of the flesh; she likes good food, rough sex, powerful drugs, the smell of blood and the shock of a sword hitting bone. <br/><br/>Crimson wants nothing more than to drink deep of the cup of life, and to get rich and famous doing it, with none of the responsibilities that come with leadership.  To be free and high until the day she dies in battle is all she demands.  She came to the Reef, over the mountains, on a rumor of great power and wealth, braving the mutant Wyewolves and Plasmabears, the Nucoyotes and Sawtooth Cougars.  She had not yet found that wealth or power, but the Reef was as good a place as any to stay and get wasted for a while [...]</blockquote>\nIt goes on like this for quite a while. Every location mentioned, every element mentioned, is not something from our game, but clearly something from the Past, in a different place far away. (We'd established that the game was taking place on a bit of a floating island in the middle of the ocean.) <br/><br/>For instance, the player is quite clear that elements like the "small band of brigands" are in the past - they do not appear in our game.<br/><br/>I've seen this type of player create sparkling characterization, cool in-character voices, and dramatic dialogue... all while very carefully not introducing anything to the game which could potentially derail or affect the current plot. If there's a villain on the stage, they'll yell insults and shout about revenge and how they will take them down and how horrible they are, then wait for something to happen. But they will not create a cunning plan to short-circuit the villain's plan, or try to join the villain themselves, or anything else that has the potential to turn the plot 90 degrees.<br/><br/>I feel like I've seen this quite consistently across different groups.

Keeping it compartmentalized could be considered a form of courtesy to the GM: you're not imposing on his master plan by dragging in your own elements.  Also, from a game balance issue, you might argue that putting "band of brigands" in your backstory but not buying "Contacts: Band of Brigands" at chargen could be a form of powergaming -- you're trying to get the benefits of backgrounds you haven't paid for while keeping your precious points for enhancing your cool powers.  <br/><br/>I think this is a coherent approach to gaming, just not one that I enjoy very much any more.  I've dropped out of several appealing White Wolf games in the past year because I couldn't bear the process  of going from character concept to finished character sheet. <br/><br/>EDIT: Humorous aside: I'm currently running "Ghost Lines", and this thread amuses me because I'm running a story game set on a literal railroad, and it does have some of the same advantages as railroading -- the player characters are trapped on the train until it reaches the station and constrained in their options, and it really does make things easier as GM!                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425772/#Comment_425772" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T14:53:50+00:00" title="December 13, 2013  2:53PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I feel like I've seen this quite consistently across different groups.

Sometimes the players understood that there are different styles, where they could contribute with their backstory or develop it in game. Some of them liked it, some didn't.<br/>I know of The Dark Eye as well as White Wolf groups where it was expected to write up a backstory for your character. Usually in great, often unhelpfully so, detail. It wasn't always expected that the stuff did not matter but it was more or less expected to become stops on the GM's railroad. And often, to come back at what DannyK mentioned the character background was especially used to "justify" the purchased Stats and Backgrounds.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425776/#Comment_425776" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T18:05:58+00:00" title="December 13, 2013  6:05PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In actual early White Wolf texts it was a straight up mechanical mistake not to buy your best Backgrounds (basically cool things from your character's pre-game activities) at character creation because there was no mechanical opportunity to buy them later, only "if the GM allowed it".

And most local GMs who ran other systems like Dark Heresy/Cthulhu had the whole "write a background for your character and get bonus XP", but then folks would either never bring up their past, or would only bring it up in "free roleplay" moments to help characterization, but would never use it to directly affect the vector of the GM's plot.<br/><br/>I've noticed this can work fine-and-dandy as long as the players agree with the tone/direction of the game and the game allows them to play their character in a way that they deem fun/consistent with their vision.  But the minute the GM takes the story/setting in a direction that clashes with the perception that the players have for the story/setting, there's trouble, but a lot of players will not speak up because they don't feel it's their place to critique the GM on how they're handling the fictional stuff, even if they would gladly call the GM out on a mechanical ruling.  So the game putters out as it continues off in a direction some players just aren't interested in.<br/><br/>In an Exalted game I ran a years ago, I noticed the players were initially really excited about playing, but as I started to shift the tone of the story they became less and less enthusiastic, even though they were telling me "Yeah, great session" after every game.  One night it was so obvious I broke trad GM protocol, stopped the game, told the players what plot-points I had planned, and asked them to critique and offer their own input for what they would like to see.  I re-worked that evening's adventure to include the group's input, and it resulted in one of the most memorable and fun sessions of gaming I've ever had.  The players were super excited to play their characters through a scenario that brought out what they thought was cool about their dudes and what they thought was cool about the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425803/#Comment_425803" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-14T16:13:26+00:00" title="December 14, 2013  4:13PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Vampire group I did try that once, asking for suggestions about what they wanted in the game.

Mainly:<br/><br/>-All of us had been high-school friends, so the comfort/trust level was super-high<br/>-We had been playing for several sessions, there was an existing baseline to riff off of<br/>-Everyone had gone in with strong ideas of what they wanted their character to be<br/><br/>Also, slightly less important, but still a factor, was that none of us posted online or interacted with the broader RPG community beyond the RPGA sessions we had played when we were younger, so while books hinted at the GM being a sort of "leader", we didn't feel beholden to any sort of subcultural standards or ideals about how RPGs "should" be run.  Even before our Exalted game, we used to help eachother build encounters and prep for adventures if the GM was having a rough week.  So maybe the transition into letting players help build the narrative parts of the adventure was just an extension of the sort of burden-sharing we'd developed.  We knew it was unusual and not really in the book's advice, but it worked, so *shrug*.<br/><br/>All-in-all maybe a bit of a perfect storm -- that group was one of two I've played with that have had that perfect rock-and-roll garage-band flow where everything just seems to click.  If it hadn't been that group, I may have been tempted to continue to just set the plot-points and scenes myself to keep things on track or out of fear of intimidating newer players or people I didn't know so well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425851/#Comment_425851" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-16T20:14:33+00:00" title="December 16, 2013  8:14PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2013 8:15PM by Deliverator.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, another, very simple reason I've railroaded: because prep would be insanely burdensome in some setups if you were to include genuinely meaningful plot forks.<br/><br/>ETA: Where by "setup" I mean some combination of mechanical system and campaign framework; I'm thinking here of "epic fantasy quest" 3.X/PF (as opposed to more sandboxy, dungeon-crawly incarnations of those systems).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426020/#Comment_426020" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T07:42:15+00:00" title="December 19, 2013  7:42AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2014 11:17AM by thadrine.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I started, that is just what you did.

I\u2019ve had to revise some statements in my previous posting. I hope it\u2019s enough detail for you.<br/><br/>These players were used to railroading in every way. Their previous DM railroaded everything, characters, plot, and villains, to crush the characters and therefore the players. Their defense was to push the rules to their limits, and occasionally beyond. I was a newcomer to the group, which had shed its original DM. I wanted to run L5R instead of their usual D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I have a habit where I design a challenge, then think up one or two ways the character could fail. Any other effort towards overcoming the challenge succeeds. They were pretty straight-line thinkers, always looking for fights, but I tried to mix in a few challenges where fighting was irrelevant. Actually, they were a bit better at problem-solving than I gave them credit for, both in my initial post and at the time.<br/><br/>Anyways, after a while one of them chose to give up his status as a samurai (not quite an event so much as a process). This was what I refer to as the episode of character improvisation. Thinking back, it wasn\u2019t the only occasion where character improvisation. I\u2019m sorry, I retract my previous claim.<br/><br/>The player whose character had given up his status was allowed to keep his character in the second half of the campaign. All other players were asked to create new characters. The player who had been allowed to keep his character chose for his character to become a special sort of monk/samurai (something I almost didn\u2019t let him do, a hesitancy which I regret to this day, and another example of a process, not an event).<br/><br/>There were a few new players to the group in the second half of the campaign. One of them did point out that the plot was on rails, but that he didn\u2019t care because he was having so much fun. The other players were surprised by this, because they were so used to everything being railroaded that they hadn\u2019t noticed. They were taught by their previous DM that the social contract was supposed to be more restrictive.<br/><br/>To answer your question about defining improvisation, initially they weren\u2019t able to improvise with anything non-mechanical. They were so used to having their other suggestions shut down that they looked to the rules for support against their perceived enemy (the DM).<br/><br/>While not every player took the opportunity I provided to explore their characters, it was entertaining whenever it was attempted. By the end I wouldn\u2019t have asked them to frame a scene on the fly, but I might have asked a couple of them to add some detail to their characters midway through the game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426124/#Comment_426124" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-20T16:22:04+00:00" title="December 20, 2013  4:22PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.  That's really interesting!  Some of my early groups had phases like that, but our "rules vs the GM" play never got extreme enough to exclude doing other stuff in the fiction.  My groups actually spent a ton of time on fictional positioning to establish the strongest possible supporting evidence for their rules-use efforts.  Accordingly, any GM attempts to say, "Here's where you are and what's going on; now this thing happens while you passively watch," were strongly resisted.<br/><br/>Am I correct in inferring that your players were more passive, simply waiting for a moment of "I can do a thing with a rule"?<br/><br/>If so, then yeah, I can totally see why you went a railroady route -- given what you'd seen of these players, anything else would have been a total paradigm shift.  Not only did they expect it, but they'd come to define "how I work with being railroaded" as "roleplaying".  I've definitely encountered players like that (though I've never GMed for a whole group of them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427158/#Comment_427158" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-14T11:01:52+00:00" title="January 14, 2014 11:01AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I necro with a more recent example?<br/><br/>So, my PMON campaign. The PCs need to get from Africa to Australia. When I prepped, my original thought was to either make it not important, or to just let the players come up with their own method.<br/><br/>But then I began to think: it might be interesting to make the trip over be an actual event; it's not been done very often in the campaign, where travel is either a montage or a brief character scene in between the plottier elements.<br/><br/>At some point, poking around with travel times, I hit upon an interesting fact: the time for a clipper ship to travel from Africa to Australia was roughly comparable to the time a steamship would take. (The South 40s of Latitude have perpetual west to east winds blowing.)<br/><br/>This seemed too cool not to do, and I thought my PCs would enjoy the exotic means of transport. So...I pushed them towards it.<br/><br/>After that, hey, I had already thought some kind of crew mutiny organized by the cults would be good, and I had a bit on a floating ship full of dead people that was a clue I wanted to drop in somewhere, so those went in.<br/><br/>So I railroaded my crew onto a boat. But I knew they would like it, and they needed a way to get to Australia. Plus, it was actually beneficial for them to drop off the map for a while (a steamship wouldn't cross the Indian Ocean direct, it would call at ports along the way, all of which would give the cults a chance to locate the PCs.)<br/><br/>And more: when they found the death ship, I threw out an unplanned detail about how the bridge crew had been ripped to pieces inside a locked room. One of the players expressed interest in finding out what did the ripping.<br/><br/>Here I paused. We'd already spent a huge chunk of the session on the boat, and I really didn't think this was an important detail. But. A player was interested...so I out and out asked them, if they thought this would be interesting to pursue, or if they wanted to just go straight on to Australia. They were happy with either, so we went with the "let's find out and make it important" chain.<br/><br/>Had it not been important, they could quickly have assessed that it was a dimensional shambler, and that was that. But because they cared, it became a lloigor, an invisible telekinetic alien that can manifest as a sea serpent. So there was a lot of research, an interview with a temporarily insane PC (I played the PC, since the player was out), a surprise visit from Nyarlathotep, and a big fight on the abandoned death ship. And one PC changed his drive.<br/><br/>So, I railroaded the PCs into player choice. Or something.<br/><br/>Why did I railroad? Because I knew they didn't really care how they got across the Indian Ocean, and they trusted me to give them some cool fights on the way. And Clipper ship!

The way they got it presented was literally a fait accompli--Jeeves (yeah, that one; Post-Modern, remember?) showed up and said "I have a way for you to get to Australia that will be less traceable." So they went for it.<br/><br/>But yeah, had they said "No way," I would have skipped the clipper ship. I think up a lot of scenes that would be cool, in my estimation, for each session, but I drop them if the session progresses in a way that would avoid them. (Sometimes for the best. I had a whole elaborate thing I was going to do involving a headless Norwegian Thompson gunner. That was probably best avoided.) There are only a few things I run as unavoidable set-pieces, and come to think of it most of those have involved an Outer God...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19051/why-did-you-railroad" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19051/why-did-you-railroad" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19051/why-did-you-railroad/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19051%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19051%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
