But yeah, in principle I guess I agree with you on the main points.<br/><br/>Also as I said in the other thread, the reason that Bliss Stage feels "like anime" is that it represents teenagers in a way atypical in western fiction but common in anime. Because this is a fundamental difference between the American and Japanese culture (as opposed to a superficial difference), the end-result feels like anime even when the overt signs are minimized. The reason for this feeling of similarity is that the same process happens in your head when you watch anime: you see the unusual anime viewpoint on teenagers (in this case), and have learned to associate the discrepancy with anime. You'd get a similar effect by taking any other cultural differences and designing consciously towards the anime option.<br/><br/>The question of other methods for achieving anime is a bit too heavy for me at this time of the day. Perhaps tomorrow. My basic answer is, as always, that the ways of achieving something general like this are quite numberless and classifying them would be quite a feat. Game design is such a wondrous beast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183974/#Comment_183974" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T11:46:51+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 11:46AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnyhilate</cite>as opposed to games like BESM, OVA or PTA, which rely exclusively on the group bringing the "anime" part with them to the table?</blockquote>\nGiven the extraordinarily wide range of anime, isn't this a better approach to getting the mixture of elements a particular group wants?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183983/#Comment_183983" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T12:21:08+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 12:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2008 12:27PM by Andy.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Given the extraordinarily wide range of anime, isn't this a better approach to getting the mixture of elements a particular group wants?</blockquote>\nI was thinking this very thing.<br/><br/><b>BUT</b>, I think in this case it's not an unreasonable request to try to think of games that specifically have widgets/rules for stuff that pops up in anime... ANY anime (from Harem to Action to Challenge/Sports/Game/Battle to Whatever)... I thought that that would be a watery watered-down discussion with too many games pushed forward... <br/><br/>...but thinking about it for a minute, there really aren't that many games with widgets/gimmicks/rules to help support something found in anime. So I think a laundry list might be ok.<br/><br/>Thing is, there are some non-"Anime!" games that do very anime things through gimmicks. Give me a few hours and I'll talk -once again- about Hellas and how it has some anime-ish rules bits. Am currently thinking of other mainstream and small press games with rules/gimmicks/widgets for anime-style play without realizing it.<br/><br/>So yeah, be it a Harem Simulation rule or a Battle Anime story structure/rule or a Depressing Loneliness Shut-In rule, I don't think it's too out there to drop some games be it whatever anime they emulate.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184018/#Comment_184018" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T15:30:27+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  3:30PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnyhilate</cite>Come to think of it, DitV is pretty much shonen anime, despite the misleading Mormon gunslingers color.</blockquote>\nWould you be willing to break that out into its own thread? It boggles me. It seems to me that Dogs presents the same question as a lot of shonen stuff, but from a really different perspective. Shonen is about young boys imagining being super-empowered - and how to use power right. Dogs is about adults imagining young boys being super-empowered - and all the horrible ways that might go wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184060/#Comment_184060" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T23:08:15+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 11:08PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Panty Explosion. Its basic framework for play is the social battleground of the Japanese Public School system, which is the setting of like half the anime in existence. And the major element besides the sheer High School Drama is drawn from supernatural horror anime.<br/><br/>The basic framework is supported by a bunch of flavor components like the the Godai Elements as traits, choosing your zodiac sign and blood type, and drawing from the list of Japanese societal archetypes and folklore monsters. Any Anime-style <i>narration</i> must be brought by the players (which is i think what Eero is getting at; his Bliss Stage game probably felt pretty "Western-style" in narration and character personality), but that's true of any game. The scaffolding of Psychic Schoolgirls, Anime style, is firmly in place to build on.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184062/#Comment_184062" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T23:34:10+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 11:34PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, what I meant by our Bliss Stage campaign not being anime-style was simply that nobody, insofar as I noticed, was imagining the events in bright cartoon colors. The characters were not clich\xe9d stereotypes, there was no sexual humour, no cute sidekicks or any of the other things one might expect of adventure anime.<br/><br/>In general, that's pretty much my requirement for me to consider something an "anime game": the game has to reliably lead to the players considering the fiction in terms of anime visuals. Not that Bliss Stage couldn't, but in our case we chose not to go that way. Which is interesting, as I was playing with teenagers who are extremely keen about anime. Actually, now that I think of it, I can easily pinpoint the specific rule that prevented the anime stylings: Ben requests in the game text that the story be set in the home town of the players, which in our case meant such a huge stretch (a sparsely populated area in Eastern Finland is not a place one would look to first when planning mecha war, you know) that all our attention was focused on making that conceit believable. Doing it all with anime color would have been ludicrous.<br/><br/>But anyway, that's Bliss Stage. Looking at the wider question, I guess I'm overall rather lukewarm on the notion of anime game just for the sake of anime color. It's this analytical game design thing, it sort of burns the intense practitioner into a deep hole of interactive sociology, from whence things like game color seem like trivial requirements of conducting a roleplaying game in the first place. I sort of understand in the abstract that there might be an audience clamoring for a specifically anime game, a game which provides them with the superficial qualities of anime, but providing that doesn't seem very interesting: really, making your game <i>seem</i> like anime doesn't require anything more complex than a) some general storytelling skills and b) plenty of familiarity with anime. The real challenge for anybody seeking to create an anime game is to consider whether he can really provide these qualities for a group lacking in them, or is he doomed to just supplement and in general repeat in writing what the reader already knows. This is how I view those generic anime games we've discussed: something like OVA is completely redundant for a group already committed to anime color, and completely useless for a group without the skills to bring the anime qualities into their game. Thus the game is left on the level of superficial decor that mostly works as a sort of rpg/anime comedy. "Hey look, my character can summon objects from thin air, just like in that anime XXX. Kawai!" This sort of game design is doing nothing for the game - the player who can appreciate the vanishing hammer trick in the first place already has all the skills he'd need to utilize the hammer in freeform play. And paying character points for it? A completely dysfunctional hybrid of roleplaying and anime conventions if there was one.<br/><br/>Getting around the challenge of creating an anime game that actually provides useful tools for players already proficient in anime seems to me like it requires operations on the thematic level, like Bliss Stage does. Recognize the issues that an American audience sees in anime, and make a game to highlight those. The anime color will be provided by the players if they want it. Alternatively, really breach that barrier and make an anime game that provides the anime experience in such an overwhelming manner that it manages to communicate the aesthetic even to players who are not familiar with anime. Good luck with that, I say.<br/><br/>So, provided that I'm interested in the issues that a western audience sees in Japanese storytelling, what are those? I already identified the one Bliss Stage uses, which is the different perspective on teenager storytelling. Any others?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184086/#Comment_184086" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T06:42:51+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  6:42AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's usually pretty easy to figure out how people are imagining things if you have enough cross-communication and commentary on the game events. At least I usually notice when the teenagers are in the anime mode, as they start describing the action with references to popular series and drawing (it seems sometimes that all the teenagers around here draw when they play) manga versions of the events on the character sheet backsides. Anybody who's played some PTA or Zombie Cinema (another game that makes heavy use of visual metaphor) tends to start doing this thing where they describe things through the camera lens for added visuals - it's gotten to a level where I can recognize a traditional roleplayer simply because he describes action from the viewpoint of the literary all-knowing narrator, while a "storygamer" will usually play almost any game with the implicit or explicit notion that not everything is described, and what is left unseen is as important as what is shown. When the player tells you that his character's hair is green and that a floating drop of sweat appears above his head, you can be pretty sure that he's visualizing the scene in anime terms.<br/><br/>That last paragraph is interesting. How do you see anime narratives as different from other types of narrative? I'm not saying that they're not different, but it doesn't seem to me like there is much unifying different animes in this regard; one might as well say that something like "television drama" is different from movies. So it is, but there are so many ways of being different that the difference alone doesn't say much.<br/><br/>In practical use PTA does quite well with anime; you're still getting stories in the 3/4-act structure familiar from long-form tv series (this is caused by how the game uses game session length to pace the drama; would need to rework some procedures to get out of the aristotelian structure), but I haven't found that many players mind the difference that much. Usually people are happy when they get to use the superficial trappings they know and get to deal with the themes they like; having it all paced wrong (from anime series point of view) is something most won't even notice. Now that you mention it, though, it'd be <i>wild</i> to have a game that concentrated on that 20-minute, 2-act structure. That structure gives anime a lot of its narrative pacing, what with adventure animes having fights that last three whole episodes and such. I might even hazard that to make your standard tv emulation rpg work for anime, you'd have to find something to occupy the players so the pace would get slow enough to match anime... assuming simulationistic agenda is pretty much the feasible thing at that point, as I can't imagine following the narrative conceits of the form that closely without some sort of motivation. Copying the superficial color, character types, cliches and themes of anime I can see for almost any sort of creative agenda, but if I also have to copy the narrative pacing and details of scene framing, then it starts seeming like a lot of work for little reward, or like anime emulation in the simulationist vein - not very fun unless I'd be doing the emulation for its own sake, to appreciate the form.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that I wouldn't be interested in a game that had sessions that lasted something like an hour a piece, and were dedicated to generating absolutely genre-faithful 20-minute anime scripts. If nothing else, it'd be a fun challenge to design something that manages to make players spend three sessions describing that one fight without going out of their minds. My initial idea would be that at this level one would have to depend on storyboards as a game mechanic - simply unfeasible to expect players to emulate a visual medium at that level of detail without some sort of visualizing tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
