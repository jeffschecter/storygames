<p>One colloquialism I've seen on various fora is using violence to the male sex to reflect some kind of interpersonal friction going on. Such as: "Next person who mentions Exalted gets cock-punched." I think this is funny and probably harmless, but I also feel like it's probably ultimately exclusionary. I mean, when's the last time someone said "Next person who mentions D20 gets breast-thwacked"? Not so much. So I suggest reaching for metaphors of pure, non-sexualized violence if you need, such as: "Next person who mentions Dogs in the Vineyard gets run over with my car." See, isn't that better? But this is probably a minor thing - there's a good chance that no one is offended, but also it's something that may make a community more inclusive. Maybe.</p>
<p>The "Muy Macho" thing: I don't feel the maleness is, itself, the point. What other metaphors work?</p>
<p>I actually feel I've seen lots of good poker play that taps into some of what's going on.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like stakes to be high, and I play as good as I can in order to win. Of course, I do not cheat.</li>
<li>I will do everything to win, and I need you to play as good as you can as well.<br/>
** <em>Note: Good poker players often complain that inexperienced casual players often "mess up" their guesses/calculations by not playing "hard" enough. I can explain this later if needed.</em></li>
<li>You might take all my chips: but by the rules of poker, that's okay. That we're playing poker in the first place means we're both taking each other's chips.<br/>
** <em>Many poker players are upset when they lose their chips, and act like tools. I say they are bad poker players.</em></li>
<li>I'm willing to go all in an any time, and will do so in order to push you out and, hence, get closer to winning. You have to be willing to do the same.</li>
<li>Poker is AWESOME.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any takers?</p>

<p><code>But this is probably a minor thing - there's a good chance that no one is offended, but also it's something that may make a community more inclusive.</code></p>
<p>But ... what if I don't <strong>care</strong> whether the community is welcoming to people around whom I have to watch my words carefully?</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=383&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">What did you come here for</a> thread I said this:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>What I <strong>like</strong> is that there's a vibe here that says we can take the work seriously without having to take ourselves seriously.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If I were asked today I would say the same thing, only twice as forcefully.  So we've got some people who want everyone to consider their words with great seriousness, and all that fol-de-roll, so that they can feel welcome.</p>
<p>Honest question:  Why would I want them here?  I mean, I'm not against it, but I don't see why I should go out of my way to be welcoming to people who are pretty well totally out of synch with what I value about the board.</p>
<p>Maybe if you can explain what's in it for me then I'd pay a little more attention to your recommendations for how I could phrase things differently.</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>If, in the end, this board ends up being mostly Forge people, I'll eventually stop posting here. Because much as I like you guys, if I want to talk with just you, I can do it other places. So, unless we open enough at least enough to let other voices into the community, eventually you'll lose at least one extra voice. Note, this isn't meant as a threat or anything stupid like that. I won't leave because people are 'bad', but I'll get bored if this place is just like the other places. It's just something that I can foresee happening, and since you asked....<br/><br/>Though, for the record, there is also a huge fucking difference between "I don't want to be excluded" and "Don't you dare offend me in any way!" You, my friend, just commited the fallacy of the excluded middle. I'm very much into the first, and very much mocking of the second. I don't think we have to watch every word we say and second guess every statement that we make (I will say "punch you in the dick" until the day I die), but when people bring up specific issues in a reasonable and humurous way, I do not think there is any fault in listening and considering their words. <br/><br/>(Which is why, sorry Dev, I found the fist post in this thread a little silly. I think your heart is in the right place, but I think you're worrying about the wrong rhetorical aspects. If you want to hear more about this ask away, but I may be slow in responding as its something of a draining topic for me.)<br/><br/>Not to mention that one of the things that "we do" is form a community -- and I think we can take that community seriously and still not take ourselves seriously. I know I don't take myself all that seriously, but I do take seriously the issue of why we have such a historical gender and racial imbalance in the hobby and the community.<br/><br/>So, Tony, where do you fall in this if we don't conceive of it in terms of one vs the other and being all super careful vs being anarchists? I know you don't want to have to watch your words, but how much space are you willing to give people who may need some time to get on their feet and find their confidence? You and I can knock heads all day long and have fun about it, but what should we do when talking with people who don't like to play ram?                        </div>

<p>What's in it for you:</p>
<p>(1) You know that some people who come across what you've written aren't accidentally upset by something you're not actually saying. Saying upsetting but true things is one thing, but I don't see the use in upsetting people for things that you're not actually saying.</p>
<p>(2) There are people who could benefit from what you have to say, but get caught up in phrasing. Your words can do more good if they reach more people.</p>
<p>Beyond that: you're a member of this community. If your content is such that it makes other members feel uncomfortable, it screws with their participation in the community, and the value that others would have gotten from their participation.</p>
<p>I hope this doesn't come off as policing you, because I'm not, and I'm never going to force you to rename your writing to something else.</p>

<p>I hope you're just about done editing, Brand, 'cuz I'd like to respond.</p>
<p><code>Though, for the record, there is also a huge fucking difference between "I don't want to be excluded" and "Don't you dare offend me in any way!"</code></p>
<p>I'm sure there is, but it doesn't matter to me.  I'm basically not paying attention to the concerns of <em>either</em> group.</p>
<p>Way I see it is this:  You come into this forum and, unlike pretty much every other forum I know of, you immediately see the way that people are going to behave in their least guarded moments.  We genuinely don't go very long between cock-punch comments, and I think that's an important part of what makes the forum great.</p>
<p>So you see that offensive, insensitive shit being spouted and you figure one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a place where I am welcome, and therefore that shit isn't an attack on me, or</li>
<li>That shit is an attack on me, therefore this isn't a place where I am welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delaying</strong> people's exposure to the offensive, insensitive shit is not going to make this situation better.  There is no "getting on your feet and finding your confidence."  The only thing that a safe zone is going to give people is the chance to feel betrayed later, because they thought the community was one thing and it turns out to be another.</p>
<p>Now if you're talking about making Story Games <em>as a whole</em> less offensive, more politic, less cock-punchy ... then I say bring it on.  I'll <strong>fight</strong> you over that one.  I value our ability to say stupid shit.  There are plenty of other places I can go on the internet to deal with cautious, homogenized, pre-packaged pablum.  I need another such forum like my neighborhood needs another Starbucks.</p>

                            It's amazing how this forum is different things to different people.<br/>
<br/>
I was just commenting the other day about the fact that some people see it as the Forge's off-topic lounge, and other people see it as a shelter for people who hate "the Forge."<br/>
<br/>
It basically comes from any place with a loose mission statement, though.  That's part of the territory.<br/>

                            I have to agree with Tony.  Dammit, I like the childish langauge here.  e.g. cock-punching.  It makes me laugh and cringe all at once when I think of it.  *laugh*<br/><br/>Now Brand, not to call you out of anything, but have you looked at your avatar pic?  With that picture there, you tell me that you obviously don't care if you offend anyone am I right?  Alexander had bouncing boobs as his avatar.  I'm sure someone took offense to it because Larry had to defend him for having that avatar.  (read <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=178&amp;page=1#Item_48" rel="nofollow">here</a>) Sadly though... he's pulled it.  Personally I say, keep the bouncing boobies!  <br/><br/>Now everyone shouldn't think that I am not compassionate of their feelings but dammit, doesn't majority rule?  If out of a few hundred people, only one has a problem, I mean address it obviously but why do the other hundred have to change?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm missing something here.<br/><br/>I too would like to hear Andy's opinion.  Acutally Im wondering if he's going to tell me to stuff it!  *laugh*<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

                            Lisa, <br/><br/>Let me say this again, one more time, as I said before:<code>for the record, there is also a huge fucking difference between "I don't want to be excluded" and "Don't you dare offend me in any way!"</code><br/><br/>You may have noticed that I have a picture of me flipping you all off. You may also notice that I am one of the lead sayers of things like "cock punching" and "fuck you in the ear so you can hear me coming!" I do these things because, while they may be offensive, they're also silly and funny and fun. They, in my view at least, get at the second part -- they aren't excluding people so much as they may simply be offending them. <br/><br/>Now, when someone like Jess comes on and says that she has a problem with a term I'm using, or a way I am addressing things because it doesn't make her offended (or doesn't just do that) it makes her feel EXCLUDED. It makes her feel as though she is in a hostile environment in which the dominant cults of personality are actively hostile to her participation*. That is a different thing than someone saying, "cock punching is offensive!" <br/><br/>It's that second thing that I'm talking about. Not the first. <br/><br/>See, in his orriginal thread Tony had a line that said: "Are there places where it is offensive without meaning to be?"<br/><br/>That's the shit I'm talking about. Not where we mean to be offensive, but where we don't mean to. How we deal with it when people say not "THAT IS OFFENSIVE!" but "Um, when you say that it mutes me and keeps me from talking with you." <br/><br/>Though I find it interesting that much as we asked the question, right there in text, when people have actually come and answered it the result has been statements on one side that the PC thugs should just get over it, and that Tony and I are obviously bad, ignorant, stupid white-male dominators on the other. <br/><br/>It became, somewhere after Jess and before this post, a fight about what should be allowed on the forums because it could be offensive instead of a fight about how we deal with each other when people have honest problems that are marginalizing them from a community they want to be a part of. <br/><br/>I agree with Tony that the first part is fucked up. But that second part? That second part is pretty fucking important. <br/><br/>Look back at the Special Gaming Conversation thread -- remember my first response? "I disagree, but because you've brought it to me openly and honestly I refrain until we can talk about it more?" The one that you thought was well stated? <br/><br/>That's what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>::sigh:: It isn't about what words we use. It isn't about being PC. It most certainly isn't about making the community a mass of .. what was that colorful phrase... "cautious, homogenized, pre-packaged pablum," but it is about making it a community where people can have their voices heard -- both the offensive loud pushy voices, and the softer, quieter, more easily overlooked ones as well. <br/><br/>*Note that Jess didn't actually say that, but just raised a concern that things might head that way if people didn't think about it. She, IMO, did the right thing. She isn't the bad guy in this situation. And, for that matter, neither is Tony -- though I think some people may be starting to paint him towards that corner.                        </div>

                            Lisa, <br/><br/>Sorry if I was snappy. I don't really know why, but I sort of feel like my back is against a wall and I'm starting to get that crazy agressive feeling that I get when I go into rhetorical attack mode. <br/><br/>To be clear, I am not pissed with anyone on the forum right now. I think that, considering what a big issue this is, everyone has done really well. I'm still down with Tony and I'll still beat him at Capes, and I still would play with all you folks. <br/><br/>It's just that this lies so close to RL issues that I've been fighting with for years that I'm afraid my clarity and patience suffers for it.                        </div>

You basically just told a whole bunch of people that you don't value our presence here, because we're "totally out of synch with what I value about the board."

<p>FWIW, I'm sort of regretting the first paragraph of my post there, w.r.t "cock-punching", because people are going to mix things up with this fear that I'm hear to sanitize your language with soap and baby oil. I'm not. I'm not so worried about abstract "offense", but I don't want to be needlessly, uselessly exclusionary. These things are separate, and I'm not here to play PoliteCops(tm).</p>

                            Hey all, gonna go to bed in a sec, but I'm back from Forge Midwest, and although this thread has derailed and flown halfway to Venus, It's still an important thread:
<blockquote><i>from Ben:</i>I was just commenting the other day about the fact that some people see it as the Forge's off-topic lounge, and other people see it as a shelter for people who hate "the Forge."<br/><br/>It basically comes from any place with a loose mission statement, though. That's part of the territory.</blockquote>
I think that, luckily, most of the folks who just couldn't get over the Forge Hate have left, either for legitamite reasons or fantasy reasons. Which is good. The rest of the folks here seem to be able to talk to each other, discuss and contradict as not only adults, but peers.<br/><br/>And on the second point, while I took away the "Test Community" verbage, we're still there. A test community, feeling out the borders.  We recently just had like 6 people jump on board this weekend, and we're pushing about 300 registered folks (I may shortly be putting stop-gaps in while we figure shit out), and the nature of the place is still loose and changing.<br/><br/>So for now, I'm moderating as if I've got this half-written RPG that I'm working on: I don't know explicitly how the final rules will work (and I probably never will), but I know how I want the game to be played. And that's what I'm using to implement my vision and moderation.<br/><br/>Anyway, reviewing the above, I'm pretty much 100% in agreement in spirit with Brand's comments. And at the same time, I'm loving what Tony has to say.  It's such a grey, fluid area, but here's my thoughts. And review carefully, because they are, like human discourse, contradictory and rely on the situation in question:<br/><br/>*I want people to say what they want without holding themselves back.<br/>*I want people to respect the other people on this board.<br/>*In fact, I want people to pretend, as hard as they fucking can, that <b>tomorrow</b> there's a chance that you'll see the person you're talking to in person. You'll meet them and shake their hand. So post, reply, disscuss and argue as if these people are... not your friends, cause that's just unrealistic to the point of naieve... but that they are human beings that you could one day soon actually meet and talk to in person. &lt;--- This is probably the one thing that, if considered by everyone here above all else, will keep this place a community which is bearable for the majority of the people without anyone having to step lightly.<br/>*And rolling with that, I want people to put a good time-and-a-half into trying to understand the other person. And to try hard to forgive them if they cross some line.<br/>*I want people to, if they have problems with the behavior of someone, to take it to them (privately), rather than asking me (the authority) to get involved. Again, with the above in mind.<br/><br/>So, for Tony, and Brand, and everyone, I want you all to keep talking the way you talk, doing what you do, and the like. If someone wants you to think about the words they use, and tell you so (and not tell ME to tell you, because I won't do that), imagine that it's someone you've met, or will meet, who is making that request. Roll the thought around in your head. Think about it for a bit. If it's hard to get in the mindset, pretend that the request came from an older brother or sister*. You don't have to capitulate, but you better give it at least a good 10 seconds of thought, and not just to bounce back with a clever reflection, block, or retort.<br/><br/>As for people TELLING others what to say or not say (which hasn't happened, but appears to be a legitimate concern of Tony's), that's simply not going to fly. I won't moderate that behavior, most likely (ie by telling them to shut up, or that "I make the rules", etc), but it'll be like a clear sign that the person who wants to enforce behavior is either mistaken as to what goes on here, or they already have one proverbial foot out the door anyway. In that case, I'll help with a push.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

And that same desire informs my position on the general take on this thread: I come here Punk Rock, and expect the rest of you to be Punk Rock, too.  That means I respect all of you, because your here, and you're here with pure motives of love for the games, and in a way that makes you like an extended family to me.  And even if I think you're uncouth, so long as you're not being pointlessly disruptive, I want to be here, and I want to hear what you're saying, even, and especially if what you're saying is<br/>
<br/>
bq. judson, you are a fucking idiot and that idea is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Here's why:<br/>
<br/>
Because at least there's a conversation there.  And I think that's a conversation that's going to lead to me refining my ideas.  Maybe not changing my mind, but my position will certainly be less fuzzy afterwards.  And I'll still like you after the fact.                        </div>

Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever actually read the Forge rules?<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what it means when a thread is closed there?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't mean "the discussion is over."  It means "go start a new thread."<br/>
<br/>
I really fail to understand why so many people have trouble understanding this.  I had a lot of bumps when I started at the Forge, but that always seemed painfully apparent.<br/>

                            Andy: if "this road here" means this thread, let me know and I'll shut up.<br/><br/>I just want to say one thing:<br/><br/>I'm a woman, and I'm brand-new to this community, and I was definitely intimidated by the Forge to the point where I've never made a single post - but as you can all tell, I'm posting here pretty damn freely, and I feel quite welcome, particularly thanks to the efforts of a couple of members to make sure that I know that my voice is valued and heard. <br/><br/>Maybe instead of thinking about this as a subtractive effort ("What can't we say anymore?  That sucks!"), we can start to think about it as an additive one.  How can we reach out to members who are more tentative members of the community?  How can we create language about gaming that's as strongly feminine as "Muy Macho" is masculine?  (I am currently pondering a long rant in which I compare a good system to my bra, which is an analogy that works stunningly well.)  How can we show appreciation for people, to counteract some of the head-butting that goes on here?<br/><br/>I hope that's a less controversial way to look at the problem, and with any luck maybe it will be a constructive one too.                        </div>
