The campaign has been an exercise in experimentation and technique training, with new rules and methods being tried out every session (the most successful probably being the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3383&amp;page=1#Item_33" rel="nofollow">Impro-inspired resolution cards</a>).<br/><br/>The final session went like this:<br/><br/>1. Everyone was instructed to read all the session writeups and think about what plot threads they wanted to see finished.<br/>2. We gathered in a closed room and listened to music while I guided the group into a light trance.<br/>3. We started writing down questions to be answered - "What happens between James Blue and the nurse, in the end?" "How does the Biomorph Uprising resolve?" <br/>4. Taking turns, each player picked up a question and requested a scene. And here's the Most Important Bit:<br/><br/><i>Players were free to decide on method, system, framing, participants - <b>everything </b></i>when setting a scene. <br/><br/>One scene was started like this: "Okay, I want to know whether Everett and Mrs. Ashton get puppies. I play Mrs. Ashton, Morten plays his character Everett. Matthijs, you're the GM - and this should be set up like an old school dungeon crawl". Another scene: "Harold is returning from the Edge Zones, but different parts of him are arguing about what he wants. You and you and you are different parts; roll dice to resolve these internal conflicts, and see what he ends up doing". <br/><br/>We spent the entire evening using different techniques, some of which were way old, others that had been designed specifically for this campaign. And I realized I'd achieved the holy grail of my personal quest (see the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3144&amp;page=1#Item_27" rel="nofollow">Hippie Method Manifesto</a>): We were able to use any and all rules, mixing and matching, to achieve great play. <br/><br/>The great thing about this is that it arose naturally. It didn't feel forced at all. The first session of PTA I ran with this group felt forced, and there was a lot of debate; other systems have also been discussed, some rejected, some accepted. Along the way, weird new ideas became the norm, and having seen that previous weird ideas actually worked, we got more and more confident about bringing in more. By now, the group is so used to being open to new impressions and ideas, and the players' skills are so diverse and highly developed that we can pick up new things as we go and incorporate them as part of the whole experience. I'm way impressed with us <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>The episode ended with an epilogue for each character. This was completely controlled by that character's player, and some very unexpected things happened - one of the players described his character living in a happy marriage, with lots of kids, but being brain damaged and bound to a wheelchair. <br/><br/>Now I don't know what to do for our next campaign. I hope, and believe, there will be one, but I'm waiting for the vibe to be right.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Njordi" title="Njordi"><img alt="Njordi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Njordi">Njordi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105840/#Comment_105840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T01:54:45+00:00" title="November  1, 2007  1:54AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm...

Njordi, do you remember the arguments about plot ownership when we first started using PTA? And how hard it was to actually grasp, and enjoy, the freedom/power of scene requests? How we sometimes fumbled, and sometimes got brilliant scenes? Now, we're used to these things. We've internalized them, and they work for us when we want them to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105989/#Comment_105989" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T10:52:12+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 10:52AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, weird.

The feeling of constructively ending a collective creation. <br/><br/><b>What happened in the game, by the rules</b><br/>Do you mean a complete summary, or my favorite part?<br/><br/><b>What happened in the story</b><br/>Since this was the final session of a campaign, and a very chaotic one, it's hard to sum this up in a forum post. But here's a quick summing-up of events we collaborated on. I didn't write down the character epilogues; I was meaning to let the players write about those.<br/>- The dog-like Everett Riber Gylden (PC) and his lover Mrs. Ashton had puppies, which she'd hidden in the depths of the sub-city catacombs.<br/>- Professor Harold Ebenhardt (PC) returned from the Edge Zones after a long internal debate, riding a goat with human horns (and there was much debate about what "human horns" are). This was the fulfilment of a vision Everett had seen on a Rorschach Giraffe earlier in the campaign.<br/>- The Machine God finally visited Astra M. Hilmar (PC), and didn't look or act anything like what we'd expected. Smoother, more human... however, in a discussion on styles of leadership it was obvious that he was machine-like in his rationality. <br/>- In a conflict scene, three motivations were colliding: The living dreams that were haunting the city wanted to enter the Scissor Men (minions of the Machine God). Some sentientities wanted to steal the Cast (molten dreams to be cast into forms). And the Machine God wanted to streamline the casting process. Players controlled (among other things) a fly and a pile of sawdust; the fly distracted the Scissor Men, the pile was set on fire, and the place exploded, leaking a molten stream of Cast.<br/>- We heard from the six first Biomorphs that were hit by shards of an earlier exploding Dream Cast, giving them dreams for the first time. A wonderful scene, based solely on NPCs we'd never seen before and how they handled their new existences.<br/>- The Great Zephyro (PC) rallied the Biomorphs outside the Moon Tower - but their creator, Professor Polli Volli, spoke against him. Strangling him didn't help; he had copies. The spider goddess Nindra spoke through James Blue (PC) about being the Mother of All. James Blue cut the strand of web that connected her to the tower, leaving her falling towards the river Akron.<br/>- Another scene of NPCs, all children from the orphanage. We heard how their lives were now - that is, years after the end of the campaign. <br/>- James Blue managed to put an explosive device into the Machine God's mouth - but since they were mentally connected through James Blue's hat, JB was badly affected by the explosion.<br/>- Astra met the Sour-bellied Guard, a recurring NPC. They went to the roof of the Moon Tower, and broke a ring recovered from Adele Ringblomst, keeping one piece each. The full moon went out.<br/>- Cathy and Harold, who have a very complex relationship (she is perhaps his dead wife; he might have raped her brutally in an alternate reality; possibly she's just his brother's maid who served him at a party), met at Cafe Parasol. She wanted to make it work; he said it couldn't.<br/>- A bunch of old people babbled unintelligibly about where Zephyro's pigeons might have come from.<br/>- Astra and Zephyro rebuild the smithy/castery and start casting dreams. Astra's mother's ghost appears to James Blue, who is now mute. "What about love?", she asks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Njordi" title="Njordi"><img alt="Njordi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Njordi">Njordi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106427/#Comment_106427" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-03T14:04:26+00:00" title="November  3, 2007  2:04PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2007 6:35PM by Njordi.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Matthijs<br/>\nBut at the same time, it didn't feel like we weretrying.

And not in the sense that it was difficult to understand, but more like "can you DO that?", "will it be any fun?", "can we make an engaging, coherent story like this?"<br/>\nAnd the answers, of course turned out to be "HELL YEAH!!!"<br/>\nI do know of course that we were using a lot of different techniques, but as you say, it didn't feel forced. <br/>\nIn the end I think it has a lot to do with trust. The players (and gm) know, trust and love each other. And when the gm says "we're gonna try out this new, crazy, hippie technique!" We all trust the crazy bozo to lead us to great, moving and memorable gaming experiences with those techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoved the short and brutal sumup btw, it sounds like a crazy fun gaming session ;)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106738/#Comment_106738" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T10:32:10+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 10:32AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trust is essential.
