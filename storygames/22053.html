Some people consider the very first "story game" RPG (at least consciously so) to be Ron Edwards's <i>Sorcerer</i>. <br/><br/>However, the game is notoriously "difficult" for some people, who tend to struggle with it before "getting it". Nevertheless, those people often turn into <i>Sorcerer's</i> greatest fans. About a decade ago, Jesse Burneko wrote a series of threads which serve as a guide to understanding and playing that game, in great depth:\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/5957/practice-sorcerer-all-in-one-place" rel="nofollow">[Practice: Sorcerer] All in one place</a></b></blockquote>\nUnfortunately, the links collected in the first post (above) got mangled when Story Games updated its software.

If you follow the links, you'll find a variety of discussions, house rules, and experiments:\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21581/2097-d-d-house-rules-as-per-pauls-request" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D House Rules [2097e]</a></b></blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> has his own version and style of running D&amp;D5e, with, among other things, an experience system inspired, in part, by <i>Dungeon World</i>:\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21871/5e-the-deliverator-way" rel="nofollow">5e the Deliverator Way</a></b></blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> posted in great detail about his own "City of Brass/Mirrorrim" campaign, which involves a number of really unusual choices, from the particulars of the setting, to the detailed play agenda, to new races and rules modifications. Deals with social issues (like poverty!) in an urban setting in a most unusual way, and you can see the evolution and development from a novel concept for a con game to a megadungeon campaign in this series of threads:\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20985/epic-amazing-thing-d-d-5e-city-of-brass" rel="nofollow">Epic, Amazing Thing: D&amp;D 5e City of Brass</a></b></blockquote>\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21390/adam-drays-city-of-brass-mirrorrim" rel="nofollow">Adam Dray's City of Brass/Mirrorrim</a></b></blockquote>\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21174/shameless-plug-mirrorrim-players-guide-free-preview-5e" rel="nofollow">Mirrorrim: Player's Guide, Free Preview 5e</a></b></blockquote>\nThere have been a number of threads dealing with how to run 4th Edition, as well.

His thoughts have spawned a number of discussions on the nature of "challenge-based adventure" play. You can see how that all got started here:\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14363/lets-ask-eero-about-primitive-d-d" rel="nofollow">Let's ask Eero about Primitive D&amp;D</a></b></blockquote>\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19234/writing-up-eeros-primordial-d-d" rel="nofollow">Writing up Eero's Primordial D&amp;D</a></b></blockquote>\nWe have also discussed D&amp;D as a larger phenomenon, with particular attention to the online game/show <i>Critical Role</i> - a controversial but very interesting discussion, as I struggle with the idea of a new following for this classic game inspired by watching other people play online:\n<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21370/critical-role-and-the-rise-of-d-d" rel="nofollow">Critical Role and the Rise of D&amp;D</a></b></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483958/#Comment_483958" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T21:01:31+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  9:01PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Other games occasionally get a thorough treatment, as well.
