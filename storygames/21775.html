The larger indie gaming populous is mostly made up of post-Forgites who don\u2019t associate the term with the definition Clinton R. Nixon initially intended when he coined the term or that Andy named his site after. The term is considered more specific now then just RPGs + Forgite games, which was created simply because people got sick of arguing over whether My Life with Master was an RPG. It doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to most of the \u201cnext generation\u201d of gamers who are actually working in this sub genre of indie games currently. They aren\u2019t part of the Forgite \u201cdiaspora\u201d for the most part, and the term is rather more precise to them. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476257/#Comment_476257" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-21T18:23:36+00:00" title="August 21, 2018  6:23PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2018 6:56PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An example of this disconnect between the \u201cgenerations\u201d was illustrated when Ron Edwards started to work on four of these \u201cstory games\u201d for his consulting work (one of which was my game, House of Spiders). When all four of us discribed our games as \u201cstory games,\u201d Ron interpreted it in the older Forgite/Story Games Forums senses and hated it because of its association with making Forgite games distinct from other RPGs in the minds of some and how some looked upon the term as having elitist elements. Ron was not using the term as it is used now by post-Forgites who are the majority of indie RPG players and the majority of those playing and designing games that fit within this current definition of \u201cstory games.\u201d <br/><br/>I believe the definition that this \u201cgeneration\u201d is working with is very close to the following:<br/><br/>The primary purpose of play is to create a good story in which players work from the perspective of an author or a director. The story rather than inhabiting the subjective viewpoint of a single primary character is the goal of the game, both in the gameplay and in the design. This is not in some watered down sense\u2014in a way that any role playing game could be defined as trying to create a good story\u2014the telling of a good story is what the game is about, everything is aimed at this goal, and the shift in perspective to the directorial, authorial role is central to this. Rather than inhabiting your character or advocating for them, they are to be sacrificed happy if necessary, they are a tool to help create what is good and dramatically compelling for the overall story. <br/><br/>This current, narrower definition of Story Game is very similar to the Dramitist style of gameplay as defined in the Threefold model which values how well the in-game drama creates a satisfying storyline. It is the end result of the story which is important and these games are designed with that purpose in mind.  <br/><br/>I think that for the post-Forgite, who doesn\u2019t carry all the historical baggage that others do, Story Game can be a useful and more precise term than it may seem. Of course, there could probably be a better term\u2014I personally like drama game\u2014which doesn\u2019t have the historical baggage and the spectrum of interpretations, but for designers like myself and other post-Forge designers working in this space, this is how the term is being used and what is primarily meant by it. It is a term with a history whose definition has shifted and been repurposed for better or worse. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476261/#Comment_476261" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-21T18:56:18+00:00" title="August 21, 2018  6:56PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2018 6:57PM by Kenny_J.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sort of disagreement is not unique to table top game design.

The point as a player is to interact with a setting as your character. Settings represent entire worlds with all their inherent possibilities. Like in life the choice are effectively unlimited. Sure you can as your character flap your arms and fly in a historical medieval setting. But there are still dozens if not hundreds of things to explore and do. <br/><br/>The challenge is trying to accomplish whatever your goals within what your character is can do or capable of learning. A good tabletop referee will do what needed to make a player feels like they are inhabiting the setting as their character.

There is a spectrum between all of these and more. Starting with and before Arneson's Blackmoor the default is for campaigns to be hybrids with a little bit of that and little bit of this. While my opinion is that a firm definition can be drawn, a specific game will always be a hybrid incorporating different elements that the author wants to focus on.<br/><br/>It has been my observation for the past 4 decades that a tabletop roleplaying game focuses on players interacting with a setting as their character with their actions adjudicated by a human referee. While wargames focus on the achievement of victory (competitive) or victory conditions (cooperative). And finally storygames are focused on using the mechanics of a game to collaboratively build a story or narrative as a group. <br/><br/>Because it focus, one can't just look at the mechanics. You have to look at the whole package to get a sense of what the author is trying to focus on. And it that focus that makes a given work useful for specific form of gaming. <br/><br/>Even then because of their hybrid nature, elements of a work may be useful for the other types of games.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476270/#Comment_476270" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-21T22:59:47+00:00" title="August 21, 2018 10:59PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2018 11:04PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everything you wrote, robertsconley.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476271/#Comment_476271" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-21T23:16:18+00:00" title="August 21, 2018 11:16PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The primary purpose of play is to create a good story in which players work from the perspective of an author or a director.

These games definitely do not, however, fulfill your suggested condition of having the players work from an authorial perspective - whether AW or Fate or Heroquest or whatever, they are all about character players playing their characters.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476273/#Comment_476273" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T00:31:01+00:00" title="August 22, 2018 12:31AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd definitely go with "broad and vague", Brendan.<br/><br/>When I hear "story game", I don't know what the game is going to be; mostly, I know it probably <i>won't</i> be focused on combat or survival challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476274/#Comment_476274" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T00:37:29+00:00" title="August 22, 2018 12:37AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, names come with a lot of baggage and debate.

That\u2019s why I usually use the term Collaborative GMless Story Games to discribe them if the narrative roles players play are similarly, like in Fiasco for example.

In the games I am talking about you\u2019re playing them from an authorial  perspective. You can be empathetic, and you should be to a point, it\u2019s part of the fun...but, in Fiasco, for example, you should also be fine with your character\u2019s head getting blown off, if it makes the story cool. That is, if your going to play it the way it\u2019s written. <br/><br/>I agree that there is nothing wrong with being into your character in these types of games, but if you trash the story because that\u2019s your main concern that isn\u2019t exactly the best way to play: <b>Fiasco</b> or  <b>Archipelago</b> or <b>Fall of Magic</b> type games IMO.

My other friend defined it as "Writing of a certain caliber."<br/><br/>I asked another writer from my community I know and she defined it as "Literary is the focus on the craft of writing", in other words the artful use of language rather than the subject matter. (again I'm paraphrasing a bit).<br/><br/>I contrast this a with the person I met doing NaNoWriMo who said her genre was "fat chick lit" (her words). I never got a thorough definition of it.<br/><br/>I think we even had a post on story games a while back about gaming that blurred the line between gaming and Literary works.<br/><br/>What IS literary writing? Wikipedia says "Literary fiction is a term used to distinguish certain fictional works that possess commonly held qualities to readers outside genre fiction. Literary fiction has been defined as any fiction that attempts to engage with one or more truths or questions, hence relevant to a broad scope of humanity as a form of expression." (Some of the definition of story games border on something similar I think)<br/><br/><b>My point is</b>, someone may argue until they are blue in the face that a term means "x," but only history is the judge, or maybe widely published historical authors are the judge? <br/><br/>Who's writing the the next semi-best seller on 'story games' right now i wonder? Maybe the future is streaming documentaries on services like netflix. I can't wait to watch "Story Games, the movie." Maybe after watching <i>that</i> I'll form a impactful opinion on the term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hyades" title="hyades"><img alt="hyades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nC00J8GI62UXP.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hyades">hyades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476334/#Comment_476334" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T06:07:32+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  6:07AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I\u2019m not talking about all GMless games obviously.

He says it in a different way, which might make it clearer, whether you agree with him or not. <br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/</a><br/><br/>Ben designed <b>Microscope</b>, <b>Kingdom</b> and <b>Follow</b> and (along with Jason) is arguably the most accomplished designer in this space. He sees a distinction between these types of games and the way they are played and there\u2019s good reason to trust his conclusion. He has played them hundreds of times, and played them exclusively for 8 years as the founder of Story Games Seattle. He has probably played these games more times than almost anyone. I\u2019ve also played these games once or twice a week for about 2 1/2 years\u2014usually a different game every session\u2014and studied their designs. So the distinction is based on praxis rather than simply being theoretical. <br/><br/>It doesn\u2019t really matter if one calls these types of games \u201cstory games\u201d or something else. The point I\u2019m making is that there are certain things  that make Collaborative GMless \u201cStory Games\u201d that are played from a directorial, authorial perspective different from other RPGs. In these games all of the players act as authors and  actors all at once, and one is not playing a character strategically to overcome obstacles and referring to the character\u2019s fictional abilities  to do so; but, instead, playing them to contribute to a shared story in order to entertain the audience (the players) by making that story dramatic, compelling, and so forth. <br/><br/>If you try to play these games the way you\u2019d play a typical RPG it\u2019s not going to work out well and you\u2019re not going to enjoy yourself. There is a shift of perspective that\u2019s necessary and a shift in what one is trying to accomplish and what is considered a \u201cgood time.\u201d I think the distinction between these types of games and other RPGs is a useful one. That doesn\u2019t mean that many games don\u2019t have features of both or that there isn\u2019t a spectrum. <br/><br/>If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a useful distinction, fair enough; you may have good reasons for believing so. I\u2019m offering my perspective and I\u2019m more than willing to change it. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476347/#Comment_476347" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T19:47:15+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  7:47PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2018 7:50PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>I think you're absolutely right that those kinds of games fit in a certain design space and are "birds of the same feather".<br/><br/>People may quibble with details, though, because you can have "GMless Games" where the story is not the key thing (those are rare, in my experience, but perhaps something like <i>Once Upon a Time</i> fits the bill), and you can have "traditionally GMed" games where either the game's design or the play culture around it means that we  "[play] them to contribute to a shared story in order to entertain the audience (the players) by making that story dramatic, compelling, and so forth". <br/><br/>For example, many people play games like <i>Paranoia</i> and <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> this way. Some people play PbtA games this way, too, and many people play convention games in this way, regardless of the rules.<br/><br/>In many circles, playing <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> as an "adventure game" a la D&amp;D would be a serious faux pas, and ruin people's evening. Does that make it a story game? <br/><br/>Speaking for myself, I find that, ultimately, debating the label takes more time and energy than just describing the games themselves. I have no problem with anyone using the term "story games" however they like, so long as they are willing to define the term and use it consistently, however. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>For me?<br/><br/>I'd prefer to take the 5 seconds to type something like, "hey, let's play this game - it's GMless, collaborative, plays out in one session, and has very simple rules" than to attempt a controversial definition of "story game" and knock my head against the wall when people object because it seems to exclude their favourite game.<br/><br/>It also allows me to use the term "story game" to label all forms of creative entertainment where we tell a story together. (So, for me, "roleplaying games" and "storytelling games" are subsets of "story games".) I like that, because it frees me up to think about games and design in a more open-minded way. I might end up designing something far more interesting than I would otherwise, try games I might not otherwise consider, and connect to more people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476352/#Comment_476352" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-23T20:28:41+00:00" title="August 23, 2018  8:28PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2018 4:37AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Jeff,<br/>People may quibble with details, though, because you can have "GMless Games" where the story is not the key thing (those are rare, in my experience, but perhaps something like <i>Once Upon a Time</i> fits the bill), and you can have "traditionally GMed" games where either the game's design or the play culture around it means that we "[play] them to contribute to a shared story in order to entertain the audience (the players) by making that story dramatic, compelling, and so forth". </p></div></blockquote>\nYes, like <b>FateLess</b>, which is GMless, wouldn\u2019t fit because it has stats and players playing strategically to overcome obstacles, so it wouldn\u2019t be in the category.

I know that it's also the name of a historical rpg system, but I don't really mind that. Although I don't find the distinction very important myself, I can see how Jeff's favourite type of story game is defined in a pretty clear way, so why not give the thing a name. Like with Dogma movies or Jeepform games, it's useful if you have a label to put on some things to emphasize certain similarities between them.<br/><br/>I'm less fond of taking the term "story game" and starting to parade around saying stuff about how everything from Fate to Apocalypse World "aren't real story games because they prioritize character fidelity over the concern of composing a story" and so on. That seems like a recipe for endless complaints from people who have adopted the term and are comfortable identifying as "story gamers" - seems like a jerk move to specifically take an established word and insist on defining that to only apply to your own pet projects. Kinda similar to how people sometimes like to insist on some game not being a real roleplaying game because it lacks X or Y feature that they think is central.<br/><br/>It is probably better when inventing new labels to choose words that do not seem like a naked cultural power-grab. In that regard "storytelling game" is hardly ideal, as it is, as I remarked, already in use. Just like readapting "story game" to mean what you like is rude towards other people using the term, Whitewolf gamers would be rightfully annoyed by the overlapping terms.<br/><br/>So I guess in the end Jeff is stuck inventing something else. "Story weaving" is passable, but I'd go further afield myself if I'd have to think up something that needs explaining anyway. There's more than enough story-this and story-that in the field already.<br/><br/>(I'm tempted to suggest "conch-passing", but that's just mean. Bad snark, don't be so snarky.)<br/><br/>"Tale-weaving game" would at least get rid of the literal word "story". "Role-less story game" sounds clumsy but would be very accurate...<br/><br/>How about "roless game", abbreviated RLG? Sounds fun to me. A bit like a trademark, perhaps.<br/><br/>It's essentially a question similar to that faced by larpers - what to call this emerging subcategory of roleplaying. "Live Action Roleplaying" isn't the cleverest name ever, but it's the one that stuck. Maybe "story game" ends up getting refined similarly over time until it really does get accepted as ruling out literal role-playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hyades" title="hyades"><img alt="hyades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nC00J8GI62UXP.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hyades">hyades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476356/#Comment_476356" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T00:29:32+00:00" title="August 24, 2018 12:29AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a useful distinction, fair enough; you may have good reasons for believing so.

Even in Fiasco creative authority isn't really the point as opposed to operating in a dramatic framework set up before play.

Polaris definitely doesn\u2019t have a GM though, and has other disqualifiing elements. Not sure if the Pool would count either, because you have to roll to overcome an obstacle, and you can attach a bonus to traits, so your character\u2019s fictional abilities effect what they can do. I haven\u2019t read Primetime Adventures in a while, and it slipped my mind, but I think it is the perfect example (unless I\u2019m forgetting something about it) of a GMed game that fits this category.<br/><br/>I think the main disqualifier for a lot of GMed games is that the character\u2019s have fictional abilities in them that effect what the characters can do in the fiction. There\u2019s probably a bunch of GMed games that qualify, but for some reason I\u2019m not coming up with them right now.

My bad! You're quite right that it's GMless.<br/><br/>However, consider for a moment a version of <i>Polaris</i> with identical rules and a GM. Now it fits the bill, and would be quite playable - you just have that player always taking on the role of the Mistaken instead one of the others at the table, and there's no need to change any other rules. (For another example, Eero discusses the distinctions between <i>Dust Devils</i> - another game which might fit this bill - and <i>Tales of Entropy</i> and concludes that the GMed/GMless aspect of the games is a nearly cosmetic difference <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/476354/#Comment_476354" rel="nofollow">OVER HERE</a>. And that reminds me that <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, also discussed there, is in the same category.)<br/><br/>The Occupation in <i>Dog Eat Dog</i> is very intentionally written as a commentary on GMing in traditional games, for what it's worth. So that's a pretty strong argument to consider it a "GMed" game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why you think <i>The Pool</i> doesn't count. You don't roll to "overcome an obstacle", generally, but to settle conflicts of interest, and the rules could be read so as to include conflicts of interest <i>between the players</i>. (I don't favour that reading, but it's a very possible one.) Traits (or even the fictional considerations of your characters) don't limit what you can do in the game at all. Traits can be things like "The Taste of Wine" (from an actual game I played) or "The Deft Hand of Fate".<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20897/the-pool-rpg-questions" rel="nofollow">(Our earlier discussion about it might be helpful to review here.)</a><br/><br/>There were dozens, maybe hundreds of games being written at the Forge which included overt conflict resolution and "stake setting", similar to <i>The Pool</i> or <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, and if <i>Primetime Adventures</i> fits the bill, then pretty much all of them should, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476363/#Comment_476363" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T08:00:50+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  8:00AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2018 2:59PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, <br/><br/>As long as characters in the game don\u2019t have stats, or aspects, or keys, or other abilities or traits that can effect the game/narrative in some mechanical way, and the players play from an authorial perspective, the game would qualify.<br/><br/>The basic point is that characters in these games shouldn\u2019t have stats or anything like them. Players should be free to have their characters do whatever works best in the story and any rules limiting what characters can do should be there because they are designed to help to create the type of story the game is trying to tell, rather than to see whether or not a character can or can\u2019t do something based on one of their fictional attributes. <br/><br/>I\u2019m sure most of the games you mentioned above would qualify. Tales of Entropy seems like the type of game that would fit in this space. I can\u2019t remember Polaris completely\u2014how Aspects, Fire and Ice, and rolling dice work\u2014but I know the striped down Story Games Seattle hack qualifies. I\u2019ll never read The Mountain Witch but it\u2019s a game I\u2019ve been wanting to crack open. <br/><br/>The reason the Pool wouldn\u2019t qualify is because characters have traits that can influence what happens in the narrative. Take the following for example:<br/><br/><b>Damart is in an ancient library. I want him to find a piece of knowledge that will help him on his quest, so I ask for a roll based on the Trait \u201csearching for the means to bring his love from the dead +1\u201d. The GM hands me 1 GM die (for my +1 Trait) and decides to give me 2 more to roll as well (he can give me an extra 1-3, remember).</b><br/><br/>Anyway, I better get to sleep.

Isn't that just a detail of mechanical expression?<br/><br/>For instance, we could play The Pool just as easily without Traits. (That +1 die makes practically no difference when you might typically be rolling 7-10 dice anyway. And I believe it's a valid character creation option not to buy any Traits when you make your character, as well.)<br/><br/>Does that somehow change what it feels like to play sufficiently to place the game in an entirely different category, a meaningfully different experience?<br/><br/>Having the trait "searching for the means to..." doesn't constrain the character in any way that simply establishing in the fiction that this is something the character is looking doesn't already do.<br/><br/>Or what if we play The Pool, but agree to only write abstract Traits?<br/><br/>I don't really understand why this is such an important distinction.<br/><br/>The functional design feature I consider important is that we have mechanics which allow us to frame various conflicts or points of uncertainty as dice-worthy (as opposed to rules which simulate game world physics or causality) and that their odds are fundamentally negotiated by the players (as opposed to being based on a module, game world physics, a required level of challenge, or some other authority).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476365/#Comment_476365" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T13:12:48+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  1:12PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I wouldn't mind calling joint storytelling games "storytelling games" myself.</p></div></blockquote>That's what I do with non-gamers.

Each individual person in Finland (and on Earth, probably) either doesn't need to know about the minutiae of the hobby, or are quite happy being ignorant of everything outside their own little corner, or are well aware of the different varieties even without them having a consistent taxonomical scheme. Because I don't personally advocate for a hobby split, it's not really in my best interest to try to narrow down the meaning of the best-known term, "roleplaying" - while it's not very transparently descriptive of the majority of the games meant by the word, it's still clearly the established name for the hobby as a whole.<br/><br/>If there existed a storytelling game (the sort Jeff's specifically enthusiastic about) with success on the scale of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>, it would probably be more sustainable to insist on categorizing subtypes of roleplaying game.

I'm not sure why you don't think that's relevant here.<br/><br/>For instance, in many Forgite story games, characters get ratings for their relationships with other characters. In Dogs in the Vineyard, you can create traits and relationships and assign them ratings which correspond to how important you, the player, want them to be in the story, entirely separate from the "character's fictional ability".<br/><br/>In The Pool, we could do this, too. <br/><br/>We create two characters who have these traits:<br/><br/>Alpha is the world's greatest swordmaster. She has the Trait "Legendary Duelist - 1 die".<br/><br/>Charlie, on the other hand, is a drunkard who has the Trait "When I'm drunk, I can barely stand on my own two feet - 4 dice."<br/><br/>Now, in our story, Charlie challenges Alpha to a duel, but he's terrified, so he gets hopelessly drunk first.<br/><br/>Hopefully you can see that Charlie is far more likely to win, and that's something we've deliberately set up, as players. It's deliberate story manipulation, not simulationist logic from the character's perspective.<br/><br/>I think that to interpret Ben's definition in a fashion which disqualifies such games is missing the point. (And most traditional gamers would intuitively classify this kind of thing as a "story game" device, so we're working against popular conception, as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476376/#Comment_476376" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T16:45:50+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  4:45PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2018 5:41PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476379/#Comment_476379" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T16:56:55+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  4:56PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, where does that leave us? If you read Ben's article, you'll see that what he's really talking about is a continuum, not a sharp dividing line. Furthermore, the true distinction he keeps talking about is really one of creative agenda; sure, the rules are a major player in that, but what we decide to do with them at the actual table is far more important.<br/><br/>This is why it makes sense, to me, to talk about traditionally familiar "story game" techniques (what we do at the table) and design features, so we can say, for instance, "Hey, this game has some simulationist mechanics but also a way to indicate dramatic focus for characters (e.g. The Riddle of Steel), but we've decided to play it for maximum dramatic impact. My character was a badass swordsman, and I intentionally played him as a tragic anti-hero, sacrificing his life for a doomed cause. It made for a great story!"<br/><br/>To draw strict lines which would reliably categorize that game into "story game" or not... seems like a fool's errand to me.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476386/#Comment_476386" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T17:41:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  5:41PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "role-playing game" is a solid name for the thing where you play via your character.<br/><br/>I think "story-telling game" is a solid name for the thing where you play by narrating what happens in the fiction.<br/><br/>I think it's only the class of games where <i>you do a substantial amount of both</i> that have any reason to fall into the pit of niche jargon/disagreement.

As David suggests, this is great with non-gamers.<br/><br/>"Roleplaying games" are usually a subset of those, where you get to play characters while the game is happening. (I say "usually" because there are some roleplaying games which aren't story games - some roleplaying exercises, some LARPs, some improv theatre, perhaps.)<br/><br/>"Storytelling games" are also a subset - games where we make stuff up together to tell a story.<br/><br/>There's some overlap, sometimes, but those terms feel pretty clear to me.<br/><br/>With people who I feel confident use the term "story game" in a more limited but consistent way (like Jeff), I don't mind using it like that - in conversations with them - but I don't find it widely useful, because of a lack of clarity and a great deal of baggage. I would never confidently use the term on the internet, or in other public conversation, without explaining what I mean, first. For that reason, more specific terminology ("GMless collaborative roleplaying games which do X and Y...") is easier and clearer, in my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476391/#Comment_476391" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-24T19:33:25+00:00" title="August 24, 2018  7:33PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2018 7:54PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>We may be talking past each other, I\u2019m not sure.

Please correct me if I make a mistake.<br/>1. A term contrasting MLwM with trad rpgs on the Forge.<br/>2. This forum, a community, a virtual space.<br/>3. A style of play, focusing on creating a good 'story'.<br/>4. Ben Lehman's design space and familiar things (Tall Pines etc).<br/>5. Something wider than 4., including most of the 'indie' games (ie. PbtAs), which is like an anti cathegory, saying something like 'not trad, not osr'<br/>6. An umbrella term for activities using 'fictional positioning' in their feedback loop. RPGs, Microscope, Story Dice, maybe even improv theater? (Sidenote: Drama in Education/Process Drama uses the term 'dramatic play' which IMHO encompassess nearly the same cognitive space).<br/><br/>Man, I had faith in the term but maybe we should really not use 'story game' any more if we want to avoid confusion and perpetual misunderstanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476406/#Comment_476406" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-25T13:02:29+00:00" title="August 25, 2018  1:02PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" rel="nofollow">hamnacb</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Man, I had faith in the term but maybe we should really not use 'story game' any more if we want to avoid confusion and perpetual misunderstanding.</p></div></blockquote>\nWho is having any actual confusion or stress about the term?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hyades" title="hyades"><img alt="hyades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nC00J8GI62UXP.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hyades">hyades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476410/#Comment_476410" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-25T16:35:30+00:00" title="August 25, 2018  4:35PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Who is having any actual confusion or stress about the term?<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<br/>Most recent I've seen was Patrick Stuart (of OSR fame) who commented <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PatrickStuart/posts/74KA1uhrtpX" rel="nofollow">here</a>:<br/>"Honestly I increasingly have no idea what I mean when I say story game.

And this is more or less my point, too: I generally see people who have strong feelings on the topic trying to address a <b>preference</b> they have when it comes to games. This might be to qualify a group of games they enjoy playing, or to disqualify a group of games they don't enjoy.<br/><br/>I agree very strongly with your suggestion to just add a little information - that will typically do the trick, in my experience as well (at the very worst, your audience might now be interested in asking a few follow-up questions to see what you mean, rather than assuming you're talking about their favourite/least favourite type of game). I recommend this approach to anyone who feels the need to use the term in any kind of "strict" fashion!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476457/#Comment_476457" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-28T16:14:31+00:00" title="August 28, 2018  4:14PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few other quotes, for reference:<br/><br/>1. Wikipedia's page on "indie roleplaying" has the following blurb about this forum, which I think is based on statements made by or even directly written by the people who run the forum (being deliberately vague here, since I don't know when this was done).\n<blockquote><i>Story Games</i> is a discussion forum dedicated to role-playing games that focus on shared story creation. Many of the story games discussed on this site take their core from improv theater games (like in the TV show Whose Line Is It Anyway?), but are played around a table by describing what happens in the story, rather than by getting up and acting it out. A story game is a type of role-playing game experience with a lesser focus on "My Character" and a greater focus on "Our Story" (meaning the story that all the players at the table want to make). <br/><br/><i>As an experience</i>, most RPGs can be played "Story Games Style" with a little adjustment. <i>As a game</i>, some games are particularly created by their designers to aim for a meaningful 'Story Games' experience.<br/><br/>A majority of the games discussed and created on <i>Story Games</i> are indie and/or small press games.</blockquote>\n2. A short blurb from the "Welcome to Story Games" topic on the forum (accessed August 28, 2018) addresses this briefly, as well:\n<blockquote>This is a discussion community for people talking about roleplaying games. It tends to center around smaller and indie games, but there's still good discussions to be had about larp and more mainstream games.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476461/#Comment_476461" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-29T00:35:15+00:00" title="August 29, 2018 12:35AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In my experience on the internet, the people who feel strongly about the term "story game" are people who want to be able to classify a whole swath of games as undesirable. <br/><br/>Most often, this takes the form of something like, "We play real RPGs here; no story games allowed!"<br/><br/>(For whatever reason, these people will often write the term as "storygame", a single composite noun.)<br/><br/>When you take a strong stance like this, it becomes important to be able to draw a clear line somewhere.<br/><br/> As far as this forum is concerned, despite its name, it seems to me that the participants enjoy a variety of games (as seen by all the threads about D&amp;D and OSR lately, for instance).

My curiosity about the definition is to get a more accurate understanding of the label (or at least, one that is informed by a wider variety of opinion).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476462/#Comment_476462" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-29T00:56:49+00:00" title="August 29, 2018 12:56AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me!<br/><br/>As far as I can see, we've covered most definitions and uses I've ever heard of in this thread. <br/><br/>Has anyone heard other uses or definitions?<br/><br/>Do you have a personal preferred usage, Brendan?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476469/#Comment_476469" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-29T14:28:36+00:00" title="August 29, 2018  2:28PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over time, the term "story game" and "trad game" have become increasingly less useful to me. <br/><br/>You generally use a term like that in certain cases:<br/><br/><b>1.

I think my walking definitions of these things are pretty vague at this point. It is a bit like OSR or Traditional RPG, it can mean a lot of different things depending on what you are focusing on. What first leaps to mind when I hear Story Game, is Fiasco and games like that. I also sometimes think of it as a spectrum. But I see it used as well to apply to very story focused RPGs. I was curious what the lines here might be, especially since it seems like some folks view it as a kind of game, and others view it as something else (like a way of thinking about games). <br/><br/>I do think it is true that there are a lot of other types of games being played here. I've noticed a lot more old school topics. I've always assumed this was because of the impact of a game like Dungeon World.

It being very much a story-after-the-fact though is very non-storygame, along with players in PbtA games lacking the power to declare things in the fiction that are unrelated to their character. They're very trad-adjacent in their structure. <br/><br/>That being said, this whole definition thing isn't something I'm terribly passionate about, so if somebody wants to call AW a storygame, I really don't give a fuck.

A good number of gamers and designers who were active on the Forge got excited about B/X D&amp;D about ten years ago (maybe a little more, actually - but I don't remember specific dates), so there's always been a significant number of "story gamers" who were into OSR-style play, including major designers like Vincent Baker and Ben Lehman. <br/><br/>For a long time, it seemed to me that those Forge characters were *responsible* for starting up the OSR movement, though I no longer think this is the case. (It's too widespread, and many of the people involved have been doing this for decades!) So it appears to be just a coincidence that many Forge personalities also independently discovered a love for old-school D&amp;D around the same time the "OSR" appeared as a trend on the internet.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, there isn't a really strong connection between OSR fans and <i>Dungeon World</i> fans, although there are a few people who seem interested in both (like Johnstone Metzger and his <i>Dungeon Planet</i> books). Certainly the interest in OSR-style gaming among people "in story game circles" (I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek) predates <i>Dungeon World</i>, in any case.<br/><br/>(For what it's worth, I'm a person who likes OSR-style gaming but has little interest in <i>Dungeon World</i>. And I'm hardly unique in that regard.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476487/#Comment_476487" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-29T23:37:23+00:00" title="August 29, 2018 11:37PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><br/>(For what it's worth, I'm a person who likes OSR-style gaming but has little interest in <i>Dungeon World</i>.

They may be very different and not appealing to everyone who likes "RPGs" but there's no universally appealing "RPG". <br/><br/>And with the name of this site and what is welcomed for discussion, it doesn't seem useful to try and apply "story games" to some specific subset of games (which almost certainly doesn't include D&amp;D which is quite actively discussed here).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476549/#Comment_476549" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-04T17:43:39+00:00" title="September  4, 2018  5:43PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My suspicion is that a lot of people who want to use the term "story games" to mean "some type of game that is not an RPG" are basically just looking to be exclusionary, AND are probably defining "RPG" as "a game in which the players only influence the world by way of their characters, ideally with associated mechanics because reasons."  - i.e. basically the opposite of the Ben description of Story Games.<br/><br/>Which, ironically, actually does more or less make a reasonably useful unified theory.
