This was my third time playing and first time with the new rules. And they really added a lot to the game!<br/><br/>In brief, there are now two small sets of cards to draw during the game. Fate cards for when you want to shake things up, and Resolution cards for resolving conflicts when necessary. Also he renamed a few of the ritual phrases and added a new one. Besides that, much of the game is functionally the same; just a little better organized.<br/><br/>We were playing a one shot and needed something pretty tight so we could hit our Destiny Points quickly. During the pitching session, I had an idea for oasis in the desert, and Peterson was thinking of the jungle as well. But it was his idea to do Gold Rush-era California that really hit us. I added that it was Yosemite Valley before the real rush of adventurers arrived, but there were already tensions between Indians and the white men. And there had been hot, drought-like conditions which were very odd up in the Sierra Mountains.<br/><br/>Weeks really wanted to move things in wierd directions, like mysticism and shamans and such. He called it "magical realism".  So we toned it down a bit, but made sure it was part of the game.<br/><br/>Each player takes control of a certain element in the game, and has veto power over the content of it. This acts as a bit of a power balance since this is a shared-GM game. <br/><i>Peterson: Magic<br/>Bennett: Culture<br/>Weeks: Nature</i><br/><br/><b>Map</b><br/>Part of a situation generation is to take a piece of paper and start writing down "islands", or whatever the analog is for your game. So we added:<br/>-Sycamore Pass: the town at the edge of the map that leads back to San Francisco.<br/>-Blackjack Camp: the burgeoning encampment that many of the miners live in.<br/>-Comstock Lode: the recent huge mine that was discovered, and that the miners are currently fighting over possession of.<br/>-Sacred Indian Burial Ground: overlapping the Comstock Lode, which is making the Indians none too pleased.<br/>-Nahuatl Cenote: an ancient underground reservoir that is reputed to be the source of mystical powers.<br/><br/><b>Characters:</b><br/>I played <i>"Red" Farley</i>, an old prospector who has been living symbiotically with the Indians, but is finding himself caught in the crossfire as cultures clash. He's married to an Inuit woman named Tsenaaq, who is secretly a sorceress. He's got a mule named after his first girlfriend, Sarah. And his best friend was Billy's uncle, Carl.<br/><br/>Peterson played <i>Billy McEwen</i>, a young prospector from San Francisco who was leaving his family in SF and seeking his fortune because doesn't want a "square job". He's an educated man and doesn't believe in all the "mysticism" he hears about. He's got a new hat, a horse and a dog named Cody.<br/><br/>Weeks played <i>Zheng Dingfa</i>, a Chinese wayfarer searching for the ultimate source of magic. This Tai Chi master, numerologist and herbalist is over 80 years old and wears his red hair in a long braid. He's became a eunich at a young age, and carries his possessions on him, including his cricket in a small cage.<br/><br/><b>Destiny Points:</b><br/>These are a key part of the game. Each player looks at the other players and writes several possible destiny points for the other characters. These are important events to drive towards during play. Each player then takes the several possible destiny points that were given to him and picks one out that is interesting to them, modifying it if necessary. And then each player writes it down on a card and puts it on the table so all the players know where the story should be leading to. It seems counter-intuitive to know what story end you are driving at. But in play, it really focuses the gameplay, and especially in the one-shot, you don't spend much time flailing around because you literally don't have time to waste.<br/><i>Red</i> must fight for possession of Tsenaaq with her first husband, Strong Knife.<br/><i>Billy</i> is faced with a magical vision he cannot deny, and resorts to savagery.<br/><i>Zheng</i> has the vision of a beautiful Indian princess appear before him and offer to reverse his eunuch state.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232390/#Comment_232390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T23:07:25+00:00" title="September 14, 2009 11:07PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Story</b><br/>Billy is a newcomer from SF and grabs some gear at Sycamore Pass. He has a run in with a weird old guy who tries to scare him off.<br/><br/>"Red" walks to Blackjack Camp with his mule and his wife to find his mining pick that has gone "missing". He corners the young orphan miscreant there named Ratch, who has his face stuffed into a sack filled with some sort of dust-like drug that he is evidently getting high from. The kid says he sold it to the Chinese guy Zhang, who is in the Indian burial grounds. Red suspects BS and takes Ratch with him to make sure he gets the pick back.<br/><br/>Zheng leaves the burial grounds and goes to Red's hut nearby to leave the pick and "borrow" some more tools. But Tsenaaq's first husband, the sullen Indian warrior named Strong Knife, was watching from afar. Zheng returns the pick, but finds a mystical red gem in Tsenaaq's things that makes his cricket go crazy. Zheng realizes it is an item of great power and suspends the gem from a gold chain attached to his back tooth and hanging (safely?) inside of his stomach. He leaves the hut in a hurry, and Strong Knife wonders why he didn't appear to have stole anything else from the hut.<br/><br/>Billy bypasses Blackjack Camp and heads straight from Sycamore Pass to the Comstock Lode to set up his camp. But another claimer named Bret quickly sets him straight and says "you can't just setup a claim anywhere you want!" Billy needs to go to the Assay Office in Blackjack Camp to make a claim. Billy eats some chili from the chuckwagon before making his departure at sunset.<br/><br/>As Red approaches his hut in the evening, the forest goes completely still. It gets very muggy outside and lightning sets a faraway grove of trees on fire. Red sends Tsenaaq on ahead to close up the hut, and huge downpour cuts into the drought-stricken area. Tsenaaq gets to the hut first, notices that the pickaxe is back and their things have been gone through. So she runs to get stuff and finds that her magical red gem is gone! At that moment, she looks out the window and sees Strong Knife silhouetted against the lightning. <br/><br/>Zheng walks back to the burial grounds right as the stillness hits before the storm. He sees the campfire of Billy, who has retreated to an isolated part of the Comstock Lode, not realizing that it is sacred ground for the Indians. Zheng had been using Red's pick to dig a hold connecting his cave home to Nahuatl Cenote, the magical aquifer. The rain comes in sheets, and Zheng offers Billy shelter in his cave.<br/><br/>While Billy is drying himself off, we cut back to Tsenaaq sneaking out of Red's hut to confront Strong Knife, who finally shows some backbone by wanting to kill Red. Tsenaaq shows she still has feeling for Strong Knife, but she wants to keep Red safe as well.<br/><br/>Back in the cave, Zheng has Billy lay down and they partake of the magic opium pipe. Billy sees the light that appears behing Zheng's eyes and can actually see his golden breath. Zheng starts to tell one story, but other words come out of his mouth. Things are getting quite strange at this point. Suddenly Billy sees light all the way around a huge stone that is separating the back of the cave from the entrance to the magical aquifer.<br/><br/>In the middle of the night, Billy wakes up but still feels like he is in a dream state. He goes to the huge rock and starts to push it aside. At the same time, Zheng sees a presence of a god Shakkatchayo. <br/><br/>At the same time, Red runs out into the rain and confronts Tsenaaq and Strong Knife. He attacks the Indian warrior with his pickaxe, but he accidentally sticks his wife in the chest as he is swinging it around. Seeing his wife dying due to his mistake, Red freaks out, drops the pickaxe and runs away to the burial grounds, leaving Strong Knife on the ground, wounded in the leg and unable to follow.<br/><br/>As Tsenaaq dies, her spirit flies into the red gem that is hanging in Zheng's stomach. Zheng starts to become younger and the parts of him body which have dwindled by age (or choice) start to come back. Weeks describes this freaky transformation has Zheng goes from being a eunuch to being a multi-gendered creature. Zheng walks towards the bright opening that Billy already walked through and sees nothing else. Zheng is transcending.<br/><br/>Billy sees Zheng transform and walking towards him into the white light of the tunnel. Red stumbles into the cave, his front covered in Tsenaaq's blood. Billy fills with rage after seeing the transformation of Zheng, block's Red's way, and shoot him in the chest three times his his revolver.<br/><br/>As Red dies, the cavern starts to collapse around them, and Billy freaks out and runs away with his horse and dog. He heads straight back to SF for a quite life and a square job.<br/><br/><b>Thoughts</b><br/>We spent about two hours explaining the game and creating the situation, map, characters and destiny points. Which only left about two hours to play. But after flailing around with the first set of scenes (which always happens to me with this game), we all got on the same wavelength and started driving HARD towards out destiny points. <br/><br/>The scene when Zheng was making his transcendence was narrated really well by Weeks, and we are all feeling it. In two hours of play we saw a complete story arc for all three of these characters. And best of all, it made SENSE.<br/><br/>If you haven't tried this game yet, you need to. I guarantee you will learn something about collaborative storytelling, and you just might have a great time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232407/#Comment_232407" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T03:23:52+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  3:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love seeing what you're doing with Archipelago, Chris.

I pulled a Fate card when Red was making his way back to his hut, which caused the rainstorm to start. Weeks wasn't sure at first if that was enough of a change (he was getting freaky and wanted it to rain frogs, and I requested a different solution). But really, the start of the rain was the beginning of the end for the characters' stories. And an effective (if accidental) metaphor.<br/><br/>We used the resolution cards several times, and they seemed to work well. It made sense in play that you had to have another player define the outcome for you. The two key times we drew these were Red's fight with Strong Knife (when he accidently killed his wife) and Billy's shooting of Red and subsequent freakout.<br/><br/>It's fucking poetic I tell you.<br/><br/>And the use of ritual phrases along with these new cards means that this is probably the best game I have played in terms of it feeling "GM-full" rather than "GM-less". Maybe this game and Montsegur:1244.<br/><br/>We need more AP posts for this game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232450/#Comment_232450" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T09:26:55+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  9:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2009 9:27AM by Matthijs.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>We need more AP posts for this game!</blockquote>\nYeah.

I think Bennett asked Weeks to "try it a different way" (when Weeks wanted it to rain frogs). I can't remember any other uses. I don't know if that is good news or bad. Were we all playing on the same wavelength? My feeling is that the rules are there for a reason, so we should be trying them (all) out, pushing the story in unexpected directions.
