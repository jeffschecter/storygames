In the tradition of Matt Wilson, I'd like to know what ought to be changed, so I'm asking.  I already know we're changing:  <br/><br/>* The cover<br/>* The map errors that cause paroxysms of mirth for our customers in central Europe<br/>* Some of the situation elements that never get picked (who thought <i>those </i>up?)<br/>* Some verbiage about the whole big die = failure, small die = success thing, which throws people all the time<br/>* Some verbiage about playing the first few chapters<br/>* One or two typographical errors and one layout error<br/><br/>What else?  What needs better explanation, or more discussion, or more precision, or whatever?  What's missing?  What would be helpful, and what should be neatly excised and never mentioned again?  Lay it on me, and thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171915/#Comment_171915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T11:42:59+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 11:42AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you make it a bit more cheery?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171923/#Comment_171923" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T12:14:06+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 12:14PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll try to remember to look over my book and offer thoughts.<br/><br/>Here's a positive: the bookmark that I got with mine (at GenCon 2007) was invaluable during play. First, it helped us remember what we were supposed to be doing at any given time. ("Oh hey, it's time for Radio Lightning.") Second, it marked the Chapter that we were on so we could find Radio Lightning, etc.<br/><br/>Oh, a random thought: a record sheet for the game, divided by Chapters, might be nice. So, there'd be a place to write down the situation elements that were selected, the new locations of each marker on the Grid, if a given player's Personal Scene succeeded or failed, and the like. Oh, additionally, this dream sheet would have the Chapter number, the Chapter title, and the date. (I happen to think that knowing the date of the events in a Chapter is important.)<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171925/#Comment_171925" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T12:19:00+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 12:19PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2008 12:19PM by Jesse.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>Some verbiage as to what kind of material is appropriate for a Mission Scene vs. a Personal Scene.  Particularly in regards to what makes a good goal in a Personal Scene and what Success/Failure in a Mission Scene refers to.<br/><br/>I say this because something our group did is something that I don't think is actually in the text.  When we framed a Grey Rank into a Mission Scene we also gave them an explicit objective that was a submission.  So if the whole Mission was about sabotaging a power plant then when we framed mission scene we'd say something like, "Okay, Grom you have to go get us the blue prints to the power plant."  And then the die contributed determined the success or failure of that specific sub-mission.<br/><br/>But again I don't think that's in the text.  The text is a bit murky and says "other players frame mission scenes" and the die contributed determines if the character will succeed or fail.... but I'm not sure it ever says, "at what."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171926/#Comment_171926" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T12:21:20+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 12:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, keep 'em coming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171929/#Comment_171929" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T12:23:50+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 12:23PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be helpful if the character sheet listed the four grid corners with bubbles you could fill in when you hit them.

Quite a few of the personal scenes were falling flat and the players were very happy to fail the scenes to avoid a corner square on the grid.  A bit of discussion and we quickly realised that we were falling victim to the Czege Principle: the player was framing the scene, specifying the conflict, and then resolving it.  We changed our procedures of play so that while a player <i>frames</i> their own personal scene, they don't say anything about the conflict; we discover what the conflict is during play in that scene.  <br/><br/>We quickly generated a bunch of scenes that were much more compelling and tense.  <br/><br/>Oh, another thing!  As part of chargen, you say that each player should describe another NPC and write them down on a card.  It would be a helpful prod to suggest that people do the same thing with all the other NPCs that get generated in play: write down their name, description, and Reputation on a card.  It helps reincorporation during the game.  <br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174341/#Comment_174341" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T11:49:38+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 11:49AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Examples of reputations that aren't all 180 degree oposites of each other and possibly a small clarification explaining as much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174351/#Comment_174351" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T13:09:27+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  1:09PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rockin'; thanks guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175886/#Comment_175886" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-23T03:21:33+00:00" title="October 23, 2008  3:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One other thing that came out of our game: a bit of clarification on when Reputation dice can get traded up.

If you're always contributing a d4 from your reputation, doesn't that mean that your character is always acting childishly?  We took the reading that in order for a PC to act maturely, the player had to contribute a larger die.  <br/><br/>I get that you could narrate the increasing maturity in extremis when the reputation die is swapped, but that doesn't seem to gel as well with the fiction and the PC growing up during the Rising.  Perhaps it's something that could do with a bit more discussion in any revised version.  <br/><br/>Also, who had the idea of putting possible NPC names around the edges of the character sheet?
