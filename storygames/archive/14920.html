We played "Dragon Slayers", and while things did go pear-shaped, it wasn't quite "No Country for Old Men," which is kinda where my expectations were set, having never played it. My character (an elf matron) actually ended up pretty fine, rolling a 10 or 11 at the end. Crazy: a human sorceress raised by elves conjured the spirit of her mother into a golem, which, down the line, actually turned out to be housing the malignant and immensely powerful spirit of an elder god.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339359/#Comment_339359" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T23:20:03+00:00" title="August 17, 2011 11:20PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>which, down the line, actually turned out to be housing the malignant and immensely powerful spirit of an elder god.</blockquote>\nIt just goes to show that you should never mess with the boundaries between life and death.<br/>...in retrospect, though, I really need to learn to start discussing with the other players, out-of-character, where I want to lead the story and get feedback and consent before I do these things, instead of just doing them and leaving the other players guessing.

Supplement treadmill man, supplement treadmill. Edit: These big game designers, all they care about is the money. They don't care about the little guy at all.<br/><br/>Ahem.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was the Mission to Mercury playset. I played in a demo game at Leisure Games so it's possible others who were there are here. My only real query was the choice of playset since apparently that's an advanced one and we were all nnewbies, but we did ok.<br/><br/>It was tons of fun. Our expedition fell apart in a welter of relationship issues (between my technical director and a drunken handyman), conflicts between the civilian and military mission commanders over jurisdiction and an ambitious number two who ended up assuming overall command but then suffered a tragic accident at the moment of triumph leaving him paraplegic and unable to enjoy his own success.<br/><br/>The moment which sticks out most was when we had the funeral of the handyman who had been killed by security after attacking a senior officer in a moment of drunken fury. It was my scene and as my character tried to say some closing words to her former lover she played a recording she had found which she hoped would show the kind of man he was. I turned to the other player and asked him what was on the recording at which point he sang a drunken song in Russian and the rest of us had our characters standing there at this ghastly funeral pretending to be respectful while this blatantly inappropriate song played in the background.<br/><br/>I also liked an early scene where the entire mission command structure lined up outside the dome following landing (which nearly went disastrously wrong as we established in a flashback). We all watched the Mercury landscape drinking in the history of the moment. Then the commander made a speech, someone quibbled about a point they made, and shortly afterwards the entire group dissolved into bitter arguments and recriminations - the Mercury landscape quite forgotten.<br/>It doesn't sound like much, but it was so petty on all sides that I rather loved it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339415/#Comment_339415" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T07:51:42+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  7:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>Nah, I thought it was great.

I think this is the first AP i've seen of it since the Companion came out.<br/><br/>It's a very easy setting to picture. That said I kept forgetting it was on Mercury rather than Mars.<br/><br/>The red dice mechanic didn't do much for me in all honesty, but flashbacks were pretty easy to work in. It just meant we had to check a couple of times that we all had the sequence of events straight in our heads. We had established there'd been an incident in orbit, and we flashed back to it during play and it helped flesh out character dynamics. That worked well. The confessionals didn't do any harm, but I thought they had less oomph than the more traditional scenes and the extra die colour seemed needless complexity.<br/><br/>First playthrough though.
