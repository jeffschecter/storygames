Many of the people who show are recurring, but we get some new blood every once in a while. It is a VERY mixed group with regards to play style and tastes and such. Last Wednesday, I ran "Danger Patrol," using the "Attack of the Crimson Apes" teaser. We only had about 3 hours, so I had to rush things a little bit, but a fun time was had by all, and we got through an entire ACTION-INTERLUDE-SUSPENSE-ACTION cycle, and reached a good conclusion to our episode.<br/><br/>Casey Tennison: Robot Detective (KC-10 model). Thinks he's Sam Spade.<br/>Dr. Spectra: Ghost Professor, harnesses aetheric energy and science for the good of man<br/>Lightning! : Atomic Flyboy, patriotic do-gooder<br/>"Raven" : Two-Fisted Daredevil, civic-minded and has his own youth group (The Raven Cubs)<br/>Agent M: Psychic Agent, master of disguise and shadow-lurking<br/><br/>Setup the setting and teaser for them.<br/><br/>Our group is a motley bunch. Their "last week..." vignettes were all over the map. Mysterious Dame walked into my office. Fighting a neferious Crimson Republic agent. Tinkering in the lab. Giving a rousing speech to Raven Cubs. Arguing with a store clerk (yes).<br/><br/>They get into the action of the teaser pretty well, describing themselves doing cool things and mining for danger dice (I'm hanging off the edge of the Hawks 5000, while he's doing evasive maneuvers, and grabbing the Crimson Ape as we fly past. And oh, yeah, the fire spreads and I'm engulfed by it.) Even after it is clear how much narrative power they have, and how non-simulation-engine the mechanics are, I'm still being asked stuff like "How far away is that building?" and "What's the range on my telekinesis" and "How much does the Ape weigh?" and being asked for permission for them to do cool things.<br/><br/>Throughout the scene, they are rolling fairly well, and the Psychic is soaking lots of danger giving re-rolls. I'm requiring 7 hits per threat, and they are still doing just fine. Between rounds, I often arbitrarily put a countdown timer on an ape or newly hatched threat, just to keep a sense of, well, DANGER. And after a little while, I'm spawning new threats at cost of only 2 danger, and giving out full hits at 3 danger cost. They usually just knock it down to a reduced hit anyhow, so it's cool. <br/><br/>Interludes went well, with lots of following-up and some tying-together of the diverse elements from the battle and the "last week..." vignettes. One of the new threats from the action scene was a military zeppelin that got accidentally placed on defensive alert by our heroes and started shooting up civilian vehicles. And the professor had got ahold of one of the Apes from the battle. So in the interlude, I have each of them start going in some direction they want to check out, but stop them short of finding out too much yet.<br/><br/>I handle the Suspense round quite differently from the rules. Rather than play it like an action round, I have each of them roll once to Discover Stuff in the area they want to investigate. Successes let them specify facts about what's going on. Danger results let me specify things. So, for example, when the professor opened up one of the ape brains, she got 3 successes and 1 danger. So I let her go into great detail about how they brains were cybernetic, and obviously Crimson Republic tech. Then I asked her if she knew who was controlling the apes, and she said they had to have come from the Zeppelin. For my 1 result, I have her fellow university researcher Dr. Karpov (a Crimson Republic defector!) come in while she's got the ape head open, look inside, and get very concerned.<br/><br/>In this way, the detective (2 success, 0 danger) was able to then specify that he found out who was responsible for the zeppelin attack, and that Dr. Karpov was an unwitting accomplice.<br/><br/>Lightning! (1 success, 2 danger) found out from his flyboy buddies that flyboys were being recruited for some big experimental project. I then said that the project was actually a sinister Crimson plot, and that the flyboys were having their brains implanted into fightercraft.<br/><br/>Agent M tracked down the store clerk he was arguing with (2 success, 2 danger), and got photos of him with his accomplices. I said he found out the clerk was a Crimson agent, and had a personal grudge against Agent M and Raven.<br/><br/>Raven (1 success) inspired a newspaper story about the Raven Cubs and how they were eating lots of vegetables so they could be strong like him when they grow up.<br/><br/>So I took all this and made the last action scene. A surprise Zeppelin attack! By robots and cybernetic apes! With AI fighter escort guided by unwilling flyboy brains! And a Crimson Agent holding Raven Cubs hostage! And calling out Agent M personally! All coordinated by Karpov's assistants, Igor and Svetlana!<br/><br/>Gave them a LOT of markers out on the board for this scene. Letsee. 12-hit Zeppelin with 1 resistance. 2 suicidal AI fighters with (2) countdown markers on them, 3 groups of 6-hit robot-ape patrols out in the city, a 7-hit Raven Cubs in Peril marker with a (1) countdown on it. A (2) countdown marker of Igor has Karpov, University overrun by Apes! and Svetlana at a command console in the university.<br/><br/>They mopped it up pretty well, even with me seemingly overloading the board with stuff, launching new threats on just 2 danger, and handing out full hits like beads at Mardi Gras. The Psychic maxed out on Danger, and saved his power markers to barely dodge vaporization a few times. His head was throbbing and ready to explode the whole time. I stunned and injured the Two-Fisted Daredevil a few times, much to his joy, as he actually gets quite awesome when he's hurt. The robot detective got his head knocked off, which flowed straight into him using a power marker for a floating-head 2-action turn where Svetlana was caught by surprise that this detective could survive decapitation and then have body-and-head tag-team her into submission.<br/><br/>It was a really great time. I think the economy of the mechanics needs some major examination. It certainly also depends upon what the typical intended length of an episode would be. Personally, I favor the idea of ACTION-INTERLUDE-SUSPENSE-ACTION being the whole cycle of an episode. And then striving to balance the mechanics to fit that cycle. But the materials are great, the mix-and-match character sheets were a big hit, and the jump-in-and-play and fast-action-pacing elements earned a lot of buy-in, even from those couple who were a bit dubious or unfamiliar about the genre.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270381/#Comment_270381" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T12:52:34+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 12:52PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Mark, thanks for this great AP.<br/><br/>I fully agree with your assessment there at the end. The exact cost for threat moves and how the game economy flows is really critical and all the numbers aren't quite right yet. Close, though, I think.<br/><br/>I think the way you did Suspense is <i>really</i> interesting. I'm gonna let it percolate in the ol' mind-grapes for a few days, but right now, I'm pretty psyched about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270384/#Comment_270384" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T13:38:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  1:38PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark: I'm impressed you got though the whole ACTION-INTERLUDE-SUSPENSE-ACTION sequence with five (!) players some or all of whom are new to the narrative power thing.  I wish I could have watched and learned some things.<br/><br/>I think your Suspense experiment was crackerjack.  It may or may not be right for DP to have Suspense scenes with a different mechanic from the Action scenes, but it seems like it was effective and I can imagine it as being fun to play that way.  Probably also a faster way to run Suspense scenes than as differently-framed/colored Action scenes.<br/><br/>Raven Cubs...

The times I've run the beta of Danger Patrol, the Suspense scenes kinda dragged, as there were no really immediate consequences for rolling badly, and characters would just keep rolling turn after turn until they finally succeeded. With this version, you'd definitely have a quick resolution that'd give both the player and the Game Master a bit of narrative control for the next scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh" title="Josh_Unruh"><img alt="Josh_Unruh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh_Unruh">Josh_Unruh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270444/#Comment_270444" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T10:58:44+00:00" title="May  8, 2010 10:58AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That might depend on how you handle the danger in those scenes, SG. I had a Suspense scene result in the cops chasing Danger Patrol members under an Amber Alert because they kidnapped a robot that looked like a little girl (and I didn't even make Small Wonder jokes! DAMN!). This was a direct result of what they were trying to do and the danger we put on the dice.<br/><br/>I like this style of Suspense scene because that's usually when I, as GM, have to start tying a bow on things and a little help from those ingrates on the other side of the screen is a big plus.<br/><br/>What? Am I the only one with a group that tries to give ridiculous things that I can't hope to tie together? Yeah, that's part of my gang's fun in Danger Patrol now...the jerks! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
