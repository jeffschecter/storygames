It's about writing stuff that's engaging (at one level or another) first and foremost. Or in other words, good games.

So, the players get to create the clues. Inspiration in Adventure! is much along the same lines: it gives expanded authorial control to non-GM players.

However, i've dealt with a lot of other RPers who, when they're not the GM, don't want any authorial control beyond their own character. Hell, i'm pulling teeth right now trying to get my current group to engage in such radical activities as deciding for themselves whether or not the character cursed to always have the wrong people fall for her happens to have at this very moment a love note from such a person on her person, rather than me doing all the deciding. [After a lengthy post-game analysis, i realized that when they suggested that, and i responded "you could have such a thing" meaning "if that's what you want, then say so, and it is so", they seem to have heard "maybe--but it'll depend on some sort of determination that the GM or the rules have yet to make".]<br/><br/>So, Esoterrorists has figured out a way to handle investigation scenarios that (1) doesn't risk coming to a grinding hault and (2) works within a traditional RPG structure, where only the GM has authorial input on the rest of the world beyond the PCs. Now, maybe, this, too, is prefigured in other works that i'm just not familiar with.

I remember a lot of it, but it's a hard read, and I'm finding some themes that I think I may have missed the first time through. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the themes is "some things can only be done once." When Ungoliant comes and destroys the light of the two trees in Valmar, at the urging of Melkor, and all light but the stars leaves the world, Yavanna comes to the site of the disaster, and says precisely this, "some things can only be done once." Can she just make the trees again? No. And this is why Feanor will not give up the Silmarills, he says that it would kill him to do so, because he put all of himself into that one project. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow often have you said of your favorite rock band, "You know, I still prefer the early stuff, it's their best work." ? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that's just a theme. One can hope that lightning will strike twice. And then you always have the Assimovs of the world, people who can churn out goodness over and over and over (Sorensen?). I think that to the extent that somebody makes something spectacular, it greatly reduces the chances of them repeating or exceeding that spectacular event. Seems pretty obvious on the face of it in some ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say the Reign isn't a good game... it is. It's just not as spectacularly out there as, say, Unknown Armies was for it's time. That's not to say that Law's new edition of Hero Quest won't be a huge improvement... I'm pretty certain that it will be. It's just not going to be the landmark that, say, Feng Shui was. Etc, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's not to say that the next big thing won't come from Stolze, or Laws, or Tweet, or Tynes, et al. It might. But I think that it's just as likely to come from sombody who was like those guys were before they made their big contributions. Why not somebody else? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think expecting the same people to be ground-breaking over and over is just not realistic. They've got a shot at it, but so do lots of other people. And these things are so relative. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe brilliantness of these folks is not gone. It's just being built on by others. Far from expecting them to continue to brighten our RPG world, we owe them a debt of gratitude for what they've already done. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr that's just how I see it. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou want something new? Something brilliant? OK, make it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so easy? Well then understand that it's not easy for anybody. Age aside, Shreyas... when can we expect to see the world-shaking Torchbearer from the young designer? Should be easy for you, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98587/#Comment_98587" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T08:41:48+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  8:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: woodelf</cite>OK, pulled out Esoterrorists and InSpectres for a quick re-read, just to make sure it wasn't my faulty memory.

As I said, Inspectres does it better (IMHO). You can spend a point of inspiration to get clues from the Storyteller. This is, essentially, Esoterrorists with added ressource management (spend a point). It doesn't force anyone to step out of their role and author things (like dramatic editing, for instance).

I believe Sorensen's Inspectres addresses investigations in a more interesting way than<i>Eso</i>and it predates it by many, many years.<br><br>I was doing this years ago and far from being the first. I lifted and tweaked the concept from Clinton Nixon's<a href="http://www.crngames.com/donjon/index" rel="nofollow">Donjon</a>(facts) and White Wolf's Adventure! (Inspiration) as well as years of actual play, fudging and exchanging tips with dozens of GMs who have tackled with clues/railroading issues. I've used variations in Story Engine, CORPS, GURPS for five years or so. My hacks are not terribly well-made (it looks much like Eso, with the addition that you can state facts by spending inspiration) but it's suitable considering investigative procedures aren't center-stage.<br/><br/>Robin Laws is much like John Wick. The intent behind the design rocks but man, does he struggle to implement them in his games. I was expecting a lot of flavorful stuff but instead it's just a bland variation on a concept pretty much everyone already uses with the exception of hardcore immersionists.<br/><br/>Designing games based on perfecting working procedures instead of aiming for the Awesome has its disadvantages.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98628/#Comment_98628" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T10:21:27+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 10:21AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Esoterrorists is new ground.

Now, maybe, this, too, is prefigured in other works that i'm just not familiar with. But it's definitely not the same thing you see in InSpectres, Adventure!, or Donjon.</blockquote>\nYeah, didn't mean to imply Donjon or Inspectres were the same. As I said, Inspectres does it better (IMHO). You can spend a point of inspiration to get clues from the Storyteller. This is, essentially, Esoterrorists with added ressource management (spend a point). It doesn't force anyone to step out of their role and author things (like dramatic editing, for instance). It strikes me as a perfect medium and it's something I much prefer to the automatic nature of Eso.<br/><br/>I think we're using the word "innovation" differently. When i say "innovation" i mean "something new"--so the system in Esoterrorists is, AFAIK, something new. You appear to mean "something better" when you say "innovation"--and, for you, the system in Esoterrorists is inferior to already-existing mechanics. Unless i'm misreading you? You don't seem to be claiming that somebody else did the same thing first, you seem to be saying that the similar things that were done earlier are better, and the ways in which Esoterrorists differ (and is therefore new) make it worse. Is that right?<br/><br/>As for your specific points: every time you succeed in InSpectres, you have to narrate your success, which, at least in some cases, will require authorial input, i'd think. Certainly any time you succeed on an Academics roll to learn something, you know have to say what you've learned, thus defining the truth of the world.

My fault. <br/><br/>Adventure! has all sorts of things like <i>dramatic editing</i>, which you might be thinking of. The ways to use inspiration are on page 153. You can do all sorts of things. Look up "<i>intuition</i>".  I'll quote:<br/><br/><b>Luck is always on the hero's side in pulp stories. By spending an Inspiration, you can ask the Storyteller for a useful hint or to point you in the best direction for the story. This isn't character precognition, nor is it just "maybe you don't want your character to open that door."<br/>The Storyteller gives you essential information that helps your character to move the story along. She might provide the essential clue needed to discover a murderer's identity, suggest a line of reasoning that reveals the enemy's plan or simply point out that you've been chasing a red herring and that the heart of the story is back at the lab.</b><br/><br/>Skimming through Adventure! again, I am reminded how much this small book improved my overall gaming. I don't even care for pulp and it's one of the last books I would part with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
