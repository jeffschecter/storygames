The Institution said it was for your enrichment. But now the Captain\u2019s dead, and the only things he\u2019s left you with are nightmares, a dwindling supply of dehydrated food, and them- your fellow crew. There are times when the ghost of the past just won\u2019t leave you be, but it\u2019s mostly the daylight phantoms of the present that get on your nerves.<br/><br/>The engineer has been hoarding food in between shifts pretending to fix the engine (you\u2019re sure he\u2019s sabotaging it). The biologist keeps herself locked in her room most of the day doing fuck knows what (she\u2019s got to be poisoning the food). The computer-savvy tech keeps the viewscreens lit with porn while he\u2019s running diagnostics on the failing mainframe (can he even get it up?). You\u2019re the doctor. Which one do you euthanize first?<br/><br/>The Needs of the Few is a four-player roleplaying game about people on the brink who have to deal with their haunting pasts and, worst of all, each other.<br/><br/>- Take on one of four roles\u2013The Captain, The Professional, The Victim, and The Positive One\u2013each with their own baggage to deal with (or not deal with) in play<br/> <br/>- Parlor game-like mechanics challenge players to guess each others Secrets, while preserving their own<br/> <br/>- Space maaaaaadnesssss<br/></blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/the-needs-of-the-few/" rel="nofollow">miserytourism.com/the-needs-of-the-few/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384051/#Comment_384051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-01T14:13:06+00:00" title="July  1, 2012  2:13PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nifty!
