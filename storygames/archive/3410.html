The obvious choices that I come up with tend to be Bonds of nightmare, which would seem to make sense for a Monster, but the rules for Bonds say that "If the bond you name is a bond of nightmare, the die you assign it must be a d4," and then the rules for creating a Monster only provide 1d4 in the dice mix for the Monster's Bonds.  <br/><br/>So does that rule for Bonds not apply to the Monster?  Or am I just missing some obvious ideas for dark and terrible Bonds that fall into the categories of Bonds of conscience or tradition?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
