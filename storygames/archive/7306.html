We've just gotten together to play a session of Long Road Nowhere. Each of you brought a themed mix tape with 10-20 songs on it.<br/><br/>We gather some snacks - maybe a bottle of wine, some satay chicken skewers and a fresh baguette. We sit down at the place we game at. I gather the mix tapes and shuffle them, and randomly draw Thor's "Things creeping in the dark parts of the mind".<br/><br/>None of you know the game, but I am going to explain it as we go. I put in the tape, Thor passes a copy of the <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/underground-lyrics-tom-waits.html" rel="nofollow">lyrics</a> of the first song out to everyone at the table, and I hit play.<br/><br/>We play the song in silence, reading along, closing our eyes, or picking at food as the song plays. Let's simulate this now. Everyone in Group Nomad listen to the song in silence.<br/><br/>Based upon that first song and the mix tape title, we decide upon the premise of our road trip. Where are we going? Why? Who's in the car?<br/><br/>We have a casual conversation (without musical accompaniment), and in the end we know: the initial tone, our destination, where we are leaving from, why we are on the road, and vaguely who is in the car (we want very broad brush strokes, like "the crippled grandfather" and "the idealistic poli-sci major" and so on).<br/><br/>So, let's listen to that song and read the lyrics, and then spend the next few days deciding upon our road trip. I'm going to participate in the other group but not in this one. Cheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162345/#Comment_162345" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-12T20:34:07+00:00" title="August 12, 2008  8:34PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds to me like our ride is a real heap.<br/><br/>Look down thru the floorboard holes between your feet, at the grey river of pavement rushing backward<br/>with the buzz of the bald, out-of-balance tires.   Can you hear something worse masked in the din?<br/>Sounds like voices complaining.  The muffler isn't muffling. (Or the radio has been drinking).<br/>The exhaust is leaking up and giving headaches. Or the distributor timing won't hold steady.  Or the camshaft bearings may be flat.<br/>Or there's shrapnel grinding in the gearbox.  Or the compression is shot.  Or the radiator's dry.<br/>Or Or Or.  <br/>And! And! And!, morelike.  <br/>And burnt rubber smells. Acrid battery acid ozone asbestos. Dust.  Stale cigarette smoke.<br/>Wind breathing in the loose door edges. Things creeping in the dark parts of the ride.<br/><br/>Are you with me on this, folks?<br/><br/>Who would be in such a machine?
