                    I'm noticing that the On Dickery thread and the Setting Stakes/Gamism thread have both sort of dovetailed into a discussion of these styles of play, as did the (external) discussion of Push vs. Pull a couple months ago.  Even though it's certainly been worked over in the past, I often feel like the competetive/collaborative split is the elephant in the room in a lot of gaming discussion.<br/><br/>I'm a pretty collaborative player in RPGs and in card/board games, too; I'm much more concerned that everyone has fun than that I win.  I feel like a lot of the Narrative games put me off a bit because they seem to support a competetive style of play better than they support a collaborative style of play; in fact, several such games that I've played have flat-out failed because my group is much more collaborative.<br/><br/>Do you think that's the case?  Which games do you think support which styles, or do you think that any game can be played either way?  And how do you resolve it when you have a mixed group of collaborative/competetive players; through the rules, through social contract, something else?                </div>

<p>I'm not sure I can objectively <em>identify</em> collaborative play as distinct from competitive play.</p>
<p>Yes, it seems very simple.  If they're competing it's competitive, right?  But ... well, suppose two baseball teams get together with the intention of striving to have the best, most exciting, most challenging game they can.</p>
<p>That's an awful lot of collaboration happening right there, y'know?</p>
<p>I think that the reason this is the elephant in the room (and I agree that it often is) is that the words "collaborative" and "competitive" are like movie screens that everyone projects their own personal stuff onto.  If I remove the personal stuff (so as to communicate) I find that there's <em>nothing left</em> for me to say using the terms.</p>

In many threads in their forum, the point is made that anyone roleplay the results-- the primary difference is that the person who drew high card has the final say.

<p>I am not sure that I understand the question. Could you point me at the sort of <em>competitive</em> effects that make the game fail for you in, for instance, The Pool? What about Shadows?</p>
<p>Heck, what do you mean when you say "narrative games"?</p>
<p>I tend to feel like that's a term that's used to refer to "a class of non-traditional games that I don't like", more often than not.</p>

<p>I really think that it's generally for the best if a game (either in it's Platonic form, or as in "a game of Bridge") does best when it's clear whether the ultimate outcome will be that one player wins, and the players are all striving to be the winner, or the ultimate outcome isn't all that important and we're all just trying to have a good time.</p>
<p>For the record, I don't think that the dichotomy there between cooperative/competitive.  Arkham Horror is cooperative, because the players will all win or lose together.  But the game's object is to win.</p>
<p>Obviously, a reason we play games is to have fun, but I think there's a difference between games that present victory as the object and games that present fun as the object.</p>
<p>And I think a large part of the difference is in the system of incentive the game presents.  If the aim is victory, then you want to make plays that will win the game for you, and the game needs to make the moves that are "right" be winning moves.  If the aim is just fun, then fun moves need to be encouraged, and strategic thinking shouldn't be rewarded.</p>

<p>I also do see how you see a competitive spin to certain narrative games.  If nothing else, a lot of narrativist games (and I'm thinking of Mountain Witch in particular, but it's by no means unique in this) reward success by granting narration rights.  Which makes resolution competitive: you're trying to win the right to narrate the results, and that puts you at odds with the other players.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one of the most profound things I've read about role playing (along with "say yes or roll dice") is "if we have fun, we all win," and I really do think that competition can breed some of the best results, in my own not-very-hippy way.</p>

                            I personally think that the two terms competitive and collaborative are skew -- that is, while they are certainly different terms, they are not necessarily opposites of each other.  After all, in a baseball game, the players have to collaborate with their teammates if they want to effectively compete against the other team.  I see a lot of games which reward both collaboration and competition in varying degrees.<br/><br/>Further, classifying people as one or the other is probably an effort in futility.  Do your 'collaborative' friends not like a rousing game of Scrabble/Monopoly/Soccer, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Mister</span> Ms. Pease?                        </div>

                            That's Ms. Pease, actually .  Okay, so obviously what I need to do is tell you all what I mean by competetive and collaborative, and maybe someone has better terms for what I'm talking about, I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
A competetive style is one in which the player wants to win something from the other players; it could be the narrative, it could be surviving where they don't, it could be attention and admiration.  The focus is on setting individual victory conditions and achieving them.<br/>
<br/>
A collaborative style is one in which the player wants the group as a whole to progress together; whether it's finishing the adventure, telling a really good story, or just having fun of an evening.  The focus is on setting an inclusive goal and working towards it.<br/>
<br/>
Now, having written that, the problem is that they often are integrated in roleplaying games.  For example, we might decide as a group that telling a good story is best achieved by individual competition over the narrative.<br/>
<br/>
Grr.  I know what I mean but I'm having trouble articulating it.  Very basically:<br/>
<br/>
Competetive = win, have fun<br/>
Collaborative = have fun, win                        </div>

                            Okay, and about Narrative games (or whatever you'd like me to call them: indie games, story games, whatever): what I mean by that term is a game that uses some kind of mechanic to actually move the story along in a certain direction, rather than simply to resolve in-game conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
I think my problems in the past have been very much what judson suggested, that you must compete with the other players for narrative rights.  I don't like roleplaying games where the players are in competition with one another; I don't mind it if the characters are, if that's what works for the story (although, even then, I tend to shy away from games that are all about inter-character conflict).                        </div>

<br/>
No!  Really.  Don't look at me like that...<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who believe that if EVERYONE is forced to fight and strive to get ahead, that the result is that everyone (even the "losers") are better off than they would have been if they hadn't been fighting and striving.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who believe that the creation of "winners" and "losers" is inherently unfair, especially when the more you win, the more you CAN win, and the more you lose, the harder it is to compete (which is often the case). <br/>
<br/>
Neither of them is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I think that any system that doesn't take both of these worldviews into consideration is inherently flawed.                        </div>

<p>Yeah, I know.  But it's the best analogy I could come up with.</p>
<p>I think, what most RPG's need is a strong commitment to BOTH philosophies.</p>
<p>Yes, make people fight and strive; but make it so that the more you win, the HARDER it is to win the next time, so that the gap between "winning" and "losing" never gets so wide that the loser has no way to contribute, and the winner can dominate.</p>

                            Interesting, and it gels nicely with what I'm working on with Dramatikos.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where peaseblossom is coming from.  While the drama that results from conflict is certainly interesting (I am a playwright, after all), non-stop competition gets exhausting.  Not to mention, if you keep losing to the other players based on personality, experience, or what have you, the competition gets frustrating.  Of course, there are design and gameplay elements that can address this problem (like making sure everyone gets their input, or that the same people don't always get the first and best results simply because they're the loudest, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Some of this internal conflict influenced how I designed Dramatikos.  Overall, I think the short-term elements, like specific conflicts, are more competitive but the long-term elements, like controlling the direction of the plot, rely more heavily on cooperative elements.  It's designed in such a way that in order to compete in the short-term, there needs to be a long-term commitment to cooperation.  In other words, the more you help people have their fun, the more you get to do the things you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be happy to post examples, if you want.                        </div>

                            Exactly.  The best games are those that make cooperation an intrinsic element of competition, and vice-versa.  You need the cooperation of the other players to win, and you need to strive towards a goal to meaningfully interact with the other players.                        </div>

                            I think what you're talking about isn't so much "competition" but the lack of conflicts of interest. If the object of the game is to have a good story come out of it and my job as a player is to push my protag's issues, and your job as GM is to make me question my characters stances, we're not competing.<br/>
<br/>
 We have a dynamic tension that makes a story.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I propose, Shreyas: come up with an algorithm for cooperative play that gives everyone the tools they need to make a good story come out. It doesn't have to be concrete. Just say something like "I give you resources for doing something I like when my character's in the scene" or something.<br/>
<br/>
I think you're talking about potentially fruitful territory, but I want to understand what you're talking about.                        </div>

                            I think that some narrative games (Polaris in particular) encourage collaboration (although this is maybe just my outlook).  In Polaris, you are working together to create a moving, evocative story; so although you have bargaining for the outcomes of certain situations, it's from an external viewpoint and you're arguing for the best story, not necessarily what's best for your character.  Therefore, if you're creating a good story, no one "loses".  Maybe this is a situation unique to Polaris, however, since your character is doomed to death from the beginning, so the player knows the outcome and can revel in tragedy, watching their character fight against the inevitable.<br/>

<p>I think I have one, for one value of "good story." Whisper if you want to see it, as I want to know who's got a copy and who not.</p>
<p>Here's another:</p>
<p>You can narrate your character accomplishing anything you like (within constraints set elsewhere). The other players cannot stop you, but they can specify adversity that delays that accomplishment or occurs as a consequence of it. The other players may also, at arbitrary times, give you resources in exchange for narrating a turn of good fortune. You can use these resources to constrain, but not halt, adversity.</p>

I suspect most of the games can be nudged a slot or two, to match individual/ playgroup preferences.  I've run DitV with very little intra-group conflict, but I've read actual play where people are really jazzed about the system supporting conflicts between PCs.  In Breaking the Ice, the two players are (kindof) competing against the system-- trying to make a good outcome despite obstacles.  Capes, on the other hand, really rewards analyzing other players and targetting what they care about-- if you don't, you'll get much less reward.<br/><br/>A lot of what pushed (in my mind) a game into a category was the primary sphere of conflict.  Cooperative games tend to be against the setting/ enivronment, while Competitive games reward you for getting resources from someone using tactics.                        </div>

Some of you are thinking in terms of a spectrum, and it's not; it's a coordinate plane.<br/>

A game can be BOTH competitive AND cooperative.                        </div>

<p><em>Vaxalon:</em></p>
<pre><code>I think it comes down to capitalism vs. socialism.
</code></pre>
<p>Which reminds me of my favorite commentary on economic systems: "In capitalism, man exploits man.  In socialism, it's the other way around."</p>
<p>And for the extra point:</p>
<pre><code>Whereas I think winning is fun, and having fun leads to the winning       condition for games I play. So ... I don't see why you have to choose to prioritize one over the other, if they can be made the same thing.
</code></pre>
<p>To escape to board games for a second, if you're playing <em>Axis &amp; Allies</em> or <em>Diplomacy,</em> and you're not playing to win, then you really are spoiling the fun of the game.  Because I'm playing to win, and to do that, I'm trying to figure out what you'll do and counter it, at least partially.  If you're just fooling around, then all of my heavy thinking is pointless, and like it or not, you're mocking my efforts.  In order to understand the game, as a player, I need to prioritize winning.  And along the way, we'll have fun.</p>
<p>If we play <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Nanofictionary/Index.html" rel="nofollow">Nanofictionary</a> (which I select as an example because it is <em>even more</em> hippy that OUAT) we have to come to the conscious realization that winning as a priority will ruin the game.  Because really, there is no "best play" that maximizes your chances of winning.  The priority in <em>Nanofictionary</em> is to come up with a fun little story with the restrictions imposed by the cards we have.  And there's a "winner" but getting hung up on winning doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm probably coming across as kind of argumentative, but it's more that I've got this fuzzy idea about how any game, ( role playing, cards, or board) has to align itself with a purpose, and reward play that's runs with the grain that the game is pushing for and not reward play against that grain.  And I do see a lot of examples of rewards that are confusing because they're orthogonal.</p>
<p>Am I making any sense whatsoever here?</p>

<p>Hell, I'd go so far as to suggest that cooperation/competition are neither opposed nor orthogonal.  I think it's very hard to suggest that I could take a hypothetical design and rerstructure it so that I could turn the cooperation dial without the competition dial moving as well, or even that I could predict easily how the two will relate in a particular design.</p>
<p>In fact, the Game Designer's Third Disease (after Theory Wankery and the Orphan Mechanic Syndrome) is Metasystemics: the idea that the critical characteristics of a game can be related to each other in some sort of chart or model.</p>
<p>By way of analogy, who among you would try to place foodstuffs on a Sweet vs. Salty table?</p>
<p>And I think it's also salient that it's entirely reasonable to say, for example, that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Mountain Witch is cooperative in that we win by having fun and telling a kick ass story about the tense interplay between shifty ronin.</p></li>
<li><p>The Mountain Witch is competitive because we game (roll dice and spend points and call for aid) for the rights to narrate, and because ultimately we'll probably have all kinds of betrayal going on, and that works better if I want to win, in terms of accomplishing my Dark Fate and not getting killed and whatever.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And both those statements are true at the same time and not at all contradictory.  In fact, a lot of the cooperative aspects feed on the competitive ones, and vice versa.</p>
<p>(And in terms of design study, I'd point to Colossal Arena, wherein the course of play, one forms tacit alliances with other players.)</p>

                            I feel like you all just kind of ran past the whole collaborative part there. Let me back up a bit:<br/><br/>Take a game like <i>Ars Magica</i>, frex. It's designed with collaboration in mind; sure, you could play it so you're all fighting over magical resources, but that's not how it is in the book, and I don't think that most people play it like that.<br/><br/>It's not that there's no conflict, but the conflict happens within the game, between characters and things in the game world. The players themselves don't engage in any conflict. There's nothing to win.<br/><br/>It's not just that we agree that losing is bad and nobody wants to do it all the time (to paraphrase Tony), it's just that there is no losing and winning.                        </div>

<p>I think this statement only works when you accept the common (and to my mind <em>wrong</em>) assumption that the GM is not a player.  Otherwise it becomes</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>The players only engage in conflict along certain lines:  one player (the GM) against all other players, while all other players combine their resources and effort against the GM.</p>

<p>That strikes me, at least, as a much more interesting way of looking at things.  You?</p>
<p>EDIT:  I could, however, be wrong about what you're saying.  Some times the GM will apply only <em>faux adversity</em> ... i.e. there is competition within the fiction, but the GM is actually just working with all the other players toward the same goal of covenant victory.  Is that what you're arguing for?</p>

                            I don't think "faux adversity" is quite it. The GM has a different set of tools to help boost gameplay, and she can use them in a collaborative or competitive fashion. These tools include introducing adversity into the fiction (even if it's not between the _players_).                        </div>

                            Jess, I think there's a tendency, when people begin to seriously dip their toes into writing about RPG stuff, for folks to try to create meta-categories for various games, players, or play styles.  Ron's GNS is, of course, the most famous example, but there's also Mo's Push-Pull thing, the kind of categories you present here as Collaborative-Competative, and many, many others.<br/>
<br/>
And, as far as I can tell, breaking gaming up into categories is most often a tool for saying "I like play that's more like X and less like Y."  Ron claims that GNS isn't supposed to do this, but part of his position was that there were already games that supported G &amp; S, but not so much ones that supported N, so GNS ended up becoming "Go Narrativism!"  And Mo's Push-Pull thing is similar.  While claiming to not be a judgement on other play styles, Mo herself is clearly "Go Pull!"  Likewise, you seem to obviously be "Go Collaborative!"<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess, I'm struggling with how to best help you out here.  I think dividing gaming into things you really enjoy and things you don't enjoy as much can be incredible helpful.  It focuses your own design goals.  It lets you know what kind of games you should try to be a part of.  It does all sorts of good stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think that categorization can become unhelpful, because categories begin constraining the way you think about things.  Obviously, most play is a combination of collaborative and competative tendencies and you don't necessarily want to do all one or the other.  You want to make the choices that make the most sense for your game, no matter what the meta-categories say.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess, when you say, "Collaborative play is like X and I want to figure out how to support it better," I'm wary of labeling specific games and players, but I'm more than happy to talk about play techniques that I think support the kind of play that you seem to enjoy.  Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            Okay, last things first: yes, Jere and I live together, but I was definitely logged in (both to the computer and to this site) as me.  It' s not a huge deal, but it certainly could get confusing.<br/>
<br/>
Then, back up to the top (relatively speaking): Tony, I agree with Dev that the GM (in games with a GM) can provide adversity through the game that doesn't leak through to become a conflict with the (other) players.  I don't think that the GM (or the other players) has to be working toward covenant victory (whatever that is), but I suppose there does have to be an agreement of covenent survival and the possibility for covenant advancement.  (With the covenent structure, especially, this doesn't necessarily mean any particular character's survivial or advancement.)<br/>
<br/>
Last (but certainly not least), Jonathan: I feel like I was pretty straight in saying, "I like collaborative play and I want to play games that support it," but perhaps I should have said, "I like collaborative play and I like games with stories and I want to play games that support both."  Or, perhaps, "I like to play games where the conflict is internal to the fiction and doesn't bleed into the meta."                        </div>

<p>One thing that's been on my mind about collaboration/competetive play is that I feel a lot of instances of functional/happy competetive play have a lot of collaborative going on still, to a rather high degree.</p>
<p>In my Dogs game, I've found that I absolutely need to take up a competetive tack to best serve my players; but there is still a lot of collaborative so that we're competing over choices they are all invested in, rather than just griefing them. Example: one of the Watchdogs has a demon in his head (it's true!) and he definitely expects me to make this demon challenge him. But, I tried pushing in one way - the demon heckling him into possibly falling down a ravine - and he told me clearly that this wasn't really interesting for him; he wanted his challenge in a different place, and I was mis-serving him by competing there.</p>
<p>So in my experience, these haven't been separate <em>entirely</em>. But I think I see the difference in play that you're talking about. Being responsible for real adversity at the other players an be a wierd role</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Which games do you think support which styles, or do you think that any game can be played either way?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Some rules require more competition than others, but beyond that I think the power of drift is pretty damn strong. From my experiences, Burning Wheel and Sorceror didn't feel dominated by competition, while Dogs requires a lot more of it to be functional.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more general competetive pattern is: (1) Entering and possibly overcoming a conflict is incentivized, and (2) Conflict is triggered when two players disagree about what should be happening next. You then have a situation that, for a player to earn those incentives, he <em>needs</em> his other players to trigger conflict against him.</p>

                            Hey, :)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... somewhere in this discussion, we might want to separate between competitive-vs-collaborative GMing (which is somewhat of a moot point, actually) and competitive-vs-collaborative playing between non-GM players (or in GMless games).<br/>
<br/>
Either that or I'm missing the point entirelly...<br/>

                            Jess, I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're getting at, but I started writing you a response and this just sort of came out of me.  I hope it sorta gets at what you're asking for here.  I apologize if I'm wide of the mark.<br/><br/>There seems to be a large number of unsatisified players who want play that supports a high degree of negotiation and interaction between players but also very little fiddling with meta-mechanics or resources or tactics or the like.  They want some system support but also want to preserve some degree of immersion or don't want to break the fantasy to deal with mechanics or just don't really like fiddling with mechanics.  And most of the Forge stuff and even the non-Forge indie stuff tends to create interesting story conflicts by encouraging inter-player conflicts using mechanics (Universalis, MLwM, and PTA being the clearest models here, but even including stuff like Dogs, Mountain Witch, Polaris, and Breaking the Ice).<br/><br/>And, honestly, a large number of the players interested in high collaborative, low meta-mechanics play seem to be female and on the edge of both mainstream and indie roleplaying (the indie crowd, as different as it is from the mainstream, can still be a boys' club), so their interests aren't really being taken into account by recent design and theory work, unless it's being done by folks like you, Jess, or Mo, or Annie Rush, or Meg Baker, or Emily Care Boss.  <br/><br/>And, while most male designers really respect, enjoy, and want to support the kind of work the indie women are doing, I get the sense that most of the indie crowd aren't really interested in that kind of play or don't think that it's really possible to have some serious system that doesn't require messing with mechanics or fiddling with resources or creating inter-player conflicts through reward systems or whatever.  This seems too much like freeform.  Or like Amber.  But when you drop something like Neel's <i>Lexicon</i> or Shreyas' <i>Mridangam</i> or my <i>KKKKK</i> on them, something that reframes things <span style="text-decoration: underline;">completely differently</span> than other RPGs, they go "Oooo, that's neat," but it becomes a one-time thing, an experiment.  Nobody is picking it up and running with it and really playing in this sandbox yet.<br/><br/>Still, I think the interest in this kind of collaborative, low-impact play, potentially (and once we actually figure out how it really works), is HUGE and I sympathize because I often feel that way and have been trying to get at how to best support play in that style.  Unfortunately, most of what I have to show for it are my <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/02/duets.html" rel="nofollow">2-player experiments</a> and not real solutions yet.  But it's definitely something that I hope to continue working on.<br/><br/>So that's a long response to say, basically, <i>I don't think the style of play you are looking for has really been formalized in a game yet</i>.  There are games that do some of that and there are games in development that will hopefully do a lot more, but I don't think this area has had sufficient attention put to it yet.  I've been trying and so have a few others, but this is not where most people's attention is right now (where is it?  I don't really know).<br/><br/>Maybe you'll be the one to really make it work.                        </div>

<p>I think if we're to productively treat this as a design challenge and not as a black hole, we have to figure out <em>why</em> those fiddly bits (did I miss a portion of the discussion here?) are undesirable, and make fiddly bits that <em>are.</em></p>

                            Does a game need fiddly bits?  I don't have an answer, but I'm seeing assumptions that it does.  These may be right and well thought out.  I'm just asking the question.<br/>
<br/>
I want to play the way Jonathan described.<br/>
<br/>
Undesirable fiddly bits are not in themselves interesting long term.  They may have novelty value the first time, but they don't hold interest.<br/>
<br/>
Or should a discussion of what makes fiddly bits undesirable go elsewhere?                        </div>

                            I was assuming it was from Jonathan's comment:
<blockquote><i>...but also very little fiddling with meta-mechanics or resources or tactics or the like.</i></blockquote>
Which is not necessarily (but maybe in practice?) synonymous with rules.<br/><br/>Personally, meta-mechanics I can usually cope with.  Resource management turns me off big time.  And needing to use tactics to ensure fun makes my skin crawl, because I'm well aware that there'll be lots of days when I want roleplaying fun, but my brain isn't up to tactics.  So that resonated with me.<br/><br/>So to get back to your design question, assuming that there is this group of players who want this thing, that there's enough overlap in what they find fiddly to be useful, is the next step to find out what those fiddly bits are and what aspects of them repel?                        </div>

I find most "Forge" designs to be way too "in your face" mechanically for me to enjoy, and was really put off by the competitive nature and resource management of Universalis (not dissing the game, but that style is not fun for me).                        </div>

                            You know, I think my own game <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> might fit the bill, here, but I'm not sure.  This is one of those interesting things that games do after they've been designed and it turns out that they actually work in ways you weren't aware of.  Back when Mo did her Push/Pull thing, which I still don't understand, I was told that my mechanics had all sorts of Pull to them that I couldn't distinguish from the Push bits.<br/><br/>In any case, FLFS has Atts and Skills which are, really, color.  Success on a die check lets you narrate until you hand off narration to somebody else or somebody else wins a die check.  Everybody has three player-written stats called thematic batteries that they can tap at their discretion to give themselves disadvantages and advantages to those die checks.  You get XP by making reference to other people's thematic batteries.  Every situation you play is based off of the players' thematic batteries and declared expectations for the game.<br/><br/>In play, this seems to default to a pretty freewheeling narration hand-off scheme; I haven't ever seen it get really <em>competitive</em> over who gets to narrate next.  The fiction defaults to very cooperative teams confronting a problem that they are all engaged in, and with everyone constantly referencing and reinforcing each other's characters, it is highly cooperative.                        </div>

                            I'll be a data point, though I don't think I should be the only one.
<blockquote><i>What games work for you, when you're not in tactics mode? Which don't?</i></blockquote>
I haven't played a huge range of games.  This is something I'm working to change.<br/><br/>What works?  Amber DRPG <b>when I'm playing with people who aren't getting all tactical and competitive</b>.  When they are, not so much.  This is probably mostly a game that doesn't get in the way, rather than actually supporting what I want.<br/><br/>I've also played D&amp;D 3.5, which is intermittently fun.  If the group is ok with me not thinking tactically, enjoying the weird things that may happen because I'm not thinking tactically, and willing to put up with me asking stupid questions because I won't pay attention to crunchy bits, then it's fun.  If the group's fun is reduced because I'm not making the best tactical decisions, they have less fun, and I have less fun because of the pressure on me to do something that I don't particularly enjoy or know I will screw up.<br/><br/>The other games I've played have mostly been online where the players don't directly engage with fiddly bits.  Or I've GMed stuff in one shots, so it's hard to see how I'd react as a non-GM.<br/><br/>Given the small range of games I've played for long enough to really comment on, I'm not sure I can be helpful talking at the game level.  Maybe the technical level would be better?
<blockquote><i>And which fiddly bits do you not take exception to?</i></blockquote>
I find it really hard to answer this in a way that doesn't look petty and unhelpful.  But I don't really notice fiddly bits that I don't take exception to.  Like a system that's working well appears seamless, unobtrusive and natural.  I don't notice what's there because it's working.  And that's part of what I want.  I want a system that helps me have a great experience without me coming out of it at the end thinking how much the system helped.  I want to go 'oh wow, wasn't that cool!' and not even think of the system.<br/><br/>Which, now that I think of it, is kind of sucky for a game designer, 'cause what I'm essentially looking for is a game that doesn't make me think what a wonderful designer they are.  I can completely see the greater appeal of designing games for people who want to play a game and come out of it thinking 'oh wow, that was cool, the system helped it to be so cool, that game designer is such a great fellow, I want to bestow all sorts of sexual favours on them!'  I know which has most initial appeal for me.  As a guide leader itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken me years to get to the point of appreciating seeing a girl go through all sorts of personal development and grow as a person without the girl truly being aware of how much I have shaped that.  And I get to see the kids doing this, rather than just hoping it happens out there somewhere.<br/><br/>I quite liked the dice bits in DitV, but I'm not sure I have them down fluidly yet, so that may still be novelty value.  What I like about them is that they seem like they could run in parallel to the narration of the game, rather than being a break in it.  But that requires a fair amount of familiarity with both using the dice and the style of narration that goes along with them.<br/><br/>Josh, Full Light, Full Steam has crossed my radar, and looked interesting enough that if I can find some people willing to give it a go, I'll probably buy it.                        </div>

<p>How does Amber function in that mode?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the whole of its system is, "Convince the GM that your plan is better than the other plan and therefore wins."</p>
<p>That is to say, I feel like I've misphrased the question, and it should have been, "Which <strong>systems</strong> work for you..."</p>

                            I don't usually play Amber with a large amount of conflict between players, so 'wins' doesn't really describe it for me.  The formal system is largely used to define what characters can and can't do.  The informal system is that the GM determines the consequences of the plans, rather than whether they can be achieved.  It is largely freeform in practice.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the answer is that I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t experienced any systems that do work for me, only ones which suck different amounts.                        </div>

                            Sometimes I think I'm at the exact opposite end there of the spectrum; I don't know of a system that DOESN'T work for me because I find whatever flex point.  (Well, I did stop using the SJG <i>In Nomine</i> system...)  Alas, as a GM I want more consequences spelled out.  I'm OK with the Amber-esque "you only fail if you're being opposed," suggestion, but applying so much personality to the conflict I find wearying on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">social</span> level.  That's why I side to collaborative as a GM: I am excited to be <i>with</i> the players, finding a solution to the puzzle <b>I</b> indicated as existing.  As a player, on the other hand, I despise solving things. I'd rather deal with the social aspects of why that puzzle was there, and what it means overall to the culture of the puzzle-solvers, and...because solving puzzles seems to me too much like a competition.<br/><br/>(I like the tactics.  I like the bureaucracy.  Why do I keep running things like "Over the Edge"? [shakes head])                        </div>

<blockquote>I'm a pretty collaborative player in RPGs and in card/board games, too; I'm much more concerned that everyone has fun than that I win. I feel like a lot of the Narrative games put me off a bit because they seem to support a competetive style of play better than they support a collaborative style of play; in fact, several such games that I've played have flat-out failed because my group is much more collaborative.</blockquote>
I come from a wargaming background where my father, who introduced me to wargaming, was minimally forgiving in teaching me the ropes.  As such, I see conflict and competition as being key in making a good session.  Certainly any game where narrative control is a matter of success over other players is encouraging comeptition - but I don't see that as a bad thing.  A level of tension <i>between players</i> as well as between the characters is key to making for dynamic play.<br/><br/>Of course it can spin out of control, and that's where the social resources of the group come into play - any instance where social capital is spent outside of the gamespace is a matter of social contract.  I'd need to observe your group in action, of course, and I'd like to ask what kinds of games you play, but I'd also be surprised if your group was as completely collaborative as you think it is.                        </div>

                            (likewise!)<br/>See, and I don't think that a level of tension between players is at all necessary for dynamic play.  I mean, yes, there needs to be investment in what's going on, but that's not the same thing as conflict or tension.<br/><br/>Jonathan:<br/>Hm.  I think that what I'm talking about (specifically in reference to collaboration) <i>has</i> been formalized in many games: many of the traditional rpg 'what is an rpg?' sections explicitly state 'nobody wins an rpg', for example; however, they don't necessarily support other things that I'm looking for in a game.<br/><br/>I'm a bit weirded out by your making it a gender thing, not only because I'm hopelessly outnumbered on that front, but also because saying something like 'girls don't like games with mechanics' comes awful close to saying 'girls don't like math'.  I mean, I get what you mean and I'm not offended by you, but I get worried that others might take that ball and run with in unsavory directions with it.<br/><br/>Beyond those points, though, hrm.  I'm'a have to think a little more and get back to you.                        </div>

                            Jess, I think many, many people have mistaken the desire for low-impact mechanics with "Barbie says: Math is hard" and been really barking up the wrong tree, so I understand you being weirded-out.
