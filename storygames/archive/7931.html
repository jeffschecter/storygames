I have come to realise that I know precious little about how the gaming community actually makes use of wikis as a resource.<br/><br/>Yes, there are the obvious things like the SG Codex, the very extensive Spione Wiki and many, many others. However, I'd be really interested to know how individuals actual use wikis as a tool or resource for their gaming. And if you don't use them, why not?

I should really link to them somewhere.  When we set up the game I created a new blog to discuss issues that came out of the game and to post AP reports.  I know my players are constant bloggers so I needed somewhere to rebut them...:)<br/><br/>The game setting and situation initially came from all of us during a couple of afternoons bored at work and was detailed on our gaming message board.  I initially transferred that material to the blog intending to use it as the central information resource.  As the amount of material increased it became obvious that was not going to work so I moved everything to the Wiki.  <br/><br/>The Wiki now contains the material we generated prior to starting the game.  I also include details of the characters.  As the game has progressed I have added the background and situation material which have come from the AP.  I do it for various reasons.  My handwriting is a terrible scrawl so I need an accurate record.  As I add things it sparks ideas for new stuff.  I get to add a load of atmospheric art which sets the theme and tone of the game.  It allows me to add additional bits to the material which the players may have missed during the game or which may not have been obvious at the time. <br/><br/>While the players can and do introduce new stuff in the game I tend to be the one who records it on the Wiki.  While I would be fine with them adding material I get the sense that there is a reluctance to do so mid game. We are playing 4e and the way the game is set up we draw heavily on the idea of the different tiers.  The material for the heroic tier was written predominantly by the players (and one non player - hello Ben!).  The players have then trusted me to run with what they provide.  <br/><br/>As we hit the Paragon Tier I expect that we will redo the game situation and see a lot more setting material being written.  At that time I expect the players should begin adding significantly to the Wiki (although they wont, I will get a bunch of stuff on our board which I then have to transpose, honestly, whats a lazy GM got to do to get the players to do ALL of the work - hello Neil!).  <br/><br/>Links for the interested:<br/><br/><a href="http://aw4e.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://aw4e.blogspot.com/</a><br/><a href="http://thecityofkings.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thecityofkings.wikispaces.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175530/#Comment_175530" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T06:00:47+00:00" title="October 20, 2008  6:00AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I use the wikis associated with Camarilla games extensively, especially that for the Changeling game.

The fact that you all know what is going on on precludes the necessity for such a thing? That provides an interesting comparison between your experience and the experience that Andrew and his group has.

Our buy-in is pretty good, though the one guy who set up the wiki does the lions' share of the session transcription and the rest of us edit as necessary.<br/><br/>Our wikis are nothing special, just semi-formalized notekeeping spaces.  We don't do game critique or troubleshooting or anything high-minded there.   The AP reports concern themselves only with the fiction and probably aren't terribly interesting to anyone but us.  That said, the D&amp;D4 one has been really useful to me (I'm the DM) for preplay session preparation.  And in-play, I reference the pages for the individual NPCs to help me get into their mindspace.<br/><br/>Couple other thoughts:<br/><br/>Our D&amp;D4 is a DM-led game--I know the plot, and the PCs are discovering it.  It's totally fascinating to see the notekeeper's take on the fiction.  It's like looking through a warped mirror at my own notes, and I've adjusted the story a couple times to better conform with the wiki. <br/><br/>Also, hyperlinks = relationship map.  The Golden Age Mutants and Masterminds campaign is just getting underway now (first session tomorrow woot!)  Our characters are filtering in, and it's been neat to see the GM migrating NPCs from my background onto the Significant NPC list, and I've also been editing my guy to reference some of the other NPCs he's listed.

But are wikis really a burden?  I'd say no overall.  There is a maintenance challenge and your group (and you) must BE engaged enough to contribute, reference and improve.  However, personally... I don't enjoy playing in games or with groups not willing to make a little effort.  and really - in the big scheme the effort is small.<br/><br/>I've been using wikis for several years now...  I was (unusual for me) an early adopter for this technology.  I took to wikis right away and have used various sources.  I have moved to keep about 95% of my game work/prep on campaign wikis now...  any notes I create go directly on one of my wikis whether that be private or public for the group.  <br/>I have adopted wiki use as my "campaign bible"... the classic GM notebook type thing we all keep our notes in.  I am almost paperless at this point in my note keeping.  I still tend to print notes (from the wiki) for face-to-face table-top games (I don't really enjoy any online gaming).  <br/><br/>I've used Yahoo Groups (and other listserves) for campaign group connections for nearly 10 years now, and I'm horribly anal about asking players to "check in" to be positive everyone's planning to make it to game weekly...  With that my gamer friends have gotten used to interacting online better.<br/>So naturally when I started using wikis alot, they followed (some kicking and screaming)...  HOWEVER, as with most things IF you really take the leadership and drive the medium and the EFFORT you can bond your group into wiki use for campaigns with easy.  <br/><br/><br/>So... what do I use my wikis for?<br/>Everything.  But that's easy to say so here are some primary uses:<br/><br/>-  home page... noting what the campaign is about, etc... many times I'll list any special character creation stuff here.  This has helped many times if/when a new player joins the group, I can just point them to the character creations notes to remind myself anything special we did...<br/>-  private GM notes, organized exactly like I would my handwritten or word doc notes (but they're available to me anywhere!)<br/>-  experience point and/or equipment/treasure trackers, depending on the game I'll note any xp or other awards and send ONLY the link to the players... so if they want to see the xp, etc... they MUST look on the wiki (evil, I know)<br/>-  game recaps (actual play notes)... I'm not one for doing alot of story form recaps but I tend to do a very short recap on every session somehow...  I like this because it's fun to reference (for any player) months after, even if a game collapses...<br/>-  NPC people/places/things lists and pages... some NPCs merit their own wiki page, some only need noted in list form.  you can get lots of ideas (formatting and otherwise) looking at Wikipedia's pages for TV characters, individuals, locations, etc...<br/>-  timeline... again Wikipedia is a neat source to help ideas for this (or flat out copy/pasting when it's a historical game), updating the timeline with current adventure notes (forming a different style of story recap) is fun...<br/>-  house rules and rule notes.... one great use if you're making new rules for a game or creating house rules or even special stat blocks, etc... you can post them and that way EVERYONE in the group has access to them.  So many times in the past the GM would make up a house rule and then we'd forget what it was, etc...  this is a good source to keep a balanced play field.<br/>-  props and maps....  I try to upload images of maps and/or props I make to the wiki for all to reference between games, its cool to look back on this later...<br/>-  clues... this one's harder but I've made easter eggs for clues on my wikis, slipping in hints and such.  Now and then its AWESOME for a player to ask "hey I say this on the wiki, what..."  and I get to tell them "good job!!"  that's an in-game clue!<br/>-  bluebooking... I've had unbelievable success with the old-school bluebooking on at least one of my wiki campaign bibles. creating an average of 2-3 bluebooks from every player between our (weekly!) sessions... quite exciting...<br/>-  many wikis allow uploading of character sheets in PDF, word or excel docs.  I made a rule with any campaign I have that players MUST upload updated PC sheets to our wiki (or yahoo group) prior to games when they're "leveled up" or whatever.  If they don't, then they're not allowed to play their new updated character...  it's harsh but it works.  This is also helpful BECAUSE the NEED for doing this is highly reinfoced when the first player forgets their character sheet at home.  Problem SOLVED when we simply download and print.  YAY!!<br/>-  and the BEST use... Player Character bios.  This is great for use especially if the players help (or do all) of the work...  it's the primary place I ask for player involvement.  I generally am open to players helping with other stuff (like game recaps, etc..)  but I really try to make their PC page have ownership...  I usually will set up the format of the page with any special campaign questions I want the PC to answer.  I usually suggest a format to upload pictures to use for their character, etc...  I also love to see players create or use the wiki for journals or other notes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175645/#Comment_175645" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-20T23:07:42+00:00" title="October 20, 2008 11:07PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -continued-<br/><br/>Overall I have asked that players USE the wiki, noting (at times) that if it's not on the wiki your PC doesn't have it  (for equipment, etc...)...<br/><br/><br/>So... as you can see... Effort does equal success.  Even in a face-to-face table top group.  <br/>But again, you really REALLY must be the leader and make the effort.  I'm lucky though.  I both type fast and have been trained as a graphic designer, so creating descent looking wiki sites and keeping them updated has been fairly easy.  But it IS still effort.<br/><br/>Though - as I tell all my players.  I DONOT expect them to "work" on the campaign.  If it's not fun.  I DONOT want them to feel as though they must update the wiki weekly.  Same goes for me.  If I'm not enjoying it, then I'm not doing it...<br/>But I enjoy my hobby enough to make an hour or three between sessions.<br/><br/>Not everyone is willing to give that time.<br/>And that's fine.<br/>But I feel that use and creation of a wiki is no more than the effort you'd take for normal campaign GM notes or campaign bible.<br/><br/><br/>I can note some of my wikis if people would find that useful.  I've listed a few in other threads before.  One of my favorites was my "My Life with The Batman"  that was made for a short-term playtest game for MLWM.<br/><br/>hope that helps.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175654/#Comment_175654" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T03:15:26+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  3:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2008 3:47AM by Carl.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used static web pages for my 2001-2003 D&amp;D3e <a href="http://www.flick.com/~cdr/dnd/" rel="nofollow">Babes in the Woods</a> campaign, but I've started a wiki for my new <a href="http://quimon.wikidot.com/" rel="nofollow">Quincy Monsters</a> and Other Childish Things campaign, to track characters (both P and NP) and experience, provide background info, and hopefully enough of a log of what happens for useful reincorporation.
