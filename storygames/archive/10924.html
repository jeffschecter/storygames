And I've been devouring them over the last month (Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, Nightmare on Elm Street, Behind The Mask, I Know What You Did Last Summer). And about a week before Halloween, I got inspired and wrote a game.<br/><br/>It's called Slashed to Ribbons, and it's available <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/ribbon-drive/slashed-to-ribbons/" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. It's written assuming you already know how to play Ribbon Drive, the same as the other hack I wrote, Radion-Accelerator Drive (my Firefly-via-Ribbon-Drive game).<br/><br/>Enjoy!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
