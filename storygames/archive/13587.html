Less than half my printed collection has been played, and most of it just once or twice.<br/><br/>So, I decided to stop buying new games. Or at least slow down. <br/><br/>I figure, if I keep the number of games on my shelf small, keep the rest in a box in a closet, and rotate the titles whenever it starts looking stale instead of buying something new, I might be better at resisting the consumerist urge...<br/><br/>So, what's on my shelf these days? I'm down to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">twelve</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">nine</span> <b>three</b> games! Just keeping a handful of games there that I'm likely to play in the near future and perhaps trigger curiosity from the casual board gaming crowd that comes around.<br/><br/>The finalists  are :<br/><br/>Hero's Banner and Shock: Social Science-Fiction : Two games I love, have some experience with, but have yet to try with my non-gamer friends and/or flatmates (I have so far tried Capes and Inspectres, with mixed results due to inexperience of the other players and miscommunication of the participants expectations.)<br/><br/>A Thousand and One Night : I never played that one, but the rules are simple, and it would be a nice excuse for me and my friends to dress up as the Sultan's courtiers. Since several have a background in theatre, I think it's a strong selling point.<br/><br/>Are you subject to the same consumerist urges? What are you doing to fight them, if anything? If you had to restrict your library shelf to a handful of games at a time, what game would find themselves there right now?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306988/#Comment_306988" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-05T14:25:05+00:00" title="January  5, 2011  2:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am certainly an addict when it comes to buying games. I have one wall in my basement that is entirely filled with RPGs, with quite a bit of overflow, and a stack of gamish board games (Arkham Horror, etc.) more than 6 feet tall. That doesn't include my collection of regular board games, which fills my linen closet.<br/>...and this was AFTER culling my collection when I had moved into my new home. Easily, I have over 500 individual game books (maybe 75 to 100 different systems?), and I'm not sure how many PDFs (not to mention the print-outs of those PDFs).<br/><br/>There have been only two things that have made my purchasing habit trickle down to a one-book-a-month level: I have been avoiding systems that cost far too much, such as Warhammer 3E, or games that have too many specialized components for me to keep track of, such as...well...Warhammer 3E; also, my spending power has been incredibly diminished lately, what with property taxes, household bills, and the upcoming federal and state income taxes looming. Otherwise, I'm still steadily collecting freebie games and knick-knack games here and there (picked up two so far this week).<br/><br/>As for restricting my library of games, there are only a few systems that I'd have out in the open, ready for play: Dungeonslayers, DangerPatrol, Cold War/Hot War, Minions Inc./Apocalypse World, Star Wars (WEG edition), Warhammer 2E, Call of Cthulhu, and either TOON or Teenagers from Outer Space. I'd of course still have a stockpile of other games hiding somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307069/#Comment_307069" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T06:10:17+00:00" title="January  6, 2011  6:10AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2011 6:10AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jumanji83</cite>Are you subject to the same consumerist urges?

I couldn't justify buying any more games if my only arguments were "I want it" or "it has a unique play experience." All that said, the single biggest motivation for me to purchase a game would be a guarantee that I'd have folks to play it (as long as it's not D&amp;D; 4E).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played almost every game I own, at least once... but, yeah, there's maybe a dozen that I own and have read, but have never played, even at a con or in a demo. Include card and board games, and that number goes up a bit more--I have another half dozen or so that I bought mainly via charity auctions at cons, where I'm mainly spending to donate (I often bid against myself, if I think I'm getting something too cheaply... and to shame others into bringing up the average sell values). I see every such purchase as FAR AND AWAY a better investment than the beer I'm likely to spend it on otherwise. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I *never* cull gaming stuff, ever, never. I have every OD&amp;D; module I ever bought (and all the books, of course, including Survival Guides). I've got old CityTech box, original Illuminati... I think the only things I've lost over the years were the original Top Secret box, James Bond RPG box and a few boxed modules, original Gamma World box, and Gangbusters. Best I can figure, I must have left them at my Mom's and they got given to the Salvation Army...?<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing forward with my consumerism:<br/>\n* Mouse Guard Boxed Set - MUST buy, if only for the dice! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>\n* Killer Bunnies Red - I won the base set, Yellow, and Purple in a con auction... but you need Red to use Yellow or Purple! Wonder if I'll ever play it....<br/>\n* Are You The Traitor? - Been meaning to get this party game from Looney Labs for a while, but its price point is JUST high enough to  keep being postponed.<br/>\n* Fiasco Companion - See first paragraph: love to support BPG; easy as hell to get a Fiasco game to make at cons or pick-up games.<br/>\n* Mechaton Revised (if it ever happens) - See first paragraph. Also: Legos (another consumerist urge--show me a set with a per-piece price of 5\xa2 or less and I almost HAVE to buy it, like a moral imperative!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307117/#Comment_307117" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-06T11:40:07+00:00" title="January  6, 2011 11:40AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jumanji83</cite>Are you subject to the same consumerist urges?

I buy lots of games, often on the spur of the moment. Sometimes I forgot I even bought them. I buy stuff out of curiosity a lot of the time.<br><br>I don't really fight it, I think. We've got a fairly good income; we've got fairly high expenses (three kids, two cars, house, insurance). Buying a game or two a month isn't a big deal at all, especially if I compare it to other hobbies people have. Nor do they make much of a dent on the environment. Nor are they bad for me or anyone else. There's just really no reason, except for ascetisism, to stop buying games. <br><br>If I had to throw out all my games and only keep a few, I'd probably keep one copy of each of my own games, because I want to have an archive. If I could keep other people's games as well, hm, I'd keep... these are the first I can think of...<br>- A Taste for Murder. It's a good read. I probably don't really need the rules to play, though, so I might give it away.<br>- Sorcerer and its companion volumes. I love Ron's writing. I might never play this game again, but it's inspirational as hell.<br>- S/Lay W/Me. High replay value, can't remember all the rules/important text, so I'd need the book.<br>- Itras By. Very good writing. High personal value. <br><br>Some games I love I wouldn't need to keep. I know the rules for PTA, for instance. I know the Fiasco rules, and there's lots of playsets on the Internet. (That reminds me: I don't actually have the book!

Especially Zombieporno, Society of Dreamers and Draug. <br/><br/>At this point, I don't really feel I <i>need</i> to own any games. So I mainly cling on to the books for nostalgic value. I'm curious as to why I can't find a copy of PTA on the shelf, though.

In the last two years, I've probably cut my collection by 60-70% and it's still not enough to eliminate the stacks from on top of the shelf. My purchases have slowed to a trickle, but my purging has as well, so I need to cull the systems that I've never played, or am not likely to play again. Games like Fading Suns that I haven't played in a decade, or LUG Star Trek that I've never played (curse you, Half Price Books clearance section!) are what I'm eying for the choping block next.

I apply it to everything in my house, but mostly to books, because that's the bulk of what I own (thanks in no small part to having worked in several book/comic/gaming stores). In fact, I've gotten rid of over 60 boxes of books since I started the purging and now have a standing rule that if anything comes into the house, something has to go out. Keeps clutter at a minimum and since I downsized apartments last year I have less space to work with anyway.<br/><br/>The RPG weeding was a tough slog, but I eventually instituted some tough love and ended up keeping the stuff I was reasonably sure I'd play at some point or had rules-sets I was particularly enamored of. Here's the list:<br/><br/>- All of the <b>Midnight</b> books and supplements. This is my favourite RPG setting ever, bar none, and even though I hate d20, I think it would probably adapt quite nicely to Burning Wheel or something similar. Now it's just a matter of finding a group that wants to commit to playing a long-term serious campaign in (what is essentially) Middle Earth 100 years after Sauron won.<br/>- <b>Amber Diceless</b> &amp; <b>Shadow Knight</b>. One of my favourite systems. I love the way that player/character rivalries are set up during the character creation auction.<br/>- All my <b>Planescape</b> books. My second favourite setting ever.<br/>- <b>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire</b> core book &amp; campaign guide. I love the novels; I love the setting; I just wish it wasn't so intensely rules-heavy. I'll figure out some way to hack it eventually.<br/>- Two full feet worth of <b>WFRP1</b> books. I admit in a lot of ways this is pure nostalgia, seeing as it was one of the first really intense roleplaying experiences I had, but I can't help loving it and I'll never get rid of them.<br/>- Six or seven random <b>Exalted</b> books, which I'm keeping for the fluff.<br/>- The <b>Paranoia 2E</b> box set, which is full to bursting with modules and supplements.<br/>- <b>Iron Kingdoms</b> Character Guide &amp; World Guide. I understand from a business perspective why Privateer killed their RPG line in favour of Warmachine, but I'm not gonna pretend I didn't weep a little when it happened.<br/>- <b>Call of Cthulhu</b> 6E HC.<br/>- <b>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</b>.<br/>- <b>The Nocturnals</b> supplement for M&amp;M. (I love Dan Brereton a lot.)<br/>- <b>3:16</b>.<br/>- <b>Fiasco</b>.<br/>- <b>Apocalypse World</b>.<br/>- <b>Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition</b>.<br/>- All of <b>Burning Wheel</b>.<br/>- <b>Agon</b>.<br/>- <b>The Armory's 30 Sided Dice Gaming Tables</b>.<br/><br/>I also buy PDFs, but I'm not gonna include them--they don't take up space. I don't really buy RPGs from any of the big guns anymore, but I don't have a problem shelling out for the indies. I guess my consumerist urges still hit me in that regard, but as an independent writer I understand the importance of having people support your work.

However, there seemed to be less angst about. Heck, there's even a great deal of humor about ( see various Larry Leadhead comics for examples).<br/><br/>Part of what I suspect works for those guys is that they've really changed ( or simply hae a different) idealized version of what gaming is.<br/><br/>For example, they had a regular once per month club meetup, kinda like a Minicon. In addition they'd have a couple of bigger local cons they'd go to where they'd put together a presentation scenario. In between, they'd hae occasional more casual meetups, where someone would basically host a presentation game.<br/><br/>Not everybody did all of those things, but the presentation games projects between other meetups bcame items for individuals to work on and have fun with.<br/><br/>Some of these guys really put lots of time money and effort into this stuff, for things that only might be played a couple of times. But it was a happy thing,  not a bummer, the way a big collection of unplayed or only slightly played RPGs seems to be for a lot of us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309394/#Comment_309394" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T16:41:08+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  4:41PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought Perfect, Unrevised as a "this is my last RPG for a year" purchase.
