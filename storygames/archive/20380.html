The session came and went, with mixed success, but I'm still interested in comments. I might post about the session later.)<br/><br/>Looks like we'll be returning to the village of Tywyn (and beyond!) this weekend, after a longer pause than I would've liked, so I'm looking for comments on my setup, to shake it out in my mind by writing it all down, and freshen it up with your input.<br/><br/>For reference, I posted in detail about the first two sessions <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?679324-necro-OSR-Beyond-the-Wall-and-Other-Stories-looks-brilliant&amp;p=18996162#post18996162" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?760923-Starting-a-second-adventure-Beyond-the-Wall&amp;p=19184119#post19184119" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>We went through the group sandbox generation process from Further Afield, so Tywyn is surrounded by:<br/><br/>* a ruined wizard's tower where the self-taught mage and the young woodsman had sealed the demon in character generation<br/>* a settlement of twigmen who live in bird cages, and kidnap people and plant twigmen-saplings in them to feed on their blood<br/>* a circle of standing stones where <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Black_Sun.svg" rel="nofollow">branded</a> northern raiders gather to perform unknown rites of power<br/>* an everburning tree which is a portal to Muspelheim for anyone who can survive the flames, or whose honour protects him from the flames<br/>* Lutetia, the capital, ruled by High King Kerwin and Queen Angharad, and protected by the brave knights of Celidon<br/>* Pembroke, a the next village over, perfectly normal, but stuff taken out (say, bought produce) always turns out to be spoiled or malformed<br/><br/>This is all in the land of Celidon. To the north is Lochlann, where the <a href="http://www.grimnir.ch/Bilder/307165_2551373589557_1410392111_32982154_1560206505_n.jpg" rel="nofollow">raiders</a> come from.<br/><br/>Before the heroes' grandfathers were yet grandfathers, King Urt and Skyld Skjaldabrjotr (Shieldbreaker), fought seven days and nights without rest, so long that the fight took them to the heavens. King Urt cast Skyld down from the sky back to Lochlann, the Lochlannach raiders retreated, and King Urt became the first High King of Celidon, and with the help of dwarven masons and miners, built Lutetia.<br/><br/>The heroes just spent an unusually mild winter enjoying their everyday lives in Tywyn, after their adventure with the angered fae. Come campaigning season, High King Kerwin and his knights will ride out in force to cast out the northern raiders... but!<br/><br/><a href="http://img08.deviantart.net/d03d/i/2013/111/d/5/odin_by_unripehamadryad-d62j18b.jpg" rel="nofollow">Grimnir the Grey</a>, a Lochlannach sky-priest is encamped with his men at the standing stones, harnessing their power to summon a fimbulwinter over Celidon.<br/><br/>The King's force, caught unprepared, will stop to resupply at Pembroke, but any food they take will turn out spoiled at the most inopportune moment, the Lochlannach, at home in the snows, will attack the tired and hungry knights, and the might of Lutetia will be broken.<br/><br/>The communities all over Celidon, including the heroes' home village of Tywyn, will suffer terribly from famine, and be left defenseless against the northerners.<br/><br/>The heroes' will first need to take care of the food supply for Tywyn. They actually have a way to pretty much obviate the issue: a bowl from which a mouthful is as nourishing as a full meal. I'm OK with that; they've earned it.<br/><br/>The first time out in the wild, hunting or foraging or investigating the unnatural winter, the heroes will have a vision of <a href="http://www.shadowscapes.com/picts_images/1044.jpg" rel="nofollow">the White Hart</a>, the spirit animal protector of Celidon. It will be pursued by wolves, but will stop to bite the single tasty shiny apple in the winter landscape, which will turn to decay as the wolves catch up on it. The hart might have a burning tree between its antlers: no specific symbolism intended, just to vaguely tie in the Muspel-tree and psychedelize the imagery a bit. There might be <a href="http://frankzumbach.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/ccf12042010_00024.jpg" rel="nofollow">Atlantean ruins</a> involved; the self-taught mage's spellbook comes from the sunken kingdom.<br/><br/>Pembroke's condition is a fairy deal/blessing/curse type of thing: several generations ago, Peredur of Pembroke made a deal with the fae that for as long as one of his line remains in Pembroke, anything born of the field, or of the beast, or of the woman in Pembroke will be hale and strong... the operative words being <i>in Pembroke</i>. Anything taken out decays and degrades. The villagers probably can't really conceive of this, as a part of the curse. So Pembroke is relatively well off on its own, but it's isolated and dying out, because the nearby folk are (rightly) suspicious: people who leave Pembroke tend to sicken and die, so who would want to marry into it?<br/><br/>Grimnir's shieldmaiden daughter <a href="http://40.media.tumblr.com/c355052e9023fabd0c137c87e90c8b19/tumblr_n9sc0lBRAW1r099b1o1_500.jpg" rel="nofollow">Grimhilde</a> has been visiting Pembroke lately in the shape of a falcon. She is in love with Peredur's great-grandson Peren, a villager she met probably by chance while scouting, or something like that. The falcon thing isn't a regular spell or a special skill of hers, it's being in love.<br/><br/>What Grimnir and Grimhilde are really after is more than conquest: they're looking for Skyld Skjaldabrjotr's fabled sword, which fell like lightning from the sky during his fight with Urt. Naturally, that happens to be the abandoned, but alluring blade, glittering in a lightning-cleft rowan tree found by the young woodsman PC in character generation. It's a greatsword, but was probably just a regular sword for Skyld, who must've been a giant compared to men of now. I'm using the "shatter shield to block one attack" rule, but the sword will shatter shields <i>without</i> the attack being blocked. The Lochlannach will recognize it, if not by sight, then when it manifests its power.<br/><br/>The raiders will have some berserkers among them, which can turn into actual bears. This is probably another power of the standing stones, not inherent to the raiders, so if the heroes manage to drive Grimnir away from the stones, they could conceivably harness the power for themselves somehow.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to do here is paint a charged, evocative situation, with interconnected issues, and with NPCs I know and understand, and push the PCs into the middle of it, so I can run the game without pre-planning specific scenes or solutions.<br/><br/>What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448880/#Comment_448880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-04T19:29:33+00:00" title="October  4, 2015  7:29PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a lot of really juicy stuff in there.

It's inspired by Chronicles of Prydain and Ursula Le Guin-like young adult fantasy.<br/><br/>"Further Afield" is a supplement for it that includes a procedure for collaboratively stocking a sandbox with places/things that your young band of PCs have seen, heard rumors of, or read about (along with a method for checking the accuracy of their knowledge). The method is easily adaptable to other games - I recently used a slight variation to build a regional map for an upcoming RuneQuest campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448882/#Comment_448882" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-05T01:57:47+00:00" title="October  5, 2015  1:57AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I really want to play in your campaign!

Cha for an hour after you do something selfless for a stranger or an enemy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the player's approach is ill-suited for what I want from Beyond the Wall, and a lot of time, and more importantly, enthusiasm, was spent in discussions like "wait wait wait, if a shield can stop any one blow outright, I'm going to buy a dozen shields and..."<br/><br/>The irony is, I offered to run either Beyond the Wall or one of Lamentation of the Flame Princess's murder dungeons, and he was the most vocal proponent of Beyond the Wall.<br/><br/>Still, interesting stuff happened.<br/><br/>There was the vision, but it wasn't interpreted in enough depth to prevent the defeat of the High King's host.<br/><br/>The heroes visited Pembroke, didn't poke around quite hard enough to get into what's happening, but did notice a falcon entering and leaving one of the houses by night.<br/><br/>They met the defeated army and convinced them that the spoiling of the food from Pembroke was the result of a curse, and not treason.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the heroes' plan was to visit the standing stones and see whether the winter was being created from there.<br/><br/>On the way, they winged and captured the falcon! Thinking it was a messenger for a Lochlannach spy in Pembroke, the self-taught mage used Arcane Experiment to try and get its message and got... "Peren, my love!" That seemed to have been pretty confusing!<br/><br/>The players were insistent on trying the "one cry for yes, two cries for no" method. That compromised my vision somewhat: originally, the falcon was not so much Grimhilde, acting as Grimhilde, transformed into the shape of a falcon; the falcon is more Grimhilde's infatuation and drive trapping her inside, carrying her to Peren.<br/><br/>But it seemed that players wanted to engage with the situation and find out what's going on so I let it work. Ultimately, I wonder whether it was worth it, since the situation is too tangled up to be laid out in yes/no questions:<br/><br/>Heroes: "Were you going to Peren?"<br/>Falcon-Grimhilde: "Yes."<br/>Heroes: "Is he working with the Lochlannach?"<br/>Falcon-Grimhilde: "No."<br/>Heroes: "Are you working with the Loclhannach?"<br/>Falcon-Grimhilde: "Yes."<br/>Heroes: "???"<br/><br/>And the whole engineering approach of narrowing down the solution space by halves was, again, more suitable for a LotFP deathrap than a BtW fairy tale. I probably should've worked in something like speaking only when the sun is neither in the sky nor below the earth, so only a couple of minutes of discussion each day, right in the moments the sun is bisected by the horizon. It didn't occur to me at the moment.<br/><br/>To top it all off, the next Lochlannach scouting party beat all the heroes into negative hp. I didn't specifically plan this, but I had considered the possibility, and was treating the fights as a "victory: progress vs. complication: capture" branching point rather than a "victory: progress vs. failure: game over" gate, but I didn't stress that in advance, it was getting late, that last-man-standing-but-hey-maybe-I-roll-six-20s-in-a-row fatalism was setting in, and the whole atmosphere had swung from play to find what happens to play to win a lot more than in previous sessions, so the capture had the flat taste of scrambling to retcon an inadvertent TPK.<br/><br/>The irony is, I would love to play the Cha 14 Untested Thief who gets +4 Cha when he does selfless things for enemies and +2 when Begging, in this situation! This is the stuff fairy tales are made of: the happy-go-lucky beggar who's nice even to his scary foreign barbarian captors, and manages to sweet talk them into, well, anything he wants.<br/><br/>But I fear the opportunity will be wasted on the player playing the thief: his comments on the soles' magic alternated between cynically observing that he can get the bonus at any time by helping some irrelevant NPC do something irrelevant, and disappointedly contrasting the requirement of doing something for an enemy and therefore being faced with one with the bonus which cannot be directly leveraged to destroy an enemy.<br/><br/>All in all, I regret not running Lamentations of the Flame Princess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448886/#Comment_448886" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-05T20:32:51+00:00" title="October  5, 2015  8:32PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very interesting.

I was super excited by the IDEAS and UTTERLY and completely let down by the rules. <br/><br/>IMHO, their decision to make the game based on an OSR chassis is a serious, serious misstep.  The only reason I can fathom for this decision is that the game is supposed to be "fast to get going in" and OSR is "fast to get going in...for people who've already played a D&amp;D type game."  And unfortunately, I don't think that's even that big of a win.<br/><br/>The game is full of clever ideas and the chargen stuff is pretty cool, but the actual game rules made me want to hit my head on the desk.  It was kindof heartbreaking. I really wanted to like it. The inspirational material is so close to my heart, but the game itself is so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448913/#Comment_448913" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T14:54:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  2:54PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How easy would it be to use the character background/plot hook creation stuff from BtW to generate ideas for some other game?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448916/#Comment_448916" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T15:59:08+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  3:59PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2015 3:59PM by shimrod.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very easy.<br/><br/>The character generation is a bunch of tables for the PC's childhood, connections in the village, how they came into their heroic prowess, with entries like "you were taught chess by the village elder, get +1 Dex, +1 Int, and add the village elder to the roster of NPCs".<br/><br/>The scenarios are bunch of tables with questions like "what angered the Fae?", "who rules the Fae?", "what odd custom is observed in the Fae court?", with entries like "an undiscovered murder", "a kindly ogre", "all promises are utterly binding" (respectively).<br/><br/>The scenarios are pretty much system-neutral, and it'd be easy enough to ignore the D&amp;D stat part of the character generation tables, and just use them as a source of history and ties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448921/#Comment_448921" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T19:07:57+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  7:07PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess if you throw out all the mechanical parts of the chargen process it's easy to port around, but part of what is neat about it is the marriage of mechanical parts with narrative, and I feel it loses something by just ripping them out.<br/><br/>So if we want to avoid tearing everything out, it leaves us with stats, skills, and classes, mostly. The stat stuff is the easiest - anything with a standard D&amp;D style stat grouping could use these, and it's probably pretty easy to remap them elsewhere. The skills are harder.  For classes, since it's a 1 to 1 map of playbook to class anyway, a remap should be relatively easy unless there are multiple possibilities inside the game you are moving to.  But then I guess you could offer a choice or code it in somehow.<br/><br/>So yeah. You can do it.  Even without gutting the process mechanically. At some point, I might even try it with Dungeon World.  Though that might not be the finest fit for 'fairy tale' games either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448928/#Comment_448928" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T21:35:59+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  9:35PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside from the Shadow of Yesterday, the original Red Box Hack could work pretty well, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448930/#Comment_448930" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T22:08:43+00:00" title="October  7, 2015 10:08PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could see WoDu being a better fit than DW maybe, and you might be able to port over the base stats from ByW chargen.

(For instance, one of the characters can draw a chalk outline on a wall and then step through it, as though it were a door. The stats are things like "Sneakiness" and "Stubborness" - if that doesn't sound like a fairy tale story, I don't know what does.)<br/><br/>The focus of the rules is very different: there are no morale checks, surprise checks, Saves vs. Poison, or encumbrance modifiers. You don't have to worry about details or what equipment you're carrying; it's more about who you are and who you are up against. There's very little chance of dying of your injuries, and no rules for traps or instant death. It's all about creating whimsical adventure, instead (for instance, one of the most effective things you can do in a fight is "Showing Off" - doing something flashy to impress your opponents).<br/><br/>So, while it was inspired by D&amp;D, I don't think it shares much in common with it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
