Rules playtesting involves just seeing if people 'got' the rules and played properly with the given material and no designer input.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my playtest is more personal though - I am telling people how to play, and modifying the rules based on what I am observing. I am personally involved and have enough experience that I don't need to really ask them much, my observation is usually better than their feedback in any case. For example, when they say that the 'flavor' doesn't make sense they often are actually criticising the mechanics without realizing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are sending the game to people for this sort of feedback (often done with big games or one in which you or your personal playtest group are not the targte audience) then you will have to treat it differently, my experience here is much more limited. I would be cautious about how to interpret thier feedback though because playtesters have to be very good before they understand a lot of what you are looking for. Absolutely ask about the basics they do understand, however: how long was the game, did they make mistakes playing, were there rules they didn't get, was there a lot of time that players felt like they couldn't win, were there strategies they felt like they could follow or were they playing randomly. You can ask questions like "was it fun", and the feedback may be useful, but it will definitely require interpretation.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest Regards,<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard Garfield<br/>\n<br/>\nend quote:<br/>\n,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your new to play testing asking questions can be helpful eventually you will understand by how player's are acting if the game is doing what you want it too. but even after years of play testing I have been amused by a few people's feed back after playing a game. apparently some people like games where them make confused constipated faces while playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for taking notes and preparing a game to be tested i sugjest, taking a really good look at the back of a mouse guard character sheet, or what is more commonly know as a player aid. If I'm working on an rpg, board game, or card game I always make a player aid first! This is a outline of the procedure of play. It's also the very best place for yourself or players to make notes about what they liked and don't like about each part of the game. i make games that use components and i encourage my players to mark up the prototype directly.<br/>\n<br/>\ni think when people write a game that is untested with the idea that what they are writing is "final text" they become over invested in their mechanics or procedure. so i highly recommend using just a player aid during design and development. they cut to the chase and and are easy to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286595/#Comment_286595" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T02:21:00+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  2:21AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think I get all of that (or at least I get it enough to do play tests, not trying to knock the wisdom of your experience), my problem is more with communicating what goes on during a play test session for the purposes of sharing it here or on other forums or just for my own use as reference later. I came away with a lot of observations and some good suggestions nut I have very little idea how to share that info with a larger community. Maybe I shouldn't try, but it seems like a good way to generate interest in a game and get outside input into whats happening with your design.

The audio could be from blind playtesting or just permission from your regular group to be recorded.  Then you could include those audio files in an online design diary.  You could then reference the audio files elsewhere and turn the design process into its own creative product.  When you  publish the game, you could put the audio files and design diary into a CD that would be an "extra" to go along with the book (in the same way that they include the "making of" in the bonus material for DVDs).  You wouldn't have to include the CD in all of the books, but you could take it to conventions to sweeten the pot.<br><br>Alternately, and not to derail your post, people might bet interesting in working on a <i>generic playtester questionnaire form</i>, that anyone could use, which asked questions like: what worked, what didn't work, what happened in your game, how long did you play, etc.  After each playtest session, you could have people fill them out and post selected responses.  The benefit here is that you have a defined question and answer that illustrates your point of discussion when discussing your design on the forums.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286771/#Comment_286771" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T12:15:33+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 12:15PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've definitely thought about just recording the sessions, and I think that thats a good idea.

They determine how the players are rewarded for their role play or storytelling. so if the comic relief does something that makes everyone laugh they earn a point! stuff like that<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is no one wants to pick the hero character type. the game defines the hero as "a character who develops a story ark, and sacrifices to accomplish their goals,"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo can you think of a better way to describe this character type or maybe a better way to reward playing the hero archetype? I was thinking of changing the description to something like this "the hero is an epic character who suffers great setbacks and thrilling victories" but I'm not sure if this communicates how that player is supposed to develop their story.<br/>\n<br/>\nso I guess that is the way I would go about discussing play testing on forums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286836/#Comment_286836" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T15:14:57+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  3:14PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We have two testing methods.
