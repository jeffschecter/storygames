Like using Vampire the Masquerade to play a slapstick game or Paranoia to play a survival horror game<br/>\n4) Whacky Players - That one player that makes a barbarian with no social skills for your political intrigue game, yeah, he doesn't count either<br/>\n5) Whacky GMs - That GM that goes for 2 or more sessions without touching the dice, yeah, he doesn't count either.<br/>\n6) I don't want to discuss "System" or have an argument about Forge Theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaveat - I think the stuff I don't want to talk about is interesting and not necessarily an example of bad play or bad players, I just don't think these issues are conducive to discussing this topic. I mean, once you say, system doesn't matter, my GM uses Modern D20 to play everything from Modern, to fantasy to Wyld Fae adventures, then what else is there to talk about, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nNote - This was inspired by http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=427841<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the topic is, how much do the mechanics (not necessarily the "system" as that is too broad for this topic) affect play?<br/>\n<br/>\n  For instance, if you play a fantasy game, how different is your actual play, and the stories that are told by it, if you play Exalted vs D&amp;D vs GURPS vs some other system? Does the change in mechanics affect the way you play your characters?<br/>\n<br/>\n  And if so, why?<br/>\n<br/>\n  And if not, why?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Anyways, I hope this is a productive thread and if you want to discuss some of those things I voted against, start another thread and I will be glad to engage you there.<br/>\nDave M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182083/#Comment_182083" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T08:48:22+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  8:48AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really depends on the mechanics and the players.  If the mechanics are particularly flavorless or the GM just fiats most stuff or the players are prone to "roleplaying" a certain way despite what the rules reward or penalize then the effect is likely very slight.  If the mechanics are geared strongly toward a certain playstyle (intentionally or not), or the players are the sort to seek every available bonus or reward the rules provide, then the game will likely play much differently.  That said, "much differently" is still pretty mild.  As a rule, the game will probably just "feel" different.  Only at the extreme will players become frustrated and look for a different set of rules.<br/><br/>My group found, for example, that GURPS didn't handle "D&amp;D-style" fantasy very well (for us) by the rules.  Even the "fantasy adventure mode" rules tweaks didn't quite fix the issue.  This is because GURPS' default "realism" seemed to (for us) discourage heroic activity, as things were too "gritty" and heroism often wasn't worth the risk (for us).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182085/#Comment_182085" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T08:54:09+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  8:54AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>\n  So, are you saying that they do play differently and encourage different play (GURPS being too gritty, etc.) or that the response to mechanics that don't meet your expectations is houseruling or?

For one thing, mechanics dictate the sorts of characters you can make.  If my group is playing, say, second edition AD&amp;D with just the core rules, then I can't effectively create a character who's an artificer who creates mechanical creatures and devices and uses them to do things.  I could try to use that as "color" for one of the existing classes, but the mechanics don't really support the concept, so I'd be kludging it at best.  In first edition AD&amp;D, I can't make a thief who specializes in a few of the thieving skills -- the mechanics simply don't allow it.  In later editions, I can.<br/><br/>For another, mechanics determine the effectiveness of your character.  If I play a thief in first edition AD&amp;D, I have to resign myself to the fact that, except for Climb Walls, none of my thieving skills are going to be reliable, until I get to very high levels.  In GURPS, on the other hand, I can make a starting thief who's very good at what he does.<br/><br/>On the flip side of things, GURPS' combat system is oriented toward more gritty, realistic combat than xD&amp;D's.  If I want to make an epic warrior who routinely takes on dozens of foes and wins, xD&amp;D supports me in that more than GURPS does.<br/><br/>Going further, there are major differences in style between types of games.  A big part of point-based games, like GURPS and, even more strongly, the Hero System, is paying for your equipment.  In xD&amp;D, magic items are a big part of character power... but you get them essentially by GM fiat.  The difference in how much magic GMs give out is a large part of the difference between a "gritty" D&amp;D game and a "Monty Haul" one.  In Hero, however, players are supposed to buy magic items with points -- which gives the players much more control over what magic items they have, but also means that the GM isn't supposed to simply take those magic items away -- and if they do, the players get those points back to spend on something else (unless they've taken particular disadvantages, such as "independent", on those points).<br/><br/>System also dictates more basic things.  What races are available to select from.  What roles are available to those races -- I can be a dwarf wizard in GURPS, but not in AD&amp;D1 or 2.  Random-roll attributes can make a huge difference, if you're lucky or unlucky on your rolls.  To take it to the extreme, being lucky enough to roll an 18 while making a fighter in first or second edition AD&amp;D both gives you access to percentile strength -- and the huge bonuses it can give -- and gives you bonus experience points for having high strength, compounding your advantage over "normal" fighters over time.  On the flip side of things, having an 18 Intelligence as a wizard in first or second edition AD&amp;D means very little until you get to high levels -- especially since many groups ignored the rules for learning spells (which in itself is another example of how system makes a difference in play!).  You'd be better off putting that 18 into Dexterity (giving you a +4 to AC, a big bonus for wizards who can't wear armor) or Constitution (roughly doubling your hit points).<br/><br/>Which brings me to another example of how system matters in play -- early xD&amp;D's quirky multiclassing and dual-classing rules.  In GURPS or Hero, I can easily create a character who is mostly a warrior, but knows a little magic.  Early versions of xD&amp;D make that very difficult.  If I'm demi-human, I can multiclass as a fighter/mage, but there's no option to do anything but a 50/50 split of my XP, so I'm going to wind up about 50/50 fighter/mage.  If I'm human, I can dual-class, but that both requires very high ability scores (at least a 17 in the prime req for the class I want to switch to), and has some funky requirements.  Further, I can't *start* as a fighter who knows a little about magic.<br/><br/>So, yes... system affects play in a lot of ways, I'd say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182087/#Comment_182087" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T09:07:35+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Travis,<br/>\n  Well, that sounds more like a procedural difference. Do you actually play your characters differently based on those procedures? Like if you play GURPS, are you more prone to avoid a fight since the combat is more deadly. Or do you continue to act heroic and just die for it when the grit hits the fan? In HERO, are you more or less likely to loot an enemy knowing you will have to pay points to keep what you find? Or, do you loot them anyways, put them in a back pack and pay for them when you have a use for them (much like we did with crazy D&amp;D swords taht were +1, but +5 against Giants)? And either way you answer, why does that influence or lack thereof exist?<br/>\n  In the link I posted many players came forward and said that mechanics have no bearing on playstyle or theme. And since I feel the opposite, it made me think about my views on the matter. I know that when I make a character in RPGs, I generally make a highly driven character that is good at one thing at the sacrifice of others. And it made me wonder if I really am influenced by mechanics as much as I think I am...<br/>\n  What about you?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182092/#Comment_182092" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T09:15:53+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:15AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2008 9:17AM by komradebob.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I'm inclined to avoid <i>any activity </i>within a game that is likely to take up a bunch of real time due to mechanics.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'll use whatever room exists within a system to dodge those moments.<br/><br/>Incidently, that includes character creation, which leads back to gritty combat, in a way.

We realized that this wasn't fun for us at the time, so we switched rules.<br/><br/>So, yes, mechanics can encourage or discourage certain types of behavior and play.  And yes, you can possibly "fix" the rules with houserules, but then you're arguably not playing by the same rules anymore.<br/><br/>I say "can", of course, because a player can choose to "ignore" the rules and just play how they want.  From GURPS we switched to Castles &amp; Crusades which seemed to work better for our group.  Personally, it doesn't do anything interesting for me, so I just ignore the rules and play how I want to play, relying on the GM to save my bacon (or alternately resigning myself to making a new character).  But I had to make a conscious decision to do so, as the rules in the book certainly don't support my playstyle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182098/#Comment_182098" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T09:36:24+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:36AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanics in traditional games tend to be highly optional. Depending on the group any given mechanics will be used or ignored, modified or preserved. In a real way, the group comes to discover a game among themselves as they play it. From this perspective it seems like the mechanics which aren't used have no effect on play. But this is not quite accurate.<br/><br/>Mechanics define the game in a conceptual way. This means that players will make a conscious choice to engage or disengage with those mechanics, but they rarely make their choices irrespective of those mechanics. Thus the social structuring of play becomes a series of binary choices, about when to incorporate the mechanics and when to expel them. This really narrows the space of play, because before considering the mechanics the group could have done any number of things, but now all their decisions are made in the context of the mechanics.<br/><br/>Specific options tend to polarize our thinking to accepting, declining, or perhaps permuting that option. Truly different choices which might have occurred to us before hand are now nearly unthinkable. This is even more the case when variant mechanics are used, they become conceptually an exhaustive set.<br/><br/>All of this exerts a tendency for everything explicit in the rules, like stats defining a character, to be either explicitly relevant or explicitly irrelevant. The rules become a language for what happens in play, they determine what is easy to say, and what is hard. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182106/#Comment_182106" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T09:48:20+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:48AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the most important impact of the system and the mechanics is how they shape the role of the participants in play.<br/><br/>The GM and players will approach a game with certain default assumptions about how it's supposed to work and what they're supposed to "do". If the mechanics of the ruleset all apply to other stuff, then they won't change gameplay in any way except cosmetically. However, if and when the mechanics DO intersect with those assumed procedures, they most definitely will change gameplay.<br/><br/>For instance, consider a game group whose heroes fight and overcome monsters, and never really have a serious chance of dying. They could pick up GURPS, make characters that are significantly more powerful than the opposition (either by making the heroes stronger or making the opposition weaker) and go for it, with the GM fudging any die rolls that might kill the heroes. Their games wouldn't be all that different. They might feel it's "harder" or less natural to get that preferred gameplay in that system, but it won't stop them, per se.<br/><br/>However, if they pick up a game that doesn't allow anyone to fudge results, or a game that contains mechanics which do not allow player characters to be heroes (say, some kind of morale system), or (heaven forbid) a game that doesn't have a GM-figure, their playstyle will HAVE to change. Because the "unwritten" parts of their group's System will clash with the mechanics provided by the game. <br/><br/>I think that a lot of groups in that situation just modify the mechanics until their preferred playstyle becomes possible again, often because they perceive them as broken. After all, they can't play the way they know they're "supposed to" play, so there must be something wrong with the rules, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182110/#Comment_182110" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T09:50:53+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:50AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite><br/>In the link I posted many players came forward and said that mechanics have no bearing on playstyle or theme.</blockquote>\nWell I'd have to say that they aren't paying attention.  Common sense will tell you that if the rules reward certain play and punish other play, then unless the players make a concious effort to ignore the obvious, the rules will affect their playstyle, or if they refuse to adapt, their playstyle will affect their choice of rules.  And even if they choose to play counter to that structure, the rules continue to support whatever theme they support, even if only as examples of the downside of that theme.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem is that many gamers don't actually follow the rules, or do so only at the GM's whim, or when it's convenient.  As such, they might think that the rules don't affect playstyle/theme because when the rules tried to promote a certain style or theme, the group stepped around them because "the rules are just guidelines".<br/><br/>Consider how Vampire games tended (in some people's experience) to devolve into undead action squads rather than the angsty undeath-spiral that was described in the flavor-text.  This is because (IMO) the Humanity rules were underused (or outright ignored), with many players jumping into the thematically muddled "paths" instead as soon as the rules presented themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182117/#Comment_182117" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T10:14:53+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 10:14AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/>\n  I find that rules in indie games are just as optional.

And it certainly debunks a lot of the reward/punishment ideas that some designers espouse. I mean if players actively ignore a given reward/punishment, then it is, in effect, neutralized. The same can be said about this idea that houseruling is a sign of a broken game.

I can see what you mean.  I beleive the agreement to use the rules, straight or modified, strictly or loosely, is part of the social contract.  That doesn't mean the game is or isn't "broken" (however that is judged).  I think houserules are more a sign of a (percieved) conflict of expectations (or creative agenda) between the players and the rules.

I qualified my first sentence about optionality so as to avoid getting into any arguments over whether indie games are highly optional or not - as that is a current subject of debate. <br/><br/>More to the point, the rules might encourage a player to choose to either fight or flee a foe, rather than fall in love with the foe. Not because the rules exclude this as an option, but because it is neither one of the options enumerated nor easily constructed from the enumerated options (by reversing, combining etc.). <br/><br/>In fact what I describing goes far beyond RPGs, it's basic human cognition. By giving structure the game seeds creativity, but in doing so it also constrains that creativity, by what is possible, but more so by what is <i>conceivable</i>.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182146/#Comment_182146" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T11:07:36+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 11:07AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Paul,<br/>If I am reading you right, you are saying that the mechanics don't actually influence play.

The whole house ruling issue is kind of a side effect.<br/><br/>My point is that, if players are ignoring and/or bending mechanics to get their play to work, we can't say that the mechanics aren't influencing their play. <br/><br/>The real role of the mechanics is to structure the interaction between the players at the table. If you took D&amp;D and starting rolling 3d6 instead of 1d20, no, it wouldn't change things very much, in terms of a larger picture. Many people play games that are basically D&amp;D with different dice, and don't perceive major differences in gameplay. But that's because those games only explore a very small fraction of the possibilities of what mechanics do in play.<br/><br/>I also really strongly agree with what Mendel just said--the game's structure seeds and constrains creativity, not only defining what is possible, but what is conceivable.

They can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the group and situation. I often find understanding this useful because it can help me avoid accidentally taking play somewhere that will require a reference frame shift on the part of the other players (because I share a different set of conceptual limits than the other players). It also helps me avoid feeling off when players break my limits. Intentionally expanding the conceptual scope of play is sometimes fine, but it pays to be careful. <br/><br/>Ultimately, of course it is very difficult to realize what it is you are not thinking. I find this idea more useful in game design. Effects like this influence play behavior as much or more than hard rules. It's part of the whole process of induction - how the game text becomes the game as it's played. Something I strongly feel is the next frontier of RPG design and theory.<br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182170/#Comment_182170" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T12:21:21+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 12:21PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Travis,<br/>Well, that sounds more like a procedural difference. Do you actually play your characters differently based on those procedures? Like if you play GURPS, are you more prone to avoid a fight since the combat is more deadly. Or do you continue to act heroic and just die for it when the grit hits the fan? In HERO, are you more or less likely to loot an enemy knowing you will have to pay points to keep what you find? Or, do you loot them anyways, put them in a back pack and pay for them when you have a use for them (much like we did with crazy D&amp;D swords taht were +1, but +5 against Giants)? And either way you answer, why does that influence or lack thereof exist?</blockquote>\nYes, I did and do play them differently based on the mechanics.  In GURPS, I'm definitely more prone to avoid a fight.  In Hero, we pretty much never looted individual enemies -- and the magic items we got were more often of the "I found a wizard to make this magic sword for me" sort, rather than "I got this off a guy I killed once."  Playing a thief in older AD&amp;D, I'd concentrate on equipment, gimmicks, and "working the GM" with plans rather than using my skills, because I know they're not reliable.  Playing one instead in GURPS, I'd know my skills would have a much better chance of working, and therefore would use the rest less.<br/><br/>In AD&amp;D, playing a wizard, I'd get all the scrolls, potions, wands, etc. I could, because my spells would run out quickly.  I'd also avoid any kind of melee as much as possible, due to the combination of low hit points and lousy armor.  In GURPS, on the other hand, a powerstone was basically all the magic items I'd need, since I could have a wide variety of spells, and could keep casting them as long as my powerstone + fatigue held out.  Further, I could learn decent melee skills if I wanted to, and so didn't have to avoid combat so much.  Thus, the way I played a wizard character in AD&amp;D and GURPS differed greatly.<br/><br/>Heck, look at some of the stuff that Gygax and Co. wrote -- I remember Gygax writing about players slaying a dragon, and then discovering that they had an even harder problem -- namely, how were they going to get all the treasure they'd gotten back home, between the volume of it and the other inhabitants of the area hearing the dragon is dead and moving in to try to take a piece of it?  AD&amp;D has encumbrance rules -- but if you ignore them and just handwave carrying stuff around, like a lot of people do, then that has a major effect on play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182174/#Comment_182174" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T12:40:53+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 12:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like one of the things that game designers would benefit from doing is "managing expectations" about the styles of play that their games support.

You must be willing to compete with your fellow players to play this game.<br/>Burning Wheel - By pursuing your character's goals you gain Artha.  By taking dangerous risks your characters advances.  You don't have to do either but if either is absent the game will be very boring for the players ("nothing is happening") and very frustrating for the GM ("Why aren't my players perusing their beliefs and taking risks?")<br/>D&amp;D - You are rewarded for killing things, and to a lesser extent overcoming skill challenges.  Further, 90% of what is on the character sheet revolves around killing things.  If you don't kill things you will not reasonably progress.<br/><br/>In each of these games there is a strong carrot and stick response caused by the mechanical reward system.  Sure, in any of those games you're character might feel a great sense of victory killing the man that killed his father, but of them only Burning Wheel will give him a reward specifically for achieving that goal.  In D&amp;D he might get experience points, but he'd get the same experience points if he killed some monster of equal level (4th) or CR (3.x).<br/><br/>So, yes, my experience is that mechanics strongly affect play styles because players want rewards for play.  If they play a game that doesn't reward them for the type of actions their characters take, it quickly becomes frustrating for the players.<br/><br/>Now... if you include Shadows of Yesterday in the mix, that's a whole other story.<br/><br/>-Sean                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182310/#Comment_182310" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T06:55:03+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  6:55AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sean,<br/>\n  I don't know if that is true. What you point to is maybe designer intent at most. What I am asking about is actual player behavior. In other words, if I make a brave, bold fighter in D&amp;D and as similar a character as I can in say, Rolemaster. And they are both set in Middle Earth. Will I (or you), necessarily, play that character differently because of the mechanics involved? Certainly one set of mechanics will reward risk differently than another. And the penalties for failing after taking that risk will be different too. But, would you play that character differently because of that?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182314/#Comment_182314" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T07:01:24+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  7:01AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grab a copy of Tomb of Horrors.<br/><br/>Make a set of D&amp;D4 characters.<br/><br/>Make a set of Spirit of the Century characters.<br/><br/>Make a set of Burning Wheel characters.<br/><br/>Hit the Tomb with each group of characters, playing their source rules in the RAW.<br/><br/>Do you really think the game will play/feel the same?

Even though the levels of risk to their characters might be drastically different.<br/>\n  So, the guy who plays the Fighter in your scenarios. Is he going to run from a fight more or less often based on the mechanics being different? Some people say yes. The introduction of higher rates of character death when characters take on unnecessary risk will deter them from taking those risks. But, I think I want to challenge that assumption. It seems to me that many players will play their character the same regardless of mechanics and then feel different about it afterward.<br/>\n  Is that not your experience?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182321/#Comment_182321" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T07:55:14+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  7:55AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave: I'm not sure how to answer that question, since I don't know how to create an apples-to-apples comparison. Which is, I think, the very point of this exercise.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure you <i>can</i> create characters in, say, D&amp;D, BW and SotC of similar expertise. And besides, the bulk of the actual at-the-table decision-making in a BW or SotC game (in particular) happens outside an assessment of the character's skill set. <br/><br/>This is probably an easier exercise if you compare games that measure only character abilities: you could probably parallel-code a HERO and GURPS game and then watch the two versions play concurrently. Many years ago, Steve Long and I talked about a "Rosetta Stone" type project that'd concurrently code modules, characters, setting materials, etc across HERO, GURPS, BESM, BRP, d20SRD and a bunch of other systems.<br/><br/>I'm thinking your question becomes impossible to answer once you start introducing games outside the traditional sphere.

If a player fights the same way in Burning Wheel as he does in GURPS, he's (very clearly) "whacky", just like the guy who creates a barbarian in a social game. I'm honestly not sure what else you're trying to get at here. <br/><br/>I mean, there will always be players out there who want to play a particular character or type of character (such as the fighter who doesn't run, since that seems to be coming up pretty often) but that kind of concept <i>always</i> changes when exposed to the mechanics, usually leading to compromises. "Can I make a character that does X?" "Kind of, how about Y." is a discussion I've seen crop up a lot in trad games, especially games like HERO and GURPS (and for that matter, Burning Wheel). <br/><br/>But a player, or group of players, that ignores the implications of the mechanics entirely I would clarify as "whacky" and you don't want us talking about those kinds of players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182343/#Comment_182343" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T08:57:02+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  8:57AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2008 8:57AM by Adam_Dray.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Show me how to make a "Defender of the weak" in Rummy or Monopoly and use it for a role-playing game. It's an absurd case, but I think it illustrates my point. System is everything. <br/><br/>If you have two RPG systems and you're saying that it doesn't matter much which one you use, because you'll ultimately get the same (or close) play experience out of either, then I think one of two things is likely:<br/><br/>a) You're not using the game system as written. You're ignoring a large part of the rules. Why does it make sense to use this case as an example of "mechanics do not affect play" if you're not using the damned mechanics? I mean, "how much do mechanics affect play if you don't use them" is a sort of stupid question, right?<br/><br/>b) The two games you're comparing aren't all that different, fundamentally. Can you get largely the same play experience out of, say, D&amp;D 2E and Warhammer 40K and Palladium Fantasy? Probably. There will be places that things are different, and religious wars might be fought over them, but I argue that they're not all that different and a group who wants to do so, can get similar play out of them.<br/><br/>We're not really gonna have a "System Does Not Matter" debate here, are we?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182344/#Comment_182344" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T08:58:29+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  8:58AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I honestly have no idea how to answer the question, Dave.<br/><br/>For me, the entire game experience arises from the system. I mean like <i>every single assumption</i> -- what's a suitable situation? What are suitable character types? Am I aiming for genre fidelity? Am I asking a Big Question? Or are we setting up loosely connected arena combats with talky stuff in between?<br/><br/>Seriously, the question just doesn't click with me. RPGs aren't like operating systems, for me. It's like asking something along the lines of, "In Risk, you're acquiring territory. In El Grande, you're acquiring territory. Did the system really matter, or did the fear of losing territory keep you from doing so in one or the other games?"<br/><br/>The best I can do is talk in hypotheticals, and I fucking hate doing that. But let's say I have a "defender of the weak" aspect on a SotC character, and I've built a "defender of the weak" D&amp;D character, probably some version of a Fighter. Well, first off I'm enjoying a fairly substantial mechanical advantage in SotC whenever I'm defending the weak: the system rewards me for doing so (and sometimes punishes me for <i>not</i> doing so). There are numerous play expectations baked into the game text of SotC, such that I feel like jumping feet-first into two-fisted action is what I'm "supposed" to do. <br/><br/>So then I have a "defender of the weak" Fighter. Whether I jump into the fray or not really depends on my threat assessment. Is my level high enough? What do I think the other thing can do to me? Will I have time to assess my situation once I'm into it or will I die in the first roll? Do I have bailout options?<br/><br/>Over on the SotC side, assuming I'm playing RAW, I've got puh-lenty of time to get traction on my opponent or at least know where the fight's going. If I'm a 1st level fighter in D&amp;D, I might get my character smoked in one round. If I'm playing a higher-level character, the same thing might happen, depending on whether the GM has cooked up a fighter-killing machine that carefully avoids my strengths.<br/><br/>Just for laffs, we can mix in BW. So I build a BW character with some kind of "defend the weak" Belief. Rock on, so now at least I'm getting Fate for doing that -- kind of on-par with SotC. But if I get into a scripted Fight! in BW, that's super-duper scary because scripting commits me to the fight for at least 4-5 rolls. That uncertainty is by design (and IMO why scripting sits so very poorly with a lot of players), and utterly different than either SotC or D&amp;D. So, yeah, I might think long and hard about getting into the same fight that I'd have no problem getting into in SotC.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182348/#Comment_182348" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T09:05:08+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:05AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>\n  If I read you right, you are saying that you do a threat assessment before making any critical decisions in an RPG. and that's fine, that's all I wanted to know.<br/>\n  We can get bigger or smaller if you want, but I just wanted to know how much you considered the mechanical implications of an action before your character took that action.<br/>\n  Thanks for your thoughtful responses.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182350/#Comment_182350" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T09:16:36+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  9:16AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/>\n  Well, I tried my damnedest to create a level playing field for discussion. Its hard because people want to bring up chess and/or other useless examples.<br/>\n  And, well, to be frank, I tried to eliminate examples where people aren't using the rules. Cuz, come on, how do you enter into a dialog where the dialog gets shut down by examples that aren't relevant.<br/>\n  I thought SotC and D&amp;D were pretty different. I will admit to not having played SotC, but Paul brought it up and I would rather let him talk about a system he knows than pull the rug out from under him.<br/>\n  As to "System doesn't matter" I don't know if we are debating that. I just wanted to ask a question and see what people said. Maybe try and get their take on it.<br/>\n  So, to get at what I am asking, do the characters act different because of:<br/>\n1) Mechanical risk, reward, penalty<br/>\n2) Setting<br/>\n3) Player mood<br/>\n4) Random crap<br/>\n5) They don't act different, why are you asking?<br/>\n  What I am hearing a lot, and is resonating with me is, the character will act the same, the consequences will be different and the "feeling" generated by those consequences will be different. But, that the mechanical risk is not the deciding factor. there are exceptions, but it is interesting to contemplate, isn't it?<br/>\n  The fact that some designers (just as an example) make combat more lethal in order to discourage combat and then the players will engage in combat with the same frequency.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have always been a system matters kinda guy. But I am just questioning that rather than cling to it dogmatically, is that ok?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

It's some kind of mind-body dualistic argument that just doesn't wash with me. The character is an artifact of the game. <br/><br/>There might be, in your head, this Platonic version of your character, and you express that character through the lens of an RPG. If that's the case, then it's impossible to perfectly play the character in any system at all. But let's say that System XYZ just happens to be perfect for playing Bob the Barbarian or whatever. System ABC won't be. Maybe System ABC is fucking Bunnies and Burrows, or Maid, or Paranoia, and it's not gonna come close to letting you represent your Ideal Bob the Barbarian.<br/><br/>Why not? Well, first, because RPGs have Character rules. You have to express Bob as a character with those rules, which might not address some vital aspect ("There's no Strength attribute of any kind?!") or which may require you to address some aspect that is totally irrelevant to your character ideal ("What do you mean, choose a sexual fetish?!").<br/><br/>Second, the game's Setting may not fit into your vision for the character. Bob the Barbarian probably has no place in a Ghostbusters game. <br/><br/>Third, the game's Situation may not be appropriate for the character. Where does Bob fit into, "You're a crime detective, searching for clues to stop a serial killer before he kills again"?<br/><br/>Fourth, the game's Color may not permit your character. "What do you mean, there are no barbarians in this game? It's a fantasy game, so there must be barbarians. No?"<br/><br/>Last, the game's System may get in the way of playing your character. Other people above talk about this kind of stuff, but it may ultimately be less important than the other four things I mention. Maybe stakes-setting and director stance fuck up your ability to get into Bob's head and immerse properly. Maybe you want to start out Bob as a low-level barbarian and see him climb to power over time, and a game without heroic advancement rules won't do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182389/#Comment_182389" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T10:32:22+00:00" title="December  9, 2008 10:32AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>You make a "Defender of the weak" in SotC.

I shared the concept of playing Burning Wheel with my group, explained how it was quite radically different in concept from WFRP, and asked them if they wanted to start a BW game.  Enthusiastic "Yes!" from everyone.<br/><br/>However, we're about six sessions in on the BW game and I'm seeing <i>very</i> distinct implications of System Matters on their play style.  Not so much that their style has changed with the switch from WFRP to BW, but <b>that it HASN'T</b>, and that is having a dramatic effect.  Thus, a large amount of frustration is being generated that wasn't present in the WFRP game.  The mechanics of BW require that you, the player, push the story forward rather than follow the GM's lead.  If you don't, then you don't tap into the Artha cycle and you fail a lot.  My players are just now grokking this economy in play, and will hopefully develop some traction with it.  Their playstyles will adapt to the mechanics, or we will have to abandon the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182456/#Comment_182456" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T13:43:07+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  1:43PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/>\n  I don't really want to discuss if "System Matters" but instead if mechanics affect the decision make process in an RPG, and if so, how much and why that amount.<br/>\n  From your anecdote, you are saying that the mechanics did not affect their behavior and that it is causing dissatisfaction. but the characters are still acting the same.<br/>\n  That is fascinating.

Cyberpunk has a certain amount of niche protection through Roles (Netrunner, Corp, Rocker, Solo, etc.) and you have to choose one of those roles. Cyberpunk won't let you make a stay-at-home mom who gets caught up in a bigger story unless you pigeon-hole her into one of the roles. But you asked if we make up Netrunners in both games, so let's go with that.<br/><br/>A strength and weakness of Verge is the lack of attributes and skills. My Cyberpunk netrunner has Intelligence 8 and Cool 3. She has Cybertech 9 and Programming 6. My parallel Verge character doesn't have any of that stuff mechanically. She has some relationships to things like her Cyberdeck, her six-year-old daughter, and maybe to Megasoft Corp's black-ops director who wants to kill her because he thinks she saw something. And those relationships have a numerical weight, too. <br/><br/>In a way, the Cyberpunk character is constrained. She can do the things she has skills for. My Verge analog can do anything but she has to do it through her relationships. That affects how I approach play. <br/><br/>Also, Verge asks the players to create situation via the network map they draw. Cyberpunk asks the GM to create situation for the characters -- often a mission-based thing. The approach to play is totally different. But is one more likely to hack?<br/><br/>I think your question is leading. Worded another way, you asked me, "Is a hacker in Verge more likely to hack than a character in CP2020?" They're both hackers. If they don't do some hacking, then they're not hackers. Is a ninja more likely to do ninja things in D&amp;D or Palladium? Is that really the question you're after? If so, I don't think the answer can logically be anything other than "No, of course not. They are ninja by definition, so they do ninja things."<br/><br/>Now, if you want to ask how well different games support stuff, that's different. But I think everyone agrees that some games support doing certain things well and support doing other things poorly. I can't be a serious ninja very easily in, say, Toon or Ghostbusters. I can't play a cartoon character at all in The Mountain Witch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182482/#Comment_182482" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T16:01:49+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  4:01PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2008 4:14PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Are simple choices about characters' actions the only thing you're interested in? Because system and mechanics come into play at so many other levels, that I can't answer your question until you've narrowed down the question a bit.<br/><br/>Let's see:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Hi!<br/>And the topic is, how much do the mechanics (not necessarily the "system" as that is too broad for this topic) affect play?<br/><br/>For instance, if you play a fantasy game, how different is your actual play, and the stories that are told by it, if you play Exalted vs D&amp;D vs GURPS vs some other system? Does the change in mechanics affect the way you play your characters?<br/></blockquote>\nMost people are answering the "how different is your actual play, and the stories that are told by it" part. And that's huge. Character types (like classes or other assumptions) change things. What kind of GM prep can be done and needs to be done changes what kind of play you will get. Character creation will change things--people will make different characters in different systems. For instance, I won't make the same character in random chargen D&amp;D and point-buy D&amp;D unless I just happen to roll exactly the same stats, will I? The assumed power levels, risk levels, and all that other stuff will change things. The implied tone of the game books and the presentation of the game will change things. <br/><br/>As for character actions, here are some simple ones:<br/><br/>If I am playing a magician, how much time will I spend studying my spellbooks, if any?<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, it'll be up to 15 minutes per spell level, or whatever it is, depending on how much fighting has been going on.<br/>In GURPS, it might be "only rarely, when I need to research new spells".<br/>In some other game it might be, "no, magicians don't know how to read".<br/><br/>If I am playing a swordsman, how often will I try to parry an opponent's attack in combat instead of attacking myself?<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, never. Parrying is not an option. You always attack; parrying is kinda maybe assumed to happen all the time anyway.<br/>In Rapiers Combat (a made-up game), I will Parry about 60% of the time, because it lets me accumulate an advantage over my opponent.<br/>In System d65, I will parry each time I roll a 6 in combat, because the book says "When you roll a 6, you have successfully parried your opponent's attack. You may proceed to roll your attack now."<br/>In yet another game, I will never parry. I'd love to, because it suits my character, but the rules are set up so that parrying almost always means you get your arm cut off, and that DOESN'T suit my character.<br/><br/>etc.<br/><br/>The stuff that won't vary very much ("will I rescue the little boy?") likely is the same from game to game precisely because it isn't covered by mechanics. In other words, those choices are exactly the same, governed the same way by the mechanics, in those different games.

For example: how effective a character with a .44 or an assault rifle will be is often determined by the rules. How safe jumping from a four-story building is (in Hero we had characters jump off of high buildings to escape certain-death monsters--not so in GURPS--and a lot of debate in DitV as to how it'd work).<br/><br/>Even if--especially if--a rule is not invoked it can effect play. Even in the case where house-rules are used (by surprise--something I do not advocate) over printed rules, the presence of the rules can effect expectations (and that includes the complex case where the player knows the printed rule is either considered weak or otherwise suspects it may do something counter to the flow of the game and may or may not take action based on it being used).<br/><br/>In a Hero espionage game where players were from competing agencies and were forbidden to use "deadly force" against each other, one guy (KGB) shot an American agent with a low-caliber handgun since the 1d6 RKA damage <i>couldn't</i> kill them. I, as the GM, disallowed that (I allowed the action but told them the agency would interpret it as deadly force--the player, a pretty rules-laywerish guy--was okay with that interpretation and didn't pull the trigger. In GURPS that probably wouldn't have been an issue.)<br/><br/>As Adam has astutely noted: char-gen effects the game from the starting point on and, notably, IME changing rules during char-gen is different than during play since the "surprise" element is often taken out of the equation (yes, you can be surprised--but more likely there will be discussion of the changes <i>before</i> any impact to the fiction happens).<br/><br/>Finally, there are subtle, experiential elements to mechanics that can impact play in a variety of ways. Many people can better calculate odds in a percentile system. Some folks find "exploding dice" add to the excitement (others hate it). People have mathematically irrational  beliefs about roll-over-vs-roll under (as well as legitimate preferences). Some people find systemic "break points" (where one set of numbers is treated differently than others) bizarrely rules-breaking. And so on (playing with playing cards has a different tactile feel than dice).<br/><br/>How this impacts play is probably very hard to measure--but I submit that it does (VtM's use of fictional characters to delineate different levels of skill, for example, really impacted the feel of the otherwise to-me-boring number-of-dots system. D6 Star Wars' use of dice for <i>stats</i> made me feel like my character's abilities were <i>less reliable</i> even though there was no mathematical basis for that.<br/><br/>I was going to say that rules were optional in indie games too--that's from posts, reading them, and experience--I'm glad someone else said it here first.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich" title="Will Grzanich"><img alt="Will Grzanich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich">Will Grzanich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182567/#Comment_182567" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T07:00:25+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  7:00AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if this is relevant:<br/><br/>My RPG buddies and I usually play D&amp;D, in one form or another.  We played D&amp;D 3.5 for a good long while.  Our strategy in combat usually ended up to be this:  the melee brawler types would rush in to beat up on the nearest bad guy.  If flanking or other beneficial tactics were convenient and easy to pull off, they'd maybe do that, but mostly, they wouldn't worry about it.  Meanwhile, the ranged attackers (mostly wizards and archers) would hang back and plink away at whatever baddies they could get a clear shot at.  This, for the most part, worked just fine.<br/><br/>Then I DMed a game of 4th Edition for them.  The first couple of fights were...<i>educational</i>.  They tried the same tactics they were used to in 3.5e, and it was a train wreck, an absolute slaughter.  They got their asses handed to them.  Tactics in 4e are Serious Business, and if you aren't careful about working together as a team, you'll lose hard.  Once they got the hang of things, the game got a lot easier (i.e., it was appropriately challenging, as opposed to impossible).<br/><br/>In other words, you could create a fighter in 3.5e, and a fighter in 4e, and you <i>can't</i> play them the same way, at least in combat.<br/><br/>-Will                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182574/#Comment_182574" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T07:39:22+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  7:39AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Namely: Does the severity of harm mechanics, across a variety of "trad" games, impact your willingness to commit to a course of action?</blockquote>\nWorded another way, do you risk your character differently if there are different consequences?

In my mind, there is no wrong answer to the question, "how do you game?"<br/></blockquote>\nI finally understood your question!<br/><br/>I'm not sure your read-back is quite accurate though. "Bravery" isn't something that is an absolute, is it? It is a referent to the reality of the world you live in. If nothing bad ever happens in world X, then being "brave" there could mean fighting <i>at all</i>. If terrible, violent things happen every day in world Z, then being "brave" there may not even include fighting (hell, everyone fights or they'd be dead). Being brave there might require withstanding terrible torture.<br/><br/>The game mechanics represent the world reality. Maybe that's my answer. Maybe not everyone plays that way. <br/><br/>When I play D&amp;D 4E, I know that I can take a few sword hacks before I go down. When I play -- fuck, I dunno -- RuneQuest*, I know that one sword hack could kill me dead. If I translated my 4E character to RQ, I don't think I'd play him the same, or he'd end up dead really fast. He'd be just as brave, though, because being brave in the RQ universe is different than being brave in the 4E universe.<br/><br/><br/>* I have never actually played RuneQuest                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182593/#Comment_182593" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T09:48:15+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  9:48AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>David,<br/>I don't really want to discuss if "System Matters" but instead if mechanics affect the decision make process in an RPG, and if so, how much and why that amount.<br/>From your anecdote, you are saying that the mechanics did not affect their behavior and that it is causing dissatisfaction. but the characters are still acting the same.<br/>That is fascinating. And I think that maybe somewhere between 1/3rd and 1/2 of players play that way. That's just a rough estimate based on forum responses, but it is an interesting fact in my mind.<br/>Still not sure what it means per se, but its soemthing, isn't it?<br/>Dave M</blockquote>\nHmm...it's hard to separate System Matters from the issue of whether System Affects Behavior.  <br/><br/>I think that a system will definitely affect the behavior of players if the players understand the system, are aware of its sticks and carrots and are willing to play to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182602/#Comment_182602" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T10:17:47+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 10:17AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/>\n  Well, the reason I want to extract "System" from the discussion is that, for many people, System is more than just mechanics. It includes setting, fluff text and even the author's voice in the writing of the text. And at that point, System HAS to affect play, because there is practically no game without System, right?<br/>\n  And I don't really know the details of the System Matters theory very well. Because, as I understand it, its a no brainer. Of course, I may be upside down on that matter, but that is not really what I want to talk about here.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8268/how-much-do-mechanics-affect-play" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8268/how-much-do-mechanics-affect-play" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8268/how-much-do-mechanics-affect-play/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8268%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8268%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
