And, quite frankly I am overwhelmed by the sheer volume of indie games available right now. So, what I am looking for is a kind of "Story Game's Canon." The games that really bring out the key concepts and ideas emphasized in story gaming. Up to this point I have just been jumping around snagging things that looked interesting, but I have already accumulated more than I could read in a practical amount of time. I need help prioritizing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what I've bought so far:<br/>\n\u2022 Burning Wheel Revised (but I am holding off until I get BWG)<br/>\n\u2022 lumpley suite (I've read DitV)<br/>\n\u2022 Dresden Files<br/>\n\u2022 Legends of Anglerre<br/>\n\u2022 Spirit of the Century<br/>\n\u2022 Strands of Fate (reading this now)<br/>\n\u2022 Fiasco<br/>\n\u2022 Houses of the Blooded<br/>\n\u2022 ICONs<br/>\n\u2022 Microscope<br/>\n\u2022 Prime Time Adventures<br/>\n\u2022 Reign<br/>\n\u2022 Solar System (I've read this)<br/>\n\u2022 3:16<br/>\n\u2022 Universalis<br/>\n\u2022 AGON<br/>\n\u2022 Don't Read Your Head<br/>\n\u2022 Dread (read / ran this, loved it)<br/>\n\u2022 A Penny for My Thoughts<br/>\n\u2022 Colonial Gothic Revised<br/>\n\u2022 Estoterrorists<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's my understanding that Sorcerer is an important read, it is still relevant? What else am I missing? I hear talk about Hero Banner and HeroQuest mentioned, are they worth picking up? <br/>\n<br/>\nTo reiterate, I'm looking for the best of breed that demonstrate story games techniques in practice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333676/#Comment_333676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T09:16:56+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  9:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should seriously check out <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/lady_blackbird.pdf" rel="nofollow">Lady Blackbird</a> and <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a>. They're short, they're awesome, they're free and they encapsulate a lot of important mechanics and techniques in one concise package.<br/><br/>From your list, I'd say you're maybe missing Polaris and maybe Smallville...but there are just so many cool games out there.<br/><br/>Prioritizing your list I'd say if you read Strands then you can leave Dresden, Spirit otC, Legends of A and ICONS for later because they're all basically FATE with minor cosmetic changes, unless you want to really dig in deep with various variants of the system. Houses of the Blooded is FATE at heart, too, but brings some funky stuff to the table like Wagers.<br/><br/>If you've got the lumpley suite totally read Apocalypse World. Especially if you're looking for techniques in practice.<br/><br/>Fiasco, Microscope and Penny are all exercises in group storyjamming. PTA is a classic. Reign is important because of its Company rules. Esoterrorists (and other GUMSHOE games) are important because of how they deal with investigations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333680/#Comment_333680" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T09:32:45+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  9:32AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://memento-mori.com/online-store/inspectres/" rel="nofollow">InSpectres</a>.

Pick one of the games you've got. Make sure it's one you're excited about. Just play it. A one-off game is a low-risk investment for other players and many of the games will have sample scenarios available for you to try out. Get a feel for how it works. Then, if you want to, try a few more sessions of the same game or try a different game.<br/><br/>The thing is, these are games, and are designed to be played. If you're just reading about the cogs and various moving parts, you won't get to see them in action and so won't really understand what the games are going on about.<br/><br/>Nothing on your list is bad. Pick one, play it, try it out.<br/><br/>If it was me, I'd probably first try out Dogs in the Vineyard, Spirit of the Century, or Primetime Adventures as games that reliably give a good game. PTA is the furthest from a "trad" game. But your preferences will vary, so just go for one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333702/#Comment_333702" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T18:09:04+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  6:09PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil</cite>read less and play more</blockquote>\nThis times a million.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333705/#Comment_333705" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T19:11:28+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  7:11PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2011 7:14PM by ccreitz.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, reading and playing aren't mutually exclusive, or interchangeable. Reading is ten or a hundred times easier than playing, and if you've read PTA before playing DitV, maybe you come to the table with good ideas you might not have had otherwise. Let's honor the OP's intent.<br/><br/>I'd add Storming the Wizard's Tower, the forerunner to AW, to your list (Vince has a playtest ms up for free, which you should google). Reading them side-by-side is instructive. Also, Puppetland (free version online, google, but if I were you I'd find the print version at your favorite used book outlet) is very short, and amazing.<br/><br/>Also, Daniel Solis' games Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple, Happy Birthday Robot!, and The Leftovers present a very different relationship betweeen players and fiction than is usually contemplated by story games.

I did neglect to mention my familiarity with Lady Blackbird and Mouse Guard. I was listing things I purchased and totally forgot to include things that were free or borrowed. Also, I bought the PDF for Free Market yesterday so that also slipped my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those recommending play over reading, I'd love to. However, my play opportunities are rather limited at the moment. About a year ago I took the reigns for organized RPG play at the local FLGS. Things started out slowly, but we began to build a bit of a gaming community. And then, reality happened. In the fourth quarter last year my FLGS finally went under, and the sister FLGS was forced to move into a smaller retail space so there was no longer a gaming area. Effectively ending the gaming movement before it had an opportunity to get off the ground. What remains are a few fragmented groups who play irregularly. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy group is in the middle of a Star Wars SAGA edition campaign. So, the only story gaming that occurs are one shots between story arcs in the campaign. I have been pitching games unsuccessfully for the most part. Recently, I was able to run Dread for the group, and it went quite well giving me some traction. Given the groups interest in Star Wars, I've decided to run a session of Paladin in order to give them a good example of what story games have to offer compared to a traditional game like SWSE.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation is not really one of trying to convert from one style to another so much as exploring the spectrum of what's available in order to get some variety that you do not get from solely playing traditional games. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for reading, I actually do get a fair amount of enjoyment from it. Game theory is kind of a hobby of mine, and I've always had a thing for non-linear, interactive narratives so I like to see how people use one to enact the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad to see some things were recommended that I was not aware. Polaris, Smallville, InSpectres, Wushu, Dust Devils, Sorcerer, Mouse Guard, and Trollbabe were already on my radar. However, Archipelago, Lucana, Ghost/Echo, and How We Came to Live Here I totally missed. Granted I recognize some of the names from skimming the forums, but they didn't "mean" anything to me yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, regarding the relevance of Sorcerer. What I meant is, is it still the best example of XYZ, or has another game done the same thing better? I'm fairly certain that its historical significance remains in a similar fashion to White Box D&amp;D.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the feedback everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333709/#Comment_333709" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T20:10:30+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  8:10PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, more recommendations came in while I was typing that response, and upon rereading the thread I see that missed some on the first read through.

Playing a lot of games is a really, really great way to find games you think are good. <br/><br/>My standard advice is that if you can't find players who want to play what you want to play, make some new players. If you already have a core of people who have been dispersed by the closing of your store, that's a bunch of likely candidates who don't even need to be created out of non-gamers.<br/><br/>Failing that, or as a companion to that, see if you can get yourself to a regional convention where you can gorge on games that interest you and others you don't know about yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333715/#Comment_333715" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T21:49:58+00:00" title="July  9, 2011  9:49PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/creamaliengames/Home/kagematsu-the-rpg" rel="nofollow">Kagematsu</a>, easily in my top 5.

There are several examples (in the UK) of people organising grass-roots mini cons and gaming groups without the support of FLGSs. <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=10792" rel="nofollow">PubCon</a>, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-RPG-Meetup-Group/" rel="nofollow">London Indie RPG Meetup</a>, and the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Milton Keynes RPG club</a> (and the MKRPG's <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow</a> con) are examples where people are successfully growing communities of gamers. <br/><br/>But I don't want to threadjack any further.

Flashbacks and competing for rank both were nice ideas toward that.<br/><br/>Dust Devils is still my favorite game for laying out a very simple "get paid for your character's central conflict" type thing. Terrific teaching game to get trad players into that head space. The Devil is just great. <br/><br/>Burning Wheel is enormously more nuanced than Dust Devils and you have to have quite a lot of rules mastery to get there (via engineering moldbreaker opportunities within your BITs), but that's probably the best-in-class I've found for playing deeply conflicted, literary-seeming characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Buckley" title="Sean Buckley"><img alt="Sean Buckley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/b/c/c/member_12459884.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Buckley">Sean Buckley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333882/#Comment_333882" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T12:09:19+00:00" title="July 11, 2011 12:09PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread needs a big flowchart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333930/#Comment_333930" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T20:01:36+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  8:01PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sean, everything needs a good flow chart.

Because trad gamers don't generally care about mechanics, or don't care about them in well-informed ways*, don't try to advertise the indie-ness, just focus on how "It's just like Starship Troopers!" (3:16) or "it's a lot like Redwall" (Mouse Guard).  From my experience that's much more helpful than trying to give people a sort of curriculum or order in which to play indie games.  (Though obviously for people interested in the history of indie game design it's maybe cool to have some knowledge of the trends and the direction of the influence arrows.)<br/><br/>For my money, I think all you <i>really</i> need are Mouse Guard for a GM'd game with heavier mechanics, PTA (or maybe My Life With Master) for a GM'd game with lighter mechanics, Polaris (or maybe 1,001 Nights**) for a rotating-GM or GM-ful game, and one of Jason Morningstar's games for a GM-less game.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Yeah yeah I'm going to get a ton of flames for that sentence, but it's still true.<br/>**Haven't seen that game mentioned elsewhere in the thread, I don't think\u2014it's brilliant.  I really hope Meg writes another game someday because 1,001 Nights is super distilled mega-awesomeness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334576/#Comment_334576" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T22:52:49+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 10:52PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would read a bunch more novels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334582/#Comment_334582" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T23:38:27+00:00" title="July 14, 2011 11:38PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>This is more of an academic interest than anything else.
