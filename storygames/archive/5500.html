I really like it's combat mechanics and I figured that things like social skills (which are not present in Inquisitor for the most part, seeing how it's a narrative wargame) could be left to roleplay, so I hacked it to work with my post-fantasy setting. My players and I are really enjoying it, but I see the whole thing as being oddly successful, seeing as how my group plays it more like a tabletop RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave any of you managed an odd hack like this? What system was it and what did you change? Was it successful?

It was heavily influenced by the music of RUSH and movies like "Cyborg" and "Six-String Samurai."<br><br>It actually worked surprisingly well. There were rules in an issue of Dragon Magazine for doing multiple attacks, so we used that for two-weapon fighting. The only problem was one brief fight lasted nearly an hour because of the main character's ability to choose multiple strike areas and defend multiple strike areas. When he met a mutant orc with a similar ability, it was a really pitched battle, but took forever to complete. We ended up abandoning the game after several sessions that resolved little in the way of storyline.<br><br>ME                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123451/#Comment_123451" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T12:45:20+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 12:45PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done hacking for this and that, but the most successful "crossovers" that I've been a part of were:<br/><br/>Eric P running Shadowrun but with his "rules stream-lines": It's essentially Shadowrun, with dice pools and most of the original rules, but with a far faster startup-into-play ratio.<br/>Taking the Conan novels and running them with The Riddle of Steel.<br/>Taking the novel series "Night Watch" and adapting it to the With Great Power game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
