Usually this was done via creative arithmetic, but a few times I took out an eraser and just awarded my character a few hundred XP at home.  And then, surprise surprise, when that weekend's 514xp award came along, I <i>just happened</i> to be only 428xp away from a level, and was as happy as a clam.<br/><br/>I would also "forget" to apply some modifiers from time to time, so that if no one spoke up my chance of hitting the bad guy could be just that tiny bit higher.<br/><br/><br/>I actually still feel kind of guilty about all of that.  I know it didn't actually harm anyone at all, but still, I probably shouldn't have done it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301042/#Comment_301042" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T16:11:14+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  4:11PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2010 5:56PM by jenskot.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Roll each d10 separately. <br/><br/>If I don't like the first d10 result, roll the second d10 into the first hoping for a new result!<br/><br/>This was after failing Read Latin (which was an 80% skill) for the 6th time and the GM waiting for me to try again otherwise we wouldn't get that 1 clue we needed to move forward and he wouldn't just give it to us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301044/#Comment_301044" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T16:29:58+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  4:29PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the closest I've come is forgetting (or not being able to read my character sheet) if I've used a spell or spent some gold and taking the convenient answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301048/#Comment_301048" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T16:45:16+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  4:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regular GM's dice fudging.

And cheating was rampant. The GMs were leading everyone down a specific path and needed players to succeed to move forward. The amount of times I saw... make a skill check... ok, you failed... anyone else want to try? ok... another failure... make a knowledge roll.... make an idea roll... make a luck roll... anyone else? <br/><br/>It's unclear to me why rolls you can't fail were rolls at all. Even if you wanted to roll for it, there are rules in later editions for skill modifiers (doubling your percentage chance if something is easy or having it if it's hard) but no one used them. GMs I asked said they learned how to play not from the rule books but from the modules and many of the modules would often call for skill checks that many would normally assume would be an automatic success. It became part of the culture.<br/><br/>Quickly, players realized that succeed or fail, the story was going to be the same. And the GM wanted you to succeed but didn't want to just give it to you as if to preserve the illusion of choice or chance. So players started doing the same. If it was obvious GMs needed you to succeed, players would cheat so they could move forward down the GM or module's plot. This was much less disruptive than going down the path of skill check -&gt; group skill check -&gt; knowledge check -&gt; idea check -&gt; luck check. <br/><br/>And GB Steve nailed it exactly. Since so many skills in Call of Cthulhu are about what you know, it's hard to justify failure unless there are outside complications. Why does my University Professor who's the top 10 authority in Latin Language studies keep failing rolls to read a letter written in Latin? If the GM doesn't provide an outside reason, and keeps making you roll... it destroys any suspension of disbelief. CoC games often turned from horror into comedy. And you didn't care if your character died because a bumbling professor who can barely function at their specialty ad nauseum loses sympathy.<br/><br/>So CoC players started cheating the way a D&amp;D DM would cheat behind their DM screen to keep the adventure from falling apart. It was amazing to watch!<br/><br/>Why did we keep playing? CoC games seemed to attract the best roleplayers. After getting past the above, it was almost always a guaranteed good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301136/#Comment_301136" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T08:28:45+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  8:28AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Roll each d10 separately.<br/><br/>If I don't like the first d10 result, roll the second d10 into the first hoping for a new result!<br/></blockquote>\nAh, dice bowling!

I'm not sure I agree with it entirely (I'm enough of a nerd to enjoy talking about whether the rules are working or not and what we could do to make them work better), but it does make me realize that I really don't care if anyone at the table is cheating, so long as they're doing a good job of it.  People in our group roll out in the open all the time, and do I ever look at what they're rolling?  Fuck no.  They can pretty much say whatever they like, and I'll never know.  I don't look at their character sheets to see if they really have the skill bonus they claim to, I don't check their math unless they're doing it out loud, I don't keep track of how much experience points they have or what their character is carrying...none of that matters to me, as long as I'm never forced to think, "There is absolutely no god-damned way that makes any sense at all."<br/><br/>Which means as long as they never roll suspiciously well-timed natural 20s one right after the other, or claim to be masters of seventeen different areas of expertise, or anything else that brings down that particular pretend building, I'm cool with it.  Give yourself extra XP if you feel like it.  Add a dot of something if you need to.  Claim a success when you should have failed.  Work on your trick dice-throwing skills, go dice-bowling, whatever.  It's all the same to me as long as you're not being ridiculous about it.  I'm not going to try to catch you cheating, so as long as you don't make a big deal out of cheating, we're good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301177/#Comment_301177" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T16:47:27+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  4:47PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Creative accounting with regards to encumbrance.

I was occasionally intentionally bad with this book keeping, primarily out of frustration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301181/#Comment_301181" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T18:33:08+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  6:33PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I want a roleplaying game where "cheating" is an okay part of the game as long as you don't get caught.

A card tells you to draw 5, you draw 4, quickly before anyone can count. Sit on your cards when nobody's looking. Give someone more cards than they should get. Throw down similar but non-legit cards and hope nobody notices (6 instead of a 9).<br/><br/>Munchin does this explicitly. It says in the rules you can (and probably should) cheat, as long as you're not caught. If you are, the other players can probably punish you however they like. So you carry two big items, put on a wizard's hat even if you'r not a wizard, hold more cards than you should etc...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301210/#Comment_301210" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T02:48:27+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  2:48AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2010 2:49AM by Graham.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've cheated in GUMSHOE.

Post-roll spend is the gentle version, perhaps not suited to horror games. It's only cheating if you do it and no one else does, and they don't know you are doing it.<br/><br/>I don't consider fudging die rolls in AD&amp;D and similar games as a GM as cheating - it's even explicitly permitted. PCs are fragile up to about 5th level in AD&amp;D, and so I might reduce damage a little, or fail a creature saving throw after a run of bad luck. They still die quite frequently. After 5th level, I'll roll in the open and not change anything significant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302017/#Comment_302017" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T19:41:10+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  7:41PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Roll each d10 separately.</blockquote>\nI totally did this, probably in high school, probably in CoC, maybe in some Palladium games, too.
