"Skill challenges" here are like those designed in 4e, with an attempt at getting X of successes before Y failures. The skill challenge system as devised was scarcely functional, and it underwent a handful of revisions, none of which provided a satisfactory resolution to the problem at hand.<br/><br/>Chief among the problems associated with the skill challenge system was that it did not provide proper guidance on how GMs should engage with the players and the fiction. The system-as-written (distinct from system-as-intended) demanded players roll one d20 after another while seeking ways to shoehorn in their highest skill bonus. A sharp disparity in the usefulness of skills exacerbated this (compare the broadness of Diplomacy to Endurance or Heal).<br/><br/>There remains a kernel of a good idea in there. What the Skill Challenge does properly:<br/><br/>1. It automatically scales by number of players. You can do a Skill Challenge with two players, you can do it with ten. The successes and failures are all that matter.<br/><br/>2. It provides a framework for handling non-combat encounters.<br/><br/>What the system lacks is:<br/><br/>1. Appropriate stakes-setting.<br/><br/>2. Escalation of consequences.<br/><br/>3. Methods and guidance for bypassing the dice roll (player skill vs. character skill).<br/><br/>I propose that the system also needs narrative fine-tuning. Big, important conflicts need more granularity than talking your way past the town guard.<br/><br/>One might structure this for a simple conflict as:<br/><br/>Success: [ ] [ ] [ ]<br/>Failure: [ ] [ ]<br/><br/>The goal is to get three successes before two failures. Three successes equals INTENT SUCCESS, two failures equals INTENT FAILURE, appropriate stakes set beforehand. The system is easy enough as a baseline, but I'd like to see a bit more mechanical crunch to it.<br/><br/>Success [R]: [ ] [ ] [ ]<br/>Success: [B]: [ ] [ ]<br/>Failure: [ ] [C] [ ]<br/><br/>Here we have some additional notation. R refers to required successes. B refers to a bonus success. C refers to a consequence. Players must fill up the R boxes to accomplish their intent. Once they have done so, they can choose to end the Skill Challenge immediately...or, if they're feeling lucky, they can try their hand at the Success [B] boxes. Filling up those boxes will grant them an exceptional success...but they're risking failure in the process. The [C] box indicates at which point the players encounter a Consequence (a negative side effect of their actions), that will not result in INTENT FAILURE.<br/><br/>Hmm. Still thinking on this one.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV" title="NovanIV"><img alt="NovanIV" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NovanIV">NovanIV</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463360/#Comment_463360" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-15T19:33:54+00:00" title="May 15, 2017  7:33PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvOeqDpkBm8" rel="nofollow">Matt Colville did a pretty nice video on skill challenges a while back.</a>  I watched it a bit ago, and I don't have the time to rewatch it right this moment, but the key points that I recall were:<br/><br/>A single player could only roll a given skill once.  That same player could later roll a different skill, or a different player could roll that same skill, but once Bob the Wizard rolled his Arcana skill, Bob could not roll arcana again until after the skill challenge.  This keeps Bob from making all the rolls if his Arcana is highest skill bonus out of any one.<br/><br/>Making them describe what they were doing every time, ESPECIALLY for non-obvious skills.  Along with this he mentions to actually say NO when what they want to do doesn't make much sense or is too much of a stretch (this keeps them grounded in the fiction for using their highest bonus)<br/><br/>Each single failure has a penalty, not just the one that fails the skill challenge.  He gives some examples of getting hit by falling debris, or more guards being mustered for a fight later on, but you likely could get even more narrative if you wanted to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463362/#Comment_463362" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-15T20:02:00+00:00" title="May 15, 2017  8:02PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding is pretty much that the 4th edition skill challenge doesn't really have anything fundamentally wrong with it except for the fact that it relies on group skill in conducting meaningful fictional play to a much greater degree than the miniatures chess combat portion of the game does; this seems to cause confusion, then, when players are thrown from one subgame to the other: not only does the topic and the mechanical style of play change, but you also move from "RAW or death, fiction is totally secondary" to "you actually got to have a meeting of the minds to make this work" all of a sudden.<br/><br/>The practical difficulty seems to specifically come in in the form of shoehorning that big skill bonus, as you described it: the only way for this kind of conflict resolution system to be non-trivial is for the group to be able to agree on how the appropriate skill challenge is derived from the fiction, and do it in a way where the fiction really matters, so that characters are occasionally forced to have difficulties due to lacking skills. Whether you get this by sophisticated group commitment to the fiction or a dominant GM who decides what needs to be rolled doesn't matter for the system nearly as much as the fact that some solution helps the game be more than "I roll my Climbing skill until we pass or fail".<br/><br/>For an example of a game that basically uses the same conflict resolution system, consider <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>: it generally does not suffer from the same cultural difficulties that 4th edition does due to the context being different. The players of TSoY generally assume that the fiction matters, and they take more responsibility for the cohesion of the proceedings, while 4th edition tends to encourage an infantilized play culture where the players have well-defined rights and basically no responsibilities; this means that something simple like agreeing that this situation really isn't a Climbing situation can become quite a chore to negotiate, as the player may not necessarily think that they have any onus to be reasonable or fair or care about the fiction making sense - in the worst case you just demand your rights and may even try bashing the GM with the rules if he tries to get in your way.<br/><br/>Regardless of that, though, I do have one concrete suggestion about the 4th edition skill challenge conflict resolution system: if the idea of "failure" was made more flexible and mechanically concrete, such that it were up to the adventurers to continue pushing their luck in the face of an increasingly unfavourable consequences, I believe that the entire thing would work more reliably and feel less impossible to balance. We can already see this in many practical applications in various adventures written for the game. For example, perhaps the failed task check results in 1d6 points of damage, or you lose X money for it, or a week of time is wasted, or you take penalties to future tries, and it's up to you to decide whether you dare to continue trying. You can still have however many "free failures" available as seems necessary to balance the math, and of course nothing prevents one from assigning the consequences of skill challenge failure on a case-by-case basis: "If you decide to roll Sneaking here, the failure consequence will be a combat encounter; if you'll try to bribe the security forces instead, it costs you money plus on failure you've revealed your presence in the city to the enemy."<br/><br/>I suppose that when it comes down to it I don't really quite see the need to track failures at all for the formal purpose of conflict resolution; just assign a reasonable consequence for each individual task failure and count successes to know when the challenge is complete, that could work just as well - the PCs may continue suffering failures as long as they can stand it, and it's up to the players to decide when to call it off.<br/><br/>(What I suggest is, of course, the standard structure you see in Forgite games that use task-based conflict resolution like this: in TSoY you pay for failed rolls with injury levels until you dare not or can not go on any longer, in Trollbabe you progress to ever-more drastic failure modes at every decision to press on, and so on. It's simple and it works, the 4th edition text just messes up some particular details of the execution due to some other interests it's got going on.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463381/#Comment_463381" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T16:12:13+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  4:12PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Regardless of that, though, I do have one concrete suggestion about the 4th edition skill challenge conflict resolution system: if the idea of "failure" was made more flexible and mechanically concrete, such that it were up to the adventurers to continue pushing their luck in the face of an increasingly unfavourable consequences, I believe that the entire thing would work more reliably and feel less impossible to balance.

When I encountered skill challenges in a 4e game, it felt rather loose and meaningless. I should like a system that could handle a more robust array of skill challenges, framing them in specific guidelines. The devil's in the details, after all--one can boil PbtA games down into "mere" 6-, 7-9, and 10+ resolution, but the moves themselves direct and inform gameplay.<br/><br/>I do like your suggestion of not tracking individual failures beyond the freebies; advising of potential consequences and allowing the players to gauge risk/reward seems like an excellent compromise that minimizes tracking.<br/><br/>Some things I am thinking is that consequences should get harder (in the "hard move" sense) as the conflict wears on. Consider a chase scene involving a player (or players) fleeing from Jason Voorhees.<br/><br/>Failures could involve things like:<br/><br/>\u2022 You see a shadow moving out of the corner of your eye.<br/><br/>\u2022 Heavy footfalls crunch branches underfoot nearby.<br/><br/>\u2022 Jason makes a physical appearance. Every failure from here on out will result in suffering harm. 1-harm to start, with gradually escalating harm as the situation becomes more dire.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, exactly, as I'd like to see a system used during lengthy and potentially dangerous wilderness journeys, not unlike The One Ring's system (albeit marginally less complex).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463382/#Comment_463382" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T16:27:40+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  4:27PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a dramatic perspective, that's very satisfying, I think. That's what I would do if put on the spot and I had to run 4th D&amp;D:<br/><br/>* You can roll as many times as you want, but with each roll, the consequences of failure get a little worse.<br/><br/>This is interesting, in part, because it encourages the group to define, in more detail, what's happening and how it's being done.<br/><br/>It's fairly clear that a failure on an attempt to intimidate a lone guard might be quite different from an attempt to slip inside a jail cell, for instance, so there's some momentum in play, encouraging the group to negotiate these details before the dice hit the table. (As a GM, I'd like to know what the players are up to, so I can create a sensible failure result in response. As a player, I'd like to nail down some details so that I have a clear sense of the risks involved in what I'm trying to do. This puts us on the same page, giving us both an interest in clarifying what exactly is happening in the imaginary space.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463388/#Comment_463388" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-16T19:23:05+00:00" title="May 16, 2017  7:23PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My interest in this came up from the potential opportunity to adapt mechanics in a way that emphasizes narrative lens, zooming in and out of scenes based on importance.

Having a rough time nailing down the exact mechanics. The basics I'm thinking of are:<br/><br/>1. Conflicts require three successes.<br/><br/>2. One failure is a freebie. The rest entail complications, consequences, or concessions.<br/><br/>3. Players can continue to push their luck after the first failure indefinitely.<br/><br/>The C's are basically "GM moves" that pertain to the situation. As an example, when traveling across a savannah, the GM might have the following special moves:<br/><br/>\u2022 Expose them to the elements.<br/><br/>\u2022 Obstruct their path forward.<br/><br/>\u2022 Make a display of nature's majesty.<br/><br/>That's in addition to other moves, of course. All of these things need to tie into some sort of resource management system that can handle a variety of situations. Upon discussing this, I'm afraid I'm veering into Mouseguard territory and thus reinventing the wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
