                    I put this in directed self promo, as it's a bit self indulgent...

Rather than derail that thread with a total tangent, I thought I'd comment here and open things up a bit here. Not just for discussing how well that would play, but to harness the awesome power of the Story Games Hivemind to suggest other, more obscure, truisms to play with. <br/><br/>For those not familiar with the game, in game prep you pick three truisms for your character, in the style of those off hand comments from conspiracy dramas. Then during play you set up situations that call their truth into question...<br/><br/>My thoughts, with a bit of a tweak, I think it'd do great, "You never catch all your mistakes" is pure Covenant gold. Set for great scenes about mistakes coming back to haunt you, or not...                </div>
