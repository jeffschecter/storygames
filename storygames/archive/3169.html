The room is being sponsored by <a href="http://www.endgameoakland.com" rel="nofollow">EndGame</a>, and I'm coordinating its, er, stocking on their behalf.<br/><br/>I'm looking to fill 4 and 6 hours slots.  There would be three games going on in the room, or at least that's the plan.<br/><br/>The slots are:<br/><br/><b>Friday</b><br/>2 pm - 8 pm / 4 pm - 8 pm<br/>8 pm - 12 am<br/><br/><b>Saturday</b><br/>8 am - 2 pm / 8 am - 12 pm<br/>2 pm - 8 pm / 12 pm - 4 pm and 4 pm / 8 pm<br/>8 pm - 12 am<br/><br/><b>Sunday</b><br/>8 am - 2 pm / 8 am - 12 pm<br/>2 pm - 8 pm / 12 pm - 4 pm and 4 pm / 8 pm<br/>8 pm - 12 am<br/><br/><b>Monday</b><br/>8 am - 2 pm / 8 am - 12 pm<br/><br/>Running a single 6 hr timeslot or two 4 hr slots gets you free admission to the 'Con.  <br/><br/>Folks can contact me directly to coordinate their events.  I'm happy to take a generic sign-up to reserve the slot, and a fuller game description can be provided a little later.<br/><br/>I'd love to get a wide variety of games booked.  If we can get some GMs signed up early, we can do some early publicity.  It also helps folks like EndGame and others stock, as games which are demo'd tend to move a little more.<br/><br/>Additionally, support materials from any publishers out there would be appreciated.  Anything from fliers through schwag.  Podcast interviews and seminars are also options for designers / publishers as well.<br/><br/>Feel free to drop me a line at brian -dot- isikoff -at- gmail.com.<br/><br/>Thanks all!<br/><br/>Brian                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73706/#Comment_73706" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T20:30:49+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  8:30PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Howdy All,<br/><br/>I just wanted to give this a bit of a bump. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>   I know Labor Day seems pretty far off right now, but we're hoping to schedule things in advance and reduce the last minute rush.<br/><br/>So far, we've gotten one GM to sign up for a few spots (thanks, Paul Strack) in addition to myself.<br/><br/>We'd also like to make sure there's a table with fliers and such to promote the wide assorted of s-g game -  so if you've got a book out but can't make it to the show, we'd still like to tell folks about your game.<br/><br/>Many thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
