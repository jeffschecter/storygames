Fiasco has been an excellent guide; one of the keys seems to introduce a mechanic that establishes an immediate bond that PCs can't block, which is done superbly by just suggesting an interesting one through the random tables of the setup. The other is to add a mechanic that introduces some sort of conflict that is mostly done indirectly: each PC ends up with two powerful drives related to two other characters. The moment a player starts to move, it does things that drag the others into action either if they like it or not.<br/><br/>Loaded questions can work too but it's tricky to make good ones, and usually you will end up with too few good ones to help the game's replayability. Also, they feel like a heavy imposition for the player. Even if the player gets to chose from a list it always feels more like "choosing your own poison". I mean, well, players can totally go for it once they are on the right frame of mind about the game but it's a bit counterintuitive. Nobody gears their own challenges too well.<br/><br/>Can't recall exactly but I think Shinobigami does it in a simpler way. It has these fronts that are at war at each other, Players don't know who belong to each front as their characters keep these allegiance in secret. Their characters are friends or have other relationship to the players sitting next to them. Their fronts give them common objectives and as scenes progress they discover each other's hidden identity and must choose between friendship or their duty to their front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463226/#Comment_463226" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T09:38:04+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  9:38AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lasers and Feelings                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty" title="frenzykitty"><img alt="frenzykitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/557/n6V5J0A17A1B2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty">frenzykitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463230/#Comment_463230" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T12:52:10+00:00" title="May 10, 2017 12:52PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            KARMA does this in a very clean and quick way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463236/#Comment_463236" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T17:16:24+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  5:16PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very fond of Fiasco's setup. <i>In a Wicked Age...</i> is a gold standard classic for this, as well.<br/><br/><i>While the World Ends</i> allows you to do it as you play, which is really, really cool.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" rel="nofollow">WarriorMonk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The other is to add a mechanic that introduces some sort of conflict that is mostly done indirectly: each PC ends up with two powerful drives related to two other characters. </p></div></blockquote>\nI'm curious about how you do this.

I mean, it's easier to get inspiration from relationships as these inspire emotional bonds. The key with objects and locations is to add an emotional bond between those and the characters, otherwise, I agree with you, nothing comes up from rolling those. <br/><br/>So, if you rolled "your father's watch" you should think of it as butch's watch in Pulp Fiction: it's something that gave you an emotional scar and yet you keep it because it's the last connection you have with your father. If you roll a fancy car, you go at it like Clint Easwood in Gran Torino: the car means a lot to you in many more ways than just how much it cost you; you did something to get it and feel like you really deserve it. Or maybe it's such a big part of your identity that you're nothing without that car. That's when objects and locations really click and become Drives, though there's not much in the game to explain you how that part works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463238/#Comment_463238" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T17:45:43+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  5:45PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2017 5:47PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what a story game is but Bonds in <i>Dungeon World</i> and their equivalent in <i>AW2</i> seem to work well to tie people together quickly and simply.

I define Story Games the same way Ben Robbins does; you can read his definition here if you are unaware or interested:<br/><a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/460/defining-story-games/</a><br/>Sometimes I foolishly think everyone understands what I mean by Story Games on this forum because I've talked about it at length...of course, this is silly.

I'm especially interested in your ideas regarding Needs and thoughts about expanding there interpreting them more widely in set up; I've been experimenting with a similar idea, in a game I'm creating, which is inspired by them.

In my publication I will state this and I will recommend that gamers purchase these great games. If Ben and Jason would like me to modify any of the procedures I will be glad to do so.  Also, these ideas are being developed with play testing so they will likely change).<br/><br/>Here is how the setup works:<br/><br/>Players share Relationships, these are shared with the players to the left into the right of them. They also add a complication to these relationships based on their characters Desires. These are made up by the players.  The characters don't necessarily have to know each other.  Here are how Desires work and examples:<br/><br/><b>The players have a secret that could affect the players' standing in society or in an important fraction of society such as an important organization or faction. They want to keep this secret hidden</b>:<br/><br/>The brother and sister are incest and this is a secret.<br/> <br/>The players are frenemies, who don't trust each other, and are part of an alliance that  secretly betrayed the king. <br/><br/>(The societal secrets can be at cross purposes and the players do not have to know each other, as long as there is the potential of social fall out if either of the players are discovered). For example:<br/><br/>Two spies who are spying for one another's  opposite and competing houses.<br/><br/><br/><b>The players have competing desires:</b><br/><br/>The players are in love with the same woman.<br/><br/>The players both want to be king.<br/><br/>The players both want to seek revenge on the same person. <br/><br/><b>The players desire something from one another:</b><br/><br/>One player wants to reclaim their family's heirloom sword that it's been passed down for generations. One player wants to revenge his fathers death, which was ordered by the other player.<br/><br/>One player wants to earn the others respect. One player wants to sabotage the other player.<br/><br/><b>The players desire the same thing:</b><br/><br/>Both players want to steal the King's Jewels.<br/><br/>Both players want to flip the member of rival house, to spy for their house and to advance their houses agenda.<br/><br/>I would be happy to hear any feedback about these procedures and how effective you all think they would be.

I've only played Archipelago once, and I'm not sure if I thought of the elements as exclusionary, at least not to the same extent.  Maybe I didn't read the rules closely enough <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> It definitely gives the elements a lot of import and something to focus and guide the story.

I don't think there's a question of anything being "exclusionary"; it's just that the choice not to include something as a "setting element" sends a pretty strong message. It shows us - collectively - that this element isn't central or important; it shows us that we are willing to handle it however we like, but it's not a linchpin of any importance in our story.<br/><br/>Jeff, I can't quite make heads or tails of what your actual process or procedure is from your description, but I really like the way it's heading.

I think, as of now, it very likely is overkill as you say; but, this is a House of Spiders we're talking about, so this is why I probably over did it <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/>\u2014with that said, I have also suspected it was overkill and have already come up with simple adjustment I can make during the playtesting process, to remedy this, which I will discuss below. Basically, it involves reducing the number of complicating desires you have with other players' characters. You do this by sharing a complicating desire with just one other player's character instead of two. If this doesn't make sense don't worry, I will explain it more below.<br/><br/>As of now, every character has a complication in their relationships with two other characters. The character to the left of the player and the character to the right of the player. These complications are based on desires, goals, secrets etc, as you say (fundamentally they are just different types of conflicting or mutual desires, or desires at more subtle cross-purposes). So pretend I'm a player and during setup I'm choosing the types of complicated desires my character has with the characters to the left and the right of me, and we decide the following as players:<br/><br/>I am the brother of the character to my right; the character to the right is my sister. We are incest and desire to keep this a secret.<br/><br/>&amp; <br/><br/>The character to the left and I are strangers. I killed that character father and possess his magnificently well-crafted, heirloom sword, my desire is to keep the sword of my greatest enemy and to perhaps hand it down to my own son one day. The character to my right, who's father was killed by my character has been searching for this sword his whole life so that he could recognize the man who killed his father and avenge his death.<br/><br/>In my post above, I was trying to list the types of desire complications (though not exhaustively) that are chosen by different characters, because characters must choose category types of desires. For example, one character would have to choose a mutual desire the with the other character; another character whould have to choose a competing desire with the other; one group would have to choose to desire something from one another; and so on. In the above post, I tried to list some of these categories of desire; but again, not exhaustively. <br/><br/>I hope the explanation above gives you a better understanding of how this phase of the setup works. Please let me know if you would like further qualifications.

Certainly, having all that juicy content makes things a lot easier to come up with something good, but when all the cards are down, there's quite a lot of information to synthesize.  I've seen groups split between active suggesters and the rest going, "I dunno.."<br/><br/>I really, really like The Quiet Year's iterative building process. It's really good at sharing out the act of being the creator, which seems to help everyone get invested in the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463754/#Comment_463754" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-07T22:48:52+00:00" title="June  7, 2017 10:48PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2017 10:58PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" rel="nofollow">Kenny_J</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">@Jeff_B_Slater</a> <br/>I'm very interested in this secrets and competing desires portion of the <i>House of Spiders</i> setup.

If you're interested in using it for your own personal use, you can message me and I'd be glad to send you some more details <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> On the off chance, you end up wanting to use the procedures in a game you intend to publish, I would prefer that you wait to do so until after House of Spiders' publication. I know that this sounds a little bit silly and even paranoid\u2014at best needlessly cautious\u2014but I'm working very hard on the game and I feel the game has the potential to be innovative in a lot of ways. I want the game to be excellent and I'm doing everything in my power to make sure that it is; because of this, play testing is going to take a very, very long time. I want to own House of Spiders, whether it is a success or failure. In other words, I take this stuff way too seriously, haha. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> Once it's published, I would be very happy, as well as unusually fortunate, to see it influence other games; and  of course, flattered and proud to have other designers use it in the games they publish. Anyway, I'm ranting and this is likely much ado about nothing.<img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> Send me a message and I'll gladly hook you up <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463756/#Comment_463756" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-08T02:30:39+00:00" title="June  8, 2017  2:30AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No worries I totally get it!

The game is card-based, so there are a bunch of "draw" tables in the book or you can use the custom deck I made that contains all the "quickdraw" prompts already on the cards.<br/><br/>First each player draws a card for their concept/personality. Value indicates general archetype (Neophyte, Wanderer, Leader, Fool...), and suit indicates approach (Caring, Professional, Selfish, Volatile).<br/><br/>Then, everyone gets a second card that indicates a relationship they have with one other character. Again, value indicates type (Acquaintances, Colleagues, Rivals, Friends, Relatives...) and suit indicates the mood (as above). You pick another player and make sure they're cool with that relationship, and then the group collaboratively works out how everyone fits together (including further relationships that are implied by the card-based setup). It creates an asymmetrical relationship map, but guarantees that everyone will be connected to at least one other character.<br/><br/>Next, everyone defines something that their character cares deeply about. This might be an important NPC, an item, or even a place or organisation. You can draw for these as well, or just make them up. These are basically the things people will be fighting about.<br/><br/>Once those are established, everyone defines three goals that connect to other characters or those important elements defined in the previous step. Because of the way the rest of the system leverages them, goals are pretty mechanistic and have to fit into a specific form rather than being freeform. By their nature (mostly being to do with controlling or destroying stuff), you tend to end up with a tangled web of conflicting goals.<br/><br/>Lastly, you randomly find out which other character's magic sword your magic sword will try to destroy if it ever manages to gain control over you. I put this last so that the choice of Blade enmity won't influence your character's choice of rivals and enemies, but rather will tend to arbitrarily cut across the characters' relationships and alliances. If you're lucky you might end up with your Blade hating your worst enemy, but it's just as likely it'll try to make you kill your ally, best friend, or parent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
