I'm usually stuck using fairly conventional games for these purposes (Storyteller, d20, 7th Sea, etc.). I'm looking for games which work particularly well for that span of time, with a more indie/story game bent. <br/><br/>One I've played which straddles that divide is <a href="http://artesiaonline.com/blog/?page_id=487" rel="nofollow">Artesia: Adventures in the Known World</a> which has a Tarot inspired character growth system, which while a bit complex offers a tremendous richness to how characters change intentionally and unintentionally. <br/><br/>I'd like to hear about other options. Preferably with play experiences. For example, I'm not sure I'd believe that a game of Burning Wheel can take over a hundred sessions without the system entering into some unusual territory, but if you've experienced otherwise I'd love to hear about it. <br/><br/>I'm not interested in speculations or arguments why folks shouldn't be playing or designing indie/story long form games. If you really want to talk about it, make another thread and I'll offer my perspective. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382916/#Comment_382916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T17:28:00+00:00" title="June 20, 2012  5:28PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sign in Stranger seems optimized for the short end of your long form range.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382946/#Comment_382946" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-20T21:55:11+00:00" title="June 20, 2012  9:55PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about the Zorceror of Zo?

They've now rounded out quite a bit, becoming solidly competent in the areas they're being challenged so far.  From the data I have, I estimate that the characters are logging a usable test each every half hour or so.  Advancement does slow down quite a bit once you reach that level - you need more tests to advance and the obstacles are much higher.  Also, permanent injuries have knocked down one character in a few ways, so it's not uniform improvement.<br/><br/>Just from a numbers perspective, experienced characters are still pretty easy to challenge.  Another game (I'm a player in this one) we're playing 6LP elves that are vastly more potent than the Grunwelders, but we're still highly vulnerable when we're out of our comfort zones.  The Grunwelders can kick ass against B4 mooks, but a couple of mounted knights or a persuasive bishop are still a major challenge.<br/><br/>But from a story perspective, it still feels very fresh.  The players are contributing a lot to the direction of the game, so I'm starting to feel the world deepening in a very exciting way - all the more so because much of what's going on is a ripple from something the players initiated.<br/><br/>Though, we're nowhere near 100 sessions.
