I'm curious to learn more about the sorts of themes, topics, discussions and so on that you have on here.<br/><br/>As this is a beginning for me - oh, and I ought to mention before I go on that I came here because I followed a link from the weekly Roleplaying Tips newsletter I get sent to me by "Johnn Four" - I thought I'd start with beginnings.<br/><br/>How do you select beginnings for your sessions, and for your chronicles or campaigns? What kinds of beginnings do you prefer, to get the characters going - whether in tabletop or in fiction?<br/><br/>Some of my common favourites:-<br/><br/>- <b><i>The Assignment:</i></b> There is a knock on the door of the character's apartment at 3am. He opens the door. Agents friendly to the character are waiting outside. "Put your clothes on and come with me," the leader barks. No discussion. No questions. No chance at refusal. Same deal for all the other players. They are led to a warehouse, and there they meet a patron they trust. He has a mission for them ...<br/><br/>- <b><i>In Medias Res:</i></b> The story begins right in the middle of the action. The first words the Games Master should utter are "Everybody, roll initiative." Part of the back story can be told as narratives, but the action should concentrate on the present.<br/><br/>- <b><i>Beginnings, Subverted:</i></b> The characters think that the adventure is about to be one thing, but they quickly discover that the story is about something else altogether. <i>Example:</i> The characters think that they are about to meet a patron who will give them a job - but when they get to the appointed meet, they find their patron lying dead on the ground with the lead character's favourite dagger protruding from the patron's back. Suddenly, the authorities round the corner, alerted by reports of a struggle and loud screams ...<br/><br/>Although the best kind of beginning, for me, has got to be one where the characters actually strike out to do something for themselves, and then you as Games Master can improvise the challenges they face to make it an adventure for them.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410741/#Comment_410741" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T02:16:02+00:00" title="March 29, 2013  2:16AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found that building up that initial momentum is the hardest part of any campaign. So what I did was, I wrote a game that addressed it! In Other Worlds you have a group worldbuilding phase, so everyone at the table is automatically engaged in what's going on, but importantly one of the steps is 'decide what the first scene will be'. In past campaigns we've had this be a pre-credits action sequence, a Council of Elrond-style debate, an official mission briefing, and the hijacking of the spaceship the characters are on. <br/><br/>Other Worlds also has a thing called prologue abilities - each player invents a temporary trait that describes the character's role and introduction into the first session (kind of like a mechanically significant kicker). Typical examples of this would be 'Masked Men Are Hunting Me', 'I Found a Briefcase Full of Stolen Money', 'My Spaceship Has Just Broken Down', 'I Woke Up Covered in Green Scales and Now Have Super Strength', that kind of thing. Basically it's an initial plot hook that defines why we have chosen this particular moment to start following that character's story.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410742/#Comment_410742" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T02:50:04+00:00" title="March 29, 2013  2:50AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2013 2:53AM by Rickard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use <i>in media res</i>, but not really putting them into action. Instead, I tell them about the assignment or their goal and then put them in a place where they can start to act on the goal. So I kind of skipped the "giving assignment" thing. Sometimes I interleave this into character creation by giving them a list of goals that they have to weave in their characters. Another way of using character creation is to make them make characters from a group theme that the GM have chosen.<br/><br/>I can also put the characters in a place and then ask the players why they are there and how they know each other. It's a technique I ripped off <b>Star Wars d6</b>.<br/><br/>One favourite that I'm careful not to overuse is to start with the final scene and when it's about to be resolved, I cut to the "first scene". I can't remember what this is called in literature.<br/><br/>The last thing that I use in GM free games it to create a relationship map with the other participants. The relationship map is always created around an event or two. A "tilt".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410758/#Comment_410758" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T13:00:20+00:00" title="March 29, 2013  1:00PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2013 1:02PM by Mathalus.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with what soviet said about collaborative worldbuilding. It is my favorite way to start a campaign (except for Lacuna, that\u2019s gotta be IMR). Most newer games have this built in now; the Socratic method in Apocalypse World, creating the world and situation in Burning Wheel, making the world and group in Anima Prime, writing down places and threats in Serpent\u2019s Tooth, etc. For games that don\u2019t, I suggest using Microscope to build the world together. Your campaign will be sickeningly rich and you won\u2019t be able to swing a stick without mad reincorporation. <br/><br/>The main reason for this is player buy-in. When players get to add things to the world from the beginning, you let them help set the tone. Then they are more likely to be excited for and enforce that tone. Then you let them play in this fantastic place that they already think is cool, because they added ideas they thought were cool. <br/><br/>It works so well, sometimes it feels like cheating.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410759/#Comment_410759" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T13:13:21+00:00" title="March 29, 2013  1:13PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "In Medias Res" Is my favorite, hands down. Start with some action, get the players interested in the scene and trying to solve a dilemma right away. As the dust settles start establishing the relationships between the characters, and the world around them.

Everything is kept fairly straightforward, so that you can focus on one element at a time (this is how a skill check works, this is how a fight scene works, here's a chance for you to try out some other mechanic), and then it wraps up with something that's hopefully pretty cool and gets everyone revved up about the premise of the game.<br/><br/>We've done it in two games, the first time with mostly pre-generated characters who later showed up as NPCs, and in the second game with the actual PCs. I was happy enough with the results that I'll likely drag it out again the next time we try a longer game in a brand-new system. It's also not a bad way to lay down some backstory for the setting, without feeling like you're just doing exposition dumps on everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410761/#Comment_410761" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-29T14:06:00+00:00" title="March 29, 2013  2:06PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to do a lot of convention one-shot games, so The Assignment or something similar tends to work well for that.<br/><br/>I enjoyed doing it with Dungeon World, though, and having the players fill in some of the blanks. Sort of like a Mad Libs version of The Assignment, which gave the players a share of ownership over the process while still getting us quickly into an interesting situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
