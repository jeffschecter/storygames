                    OK, it's that time again. Just to recap, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1066&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">here's where it began</a>.<br/><br/>To recap the <b>Intention</b>:<br/><br/>You all know what happened with Battlestar Galacrica. That corny period-piece got not only a facelift, but an entire re-imagination almost from scratch. Most of the character names were the same, and the Cylon Threat remained, but after that it was basically put through some really creative gymnastics, and what emerged was awesome, pure awesome. Well, much of that is the screenwriting and direction, but still, you get my point.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=32872" rel="nofollow">Here's an art project where someone Awesome-O-Fied HE-MAN</a></b> (the anime/action figure line), and was such a jaw-dropper that it directly inspired this line of threads.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was thinking that maybe the same can be done to old D&amp;D (or other) campaign worlds. Take the core ideas that are there, and shake them up. Reimagine them.<br/><br/>To recap the <b>Rules</b>:<br/><br/>If you're tangentially familiar with the setting, join in the brainstorm session.<br/><br/>Just throw out a few ideas (or one) per post. You don't have to write paragraphs, even a sentence or two is ok.<br/><br/>You do not have to build upon yourself (you could say "There are Elves, and they are badass!" and "There are NO Elves!" in the same post, just to throw out some ideas). You can build on your own ideas if you want.<br/><br/>You do not have to build upon the ideas of others; you are absolutely free to contradict or ignore them. You can build on others' ideas if you want.<br/><br/>It's not "group setting creation" so much as simply brainstorming.<br/><br/>Also, feel free to pull things out of Dark Sun that you liked and talk about them (and why you liked them), which can maybe set off some cool ideas.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            I loved the idea of half-dwarves.  Could they get the cylon treatment?  Perhaps there are viable half-dwarves that can breed and secretly pass for "normal" amoung the populace in addition to even cooler CGI sterile Muls.  Riffing on myself, I could see the half-dwarves staging a rebellion/war against their oppressors.<br/><br/>Core to the setting is the destructive nature of magic.  This worked for me, but I never 'groked' the mechanics.  Is there a way/system to make the corrupting effect cooler and more explicit?  Maybe throw in a corruption of the mage aspect as well - I get visions of grotesquely warped mages each different, perhaps one skeletal, another essentially a living hive of chaos insects - something feeling like a mix of Exalted, Ravenloft, and Thundarr the Barbarian.                        </div>

                            Man, this is a tough one. Dark Sun was pretty awesome to start with. I guess you could run it with Iron Heroes; that's been something I've wanted to do since IH came out.<br/><br/>Let's see, half-giants, obsessed dwarves, huge beefy half-dwarves, cannibal halflings, nomadic elves that everyone hates because they constantly lie, bards that use poison, elementalist clerics, renegade wizards, the Sea of Silt, dragon-kings so powerful they grant spells... I can't see anything really <i>bad</i> there. Perhaps if you had more dangerous magic, something that actually caused problems for you personally rather than just wrecking your surroundings?<br/><br/>I'll keep thinking about it.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Dark Sun was one of my favorite DnD settings.  I'm glad this was next on the Awesome list.  It looks like you only want one idea per post, so I'll honor that here.<br/>
<br/>
First thing I'd do is get rid of all the lush and green areas that I felt ruined the game.  The planet is a desert.  Period.  No valley paradise, no woods off in the corner of the map, it's a hot, dry, scorching desert.  That is how the setting impacts play, and in the end it was my favorite part of the idea.  To amplify that, I'd want some simple mechanics that deal with heat exhaustion, sunburn, and dehydration.  I'd also like to have some nifty mystical mechanics revolving around mirages.  Maybe they are portals to another place on the planet.  But the main thing would be to emphasise the desert-ness of the planet and make the PCs content with that.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
<br/>

                            Blue/David, that's totally hot, on both ideas.<br/><br/>First off, I forgot to preface my post above, but I'm totally taking Dark Sun from the Original boxed set; before the Novels, before the setting was Metaplot-ted and rebooted, and before it tanked into suckland. However, if suckland is the Dark Sun that you (the reader) loves, feel free to make the Suck into UnSuck!<br/><br/>So, there's a bunch of City-States and each City-State represents a different culture. I'm thinking that instead there's just ONE Huge, Sprawling city-state that represents basically 5-7 fallen civilizations whose people bound together under one city to survive. That city is ruled by the typical mysterious Dark Sun tyrant oppressor. Everything past the city-state's holdings (farms) is total hostile batshit insane-ville.<br/><br/>Continuing that theme, I'm thinking that there is one City-State, but it's extremely far away. Trade is rare. Rumors of what that other city-state is like abound. Every time a caravan comes in from that city-state the merchants are always totally different than the previous ones, so nothing consistent can be said about "all people from that city-state".

Actually, more than one idea is fine. One idea, a bunch of ideas, conflicting ideas, it's all good. I guess what I meant was "post as little or as much as you want, and feel free to turn right around and Post More if you want".                        </div>

<b>Dark Sun: Manapunk</b><br/><br/>Could you imagine an illusion spell so vast that everyone could see it world-wide? But only if they took this drug over here ... not only does it ameloriate the effects of the suns' heat, but it makes the world look like the lush paradise everyone wished it was. Who needs reality when they can live their day to day lives seeing what the master illusionists create for them to see ... Could you imagine the power that cadre of illusionists would have?

                            Okay I love the idea of "One City-State" and a mysterious "Other City-State".  I don't know what I like more - the idea of traders showing up from the other place - or the idea that "Your Dragon King" is waging war with "Their Dragon King" and that "volunteers" are periodically culled from the populace to go fight the war... Or Are They.<br/><br/>Second, I think Dark Sun: Manapunk is hot.  And explains to me why the species don't just adapt to the desert.  Cause otherwise it seems like you wouldn't need survival rolls because 'people' just get used to the desert over the generations.<br/><br/>Third, GIANTS.  How did I forget about GIANTS.  For me, if I were running Dark Sun: The Awesome (in d20) I would directly port Monte Cook's Giant Race/Class from Arcana Unearthed into the setting/system to replace the Half-Giants.  I think the idea of Giants that grow during the game and that the advancement rules build that in is too cool for words.                        </div>

                            One of the things I thought was weak about Dark Sun was that everyone had a mutant power.  (Excuse me: psionic power.)  (I don't know why D&amp;D needs so many magic systems, but that's another topic.)<br/>
<br/>
The rule for magic in Dark Sun should be: all magic comes from stealing the life-energy of something else.  The Dragon King guys do it by siphoning the life from an entire city's worth of dudes, and spreading it around to their flunkies--who may end up being like vampires, sucking the blood from their king.  And then there are freelancers--the defilers, who steal the energy from other stuff.  And there are druids, who have figured out how to use magic in a helpful way.<br/>
<br/>
All of these guys--the Templars, the Druids, the Defilers--are essentially doing the same stuff, with the same kind of magic, but the means are totally different.                        </div>

<p>I have always imagined a post-Yellow Age Dark Sun, where water is still rare and costly, but it has become the province of the middle class rather than the magical aristocracy.</p>
<p>In this new age of wealth and leisure, homespun wools and animal skins give way to silks and transparent gauzes, and the new weapons are dazzling jewel-colored ceramics.</p>

<br/>
I was a huuuuge dark sun fan as a kid and teenager, and I remember wanting to change a couple of things to the setting even then to make it full of more badassery.  So, as I remember:<br/>
<br/>
When the sundering came, all of the peoples of the world were left with nothing.  Magick robbed them of their lands, their food.  Many women found their wombs unable to hold child.  Milk curdled and seeds turned to dust.  But there were people left behind.  Many people, and those many people that wanted to fight and live found themselves and gathered together.  They created a city-state, Tyr, and lived together, fighting against a dying world for life.  It has been thirteen generations since the sundering of the lands.<br/>
<br/>
The old races are still there: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Thri-kreen.  The common tongue that has developed over the years is a polyglot of all of their languages.  Indeed, there are very few culutural boundaries left between the races.  <br/>
<br/>
All of the races, excluding the Thri-kreen, can have children together, that's why their called races and not species.  Most of those children are born dead, sadly.  Some rare few do live on, sickly and twisted.  All of these half-breeds are called Mul, from the dwarven tongue meaning "bent".  Oddly, the dwarves seem to be the most capable of interbreeding, their children coming out strong, hardy and healthy.  It is rare for Mul to make children, but it has been known to happen on occasion.  The less said of these, the better.  <br/>
<br/>
No gods.  No clerics empowerd by gods.  There are many different strange faiths on this world, but none grant mystical powers.  There is no proof of any god existing.  You are all alone.  <br/>
<br/>
Magic users could syphon life energy from anything that was alive.  Plants, sure, and animals too.  But they could also take from their own bodies, or the worst amongst them would steal lifeforce from other people.  The energy could in no way be stored.  It was through the syphoning and weaving of this energy that magick was created.  <br/>
<br/>
One gigantic city-state.  Huge, sprawling, monstrous.  It's impossible for many people to live in the far-off desert for very long, so the city-state, let's just use Tyr 'cause it's a cool name, must be gigantic.  It houses most of what is left of humanity.  There are plots of land inside of it that have, over a couple of generations, been nursed back enough that they can hold resilient crops like wheat.  Legionnaires guard this land constantly and any caught stealing from it are seen as the worst of criminals, akin to rapists and murderers.  The city is a loud, bustling, vibrant place, full of weird music and alien art and architecture from the many different cultures that were forced to live together when the magic burned up the fertility of the planet.  <br/>
<br/>
Why go outside of the walls of Tyr?  Because there are fortunes to made on the rare bits of gold that can be found there.  There are the remnants of the old civilization to be found.  There are creatures that threaten the borders of Tyr, horrible monsters that attack the farmlands and water supplies.  Because there are still small outposts of people out there that need supplies and may be rich in rare supplies of their own.  Because of those rare people that come to Tyr selling mysterious objects and claiming to come from another city-state well south of Tyr.  Because, in your heart you know there is more.  <br/>
<br/>
Just like in Rome, Gladiators are celebrities.  It is foolish to waste expensive slaves on death in the arenas, so many Gladiators are free men searching out fame and fortune.  Indeed, most Gladiators do not kill in the arenas, though they may beat and break their opponents quite readily.  <br/>
<br/>
Lose the psychic powers.  It dilutes the power of magick.<br/>
<br/>
More about class culture.  Show more of what it's like to live as a slave, a freeman, a merchant, artisan, etc.  Rather than having the rich, the slaves and a vast and muddy middle, discuss more of what is in that cream in the center of the oreo.    <br/>
<br/>
I like what Blue said about the halflings.  Keep that shit around.  <br/>
<br/>
That's all that I've got for now.  Off to work.<br/>

Speaking of Psionics, I'd want to toss that out completely.  Here's why:  The main metaphysical source of power should come from Magic.  The process of using up life to exert force is an issue the PCs should have to deal with- one way or the other.  Psionics bypasses that issue way too neatly for my tatste.  <br/>

<p>I know zilch about Dark Sun, or any of the other settings everyone's awesome-o-fied (which is why I haven't participated,) but: couldn't you keep psionics by saying it's magic that uses up your <em>own</em> life? Which would keep it sufficiently rare: people would prefer to use up someone else's life, instead of their own, so they would turn towards the traditional magical arts.</p>

<br/>
Judd, you and I want the same thing.  To that end, someplace not too far from the gigantic City-State I'd love a huge ruins.  Say, it's archetecture is similar to the big city but on a much much grander scale.  Dust filled wells, abandoned arenas, wizard towers, the whole bit.  Now it would be haunted by spectres and infested with hungry halflings (insert Blue's idea about Halflings being the decendants of human otcasts).  That would be a fun place to explore, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Oh, totally.  That's why the original Dark Sun was awesome (there was always that hint that it was, like, the Forgotten Realms 10,000 years in the future or something; a vanilla fantasy world that got nuked cause too few wanted too much). And incidentally, it's why I hated the Revised/Second Dark Sun set ("Oh, forgot to mention; This planet has its own history, was never a vanilla fantasy world, and only has about 3,000 years of history; Also, all that environmental crap doesn't really mean anything anymore either").                        </div>

                            You know, the thing with "only one city state, and maybe another wayyyy far away"--all that takes, is to take the scale of the setting seriously.  Back in ancient times, trekking across a desert was a serious undertaking that took weeks if not months.  Even into the Middle Ages, most peasants didn't know what was a day or two's travel beyond their village.<br/>
<br/>
Here's something that was already awesome in Dark Sun: the Dragon was one of the kings, until he siphoned off all the life force of his city and became Godzilla.  There's your ruin.                        </div>

<b>Half-Giants</b><br/><br/>I could never buy the "They change alignment daily" thing, because it was so clothed in the terms of that inadequate personality mechanic from AD&amp;D. But I'm at a loss as to what to use to replace it.  I know I DID have this awesome idea a few months ago about how to reinvent/interpret this, but I didn't write it down so it's totally lost now. <br/><br/>Modular personalities? Half-giants have very little sense of individuality on their own. They tend to always be a mirror of what's going on in the people around them: Gladiator HGs are as brutal and boastful as the people around them; just as HG scholars are as calm and perceptive. <br/><br/>Bipolar? The phases of the moon dictate their behavior in this complex, but chartable, flow? <br/><br/>Hmmmm.<br/><br/><b>Templars</b><br/><br/>The most ambitious, self-serving folks become templars. They usually come from the families of the wealthy or priveleged. Very rarely does a well-meaning person strive to be a templar because they see the order as a source of stability and justice (it'slike wanting to join the Empire as an officer so that you can change it from the inside-out).  Little do they know that those who "graduate" get to attend a secret audience with the Sorcerer King... who promptly sucks out their sould and turns their bodies into living containers of his own power. The templars literally are the sorcerer's Eyes and Ears.                        </div>

                            The first thing that struck me when I cracked open the boxed set was the Brom art with all the weird materials. No metal weapons, it's ceramic or bone. Wood and metals are stupid-rare! I'm still a big fan of the whole "no metals or wood, your weapons are crazy weird bone spurs. And if you do find a metal weapon, treat it like it's enchanted".<br/><br/>That and big undead bugs. I'd increase the bug stuff a ton so you can have carapace stuff all over. Rapiers made from sharp antennae or scything bug legs.<br/><br/>The one thing I remember liking from the books (other than gigantic undead bugs) was when the main character gets a magic item <i>embedded</i> into his flesh. It festers and gets all gross. <i>That's</i> the kind of sacrifice you make when you use magic.                        </div>

Survive<br/><br/>Everything about the setting tried to be deadly.  The social and physical environments were harsh.  There was even a suggest that player make a bunch of characters since it was very likely that they would die.                        </div>

                            I recall a game design seminar where John Wick and Jared Sorensen said that "survival" was one of the most common and least effective premises for a game. :P<br/><br/>I don't know anything about Dark Sun, but from what everyone here has been describing, the big hook seems to be the <i>cost</i> of survival. Like, magic has a cost paid by the environment, right? So why the heck would anyone use magic? What can magic get you that nothing else can? Do you need magic to survive?                        </div>

                            Survival is  huge theme in Dark Sun, but yeah it is totally implemented weak:<br/><br/>"Fight killer Monsters! Constantly! In the desert!  Ohh, here come more!"<br/><br/>That, and some dehydration checks. I guess you could implement some Wilderness Survival Guide nuttiness in there and make all sorts of survival and water finding checks... but for what? Most checks won't really result in "If you fail, you DIE" results anyway.<br/><br/>So what DS also needs is some kind of new subsystem for really portraying that gritty "survive outside the city" environment.  I'm thinking some weird kind of Czege-style thing with colorful polyhedrals that each mean something, and use a fotrune-in-the-middle style method of rolling the dice then describing the harsh conditions that happen as one tries to trek from Here to There.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            So we're assuming there is an impetus that makes characters leave the safety of this big giant city? Is this a setting-wide motivation or is it something decided on character creation on an individual basis?                        </div>

                            The original setting was Survive / Smack Down A Sorcerer King.<br/><br/>As we've been brainstorming today, I find myself much more intrigued by the potential for politics and intrigue in the setting.  Half-Dwarves planning rebellion.  Who and where is the Other City-State and why does our Sorcerer King keep it a secret?  Templars who wanted to change things from within and who now may or may not be the soul puppets of the Sorcerer King and/or their struggle to literally maintain thier soul.                        </div>

                            So: in the 3e Fiend Folio, there is an awesome monster that is pure Dark Sun.  It's called an Ulstalaggator (or something.)  It's a colossal undead worm, with genius-level intelligence, with whip-like hairs that rip anything that comes near to shreds.  And it vomits up armies of skeletons.<br/>

I also like the idea of the Garthim from "Dark Crystal"--but as suits of armor, worn by the most bad-ass warriors.                        </div>

                            Water should have a narrative cost.  Rather than "do I make my dehydration check?  what about my forage?" it should be a choice:  take a point of Con damage from thirst, or drink the blood of the raider you killed.  Or beat the horses to get you to the outpost on time.  Or trade your mother's ring for a canteen.  Or steal one from your lover.  Or cast a spell, and let the world pay the cost.                        </div>

If this doesn't get you psyched about Dark Sun, nothing will. As one of the commentors says, "This is awesome. I want to play a Mul Gladiator that wears a sequined mask and calls himself El Destructore."<br/>

                            So... what if magic isn't tied to some ephemeral mystical life energy? Maybe I'm just jaded when it comes to fantasy magic, but it always seemed very invisible and new agey. That doesn't seem to fit this world at all, so what if it's tied to that which is most obviously lacking in a desert? What if magic is <i>literally</i> water? When you absorb magical power from a living thing, it comes out in a cloud of mist. You need a little bit of water just to survive, because water is literally life, but if you have some <i>extra</i> water, that grants magic and the ability to restore.                        </div>

                            Cloud of mist, Daniel? Dude, cloud of <span style="color: red;">blood</span>. <br/><br/>As for the Thri-kreen, you could always make them the ones in charge. You can keep the dragon kings, their templars, etc., and just make them all into Thri-kreen. They're the Old Race, the ones who discovered magic and psionic power. They're the people who grew all those other giant beetles and thick-carapaced insectoid monsters that Dark Sun loves. When things started turning bad, they rounded up their food source and trapped them in the cities.<br/><br/>I think that running Dark Sun in D&amp;D 3.5 would require removing all the heavy-damage psionic powers. These days psionics and magic are nigh unto identical in terms of what they can do, but back in AD&amp;D psionics had a very different feel, with only 2-3 damaging powers in the whole book. (Admittedly, in 2nd ed. you could get Disintegrate as a 3rd level character, but let's fix that one up, shall we?) Keep the 3.5 psi rules, scrap all the damaging powers, reinstitute the psi/magic difference, and give everyone a free level of Psion, Psychic Warrior, or Wilder, that's what I say.                        </div>

                            I think (unsurprisingly, this is always my answer to these threads), that Judd has it right in that all DS needs is to be played with a better system. I would, of course, use Hero Quest, but that's just me. The point is that DS is already awesome, it's just defined with a system that doesn't evoke it's awesomeness well.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>Anyone want to tackle Thri-kreen?  Personally, I never cared for them but I know they are quite iconic to Dark Sun.  Any ideas of the insect people of the desert planet?</blockquote>
What if they're emphasised as the rising stars of "peoplehood" in this new world.  Humans, halflings, they're all struggling to hold on in a hostile environment.  The Thri-kreen on the other hand are going to be the people <i>of</i> this world.  <br/><br/>I'm, not talking natives vs aliens, I mean the world is turning and it happens that the Thri-kreen are the guys who are best suited to what it's becoming.  Maybe in the dim and distant past they were the wierd freaks that lived in one tiny corner of the world, but now?  Now they're thriving.  We fucked up the wolrd and now it's these guys' chance.  They'll probably obsolesce the old races in time.  Make them perfect desert dwellers, with sod-all water requirements, not bothered by the sunlight or the heat, resistant to the radiation-analogue.<br/><br/>That feels like a good reason for them a reason to be in the setting to me.  Emphasising the problems people face by contrast with a pretty inhuman race that largely doesn't care.  And highlighting the fact that the world has been <i>changed</i>.  The friendly bombs have fallen and it is no place for <i>humans</i> now.  Hell, for extra-bonus contrast say that the Thri-kreen are physicaally unable to use defiler magic.  Not only are they the guys who will inherit the world, they're incapable of fucking it up again the way we did.<br/><br/>I imagine you'd want to keep them fairly uncommon to avoid a thri-kreen-centred world (which would be a pretty drastic change).  But make it obvious that they're the up-and-comers.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I think (unsurprisingly, this is always my answer to these threads), that Judd has it right in that all DS needs is to be played with a better system.

First thought that comes to mind: If the system is one with multiple "successes," there ought to be mechanic where you can steal successes from other players' rolls if you're doing magic.                        </div>

I like this idea.  It puts me in mind of a potential bit of <i>Old Wive's Tale</i> for the world: "Whenever a baby dies, a Thri-kreen is born."  (Or maybe it's not an Old Wive's Tale.)  A sort of double-edged bit of folk wisdom - intended as comfort to grieving parents, but also a reminder of the growing Thri-kreen population (especially in contrast to the shrinking populations of the other races).                        </div>

                            I like the Magic and Psionic split which John mentioned upthread.  Druids suck the life from themselves and animals.  Templars suck the life from the Dragon Kings.  The DKs suck the life from the populace.  Defiliers suck the life from everything.  Clerics dry up water and kill cacti. <br/>
<br/>
No race can breed with Humans.  Elves can breed with Halflings, Dwarves with Giants, Elves with Dwarves.<br/>
<br/>
Play up (not down) the City-States.  The world is the Middle East on a much larger scale.  Nomads (other than Halflings) raid the desert for water, food, plunder and wives.  Sultans rule the land and the Dragon/God Kings rule over all.  The desert should be filled with oases, monuments, slave labor, raided tombs and hungry ghosts.<br/>

Re: Half-Giants and personality<br/>
<br/>
All Half-Giants have MPD.  They don't have different alignments, but multiple personalities.  Each personality has it's own Class, Skills and Feats.                        </div>

<b>Half Giants, Redux</b><br/><br/>They are called the Tall Men- They are not huge and strong and dumb like the classic half-giant, but rather generally the same proportions, but a little taller and broader than people. Their skin usually tends to be sickly white or pale yellow.<br/><br/>Their "attitude changes" are explained by the fact that there are a limited number of Tall Men personalities, just over 10,000 or so. They are spirits that drift between Tall Men bodies. One Spirit could inhabit a body for a time, or permanently, then just as suddenly will itself to drift off in slumber and inhabit another body, or return to the Form. The Form is where all hostless spiritcs go, a metaphysical plane of existence. They can travel back into the world to inhabit spiritless Tall Men bodies, or to drift into newborn Tall Men.<br/><br/>There are never more than 10,456 Tall Men living in the world (usually less). If no one inhabits the Form, and all Tall Men are alive in hosts, no new Talll Men will be born: Pregnant Tall Men females will remain in a state of gestation until another Tall Man dies and returns to the Form.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            BTW, sorry if this is feeling "bloggy" by the fact that I'm posting continuously to it. Next to Planescape, Dark Sun was one of my old standby gameworlds for fun and excitement back in High School and College. I'm digging exploring alternate stuff with other folks.<br/><br/>Anyway, <br/><br/><b>More Magic</b><br/><br/>What if magic didn't suck the life out of plants? What if, instead, magic was extremely powerful and abundant for the most part... but the side effect of using all that magic to effect your will was a kind of "radiation" that caused plants to whither and die just like it did originally. Does that change anything really? I thought it might make for an interesting nuance (ala "pollution"), but since the effect is the same I'm not so sure now...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Looks like Andy read<i>Grendel</i>.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I haven't.  I've read surprisingly few literary classics save Greek tragedys/comedys, the Mahabaratha (sp?), and Shakespeare. No Dante, no Illiad/Odyssey, no Beowulf, no Genji Monogatari, etc.<br/><br/>Just curious, what's similar?                        </div>

                            I like the idea that magic is water, and water is magic.  Lends itself to the desertification theme, but it also makes relationships and tools that have to do with water very important.  It also imparts a natural geography to the world's magic, since aquifers, cisterns, and living things would be sources of magic.  The magic as radiation thing doesn't work as well for me, but the idea that magic is indelibly connected to the ecosystem...that's stone cool.  Gives a reason for Dragon Kings to maintain large city-state populations.  More blood for magic if you need it.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the idea that the Thri-Keen are the inheritors is interesting, maybe because they have a natural biological and metaphysical inclination to conserve water.  Thematically, the idea that humanity and humanoid species are on the road to extinction is nicely tragic, and adds that extra background fillip to the "survival" motif.  Could shape a lot of interactions with the Thri-Keen, too.  Are the bugs compassionate toward the "dying" races?  Haughty?  Impatient?  (As in, "Come on, die already...!")<br/>
<br/>
In this light, psionics (I'd call it something else, like witchcraft, maybe) remains powerful on a personal level, but meaningless on a larger, ecological scale.<br/>
<br/>
Now upscale the Brom stuff against these themes of a dying race and ecological deterioration based on desertification.  People face the dying out by engaging in drugs, debauchery, violence, consensual torture, and the like.  Masks, carnivals, fetishwear, scarification, tattoos to indicate city-state and gang allegiances.  Water runners would be important pieces of this society.  I'd think you'd have fewer children, or maybe more but with a higher infant mortality rate.  You might also add a lot of cults into flagellation, sadomasochism, etc., all appealing to the dead gods for mercy.  Black Death stuff with a spread of hysterical reactions to the death of the world.  You'd have floods of refugees huddling in tents under parching wind, along with displaced spirits and household gods fading as the water is burned away with the steady use of magic, lots and lots of gang warfare.  In the cities, the Dragon Kings move their pieces and cast their spells, maybe in a millennia-old chess game that is slowly burning out the world.  Now we're in the endgame, but the Dragons don't care.  Hence the epic need to go after the Dragon Kings.<br/>

Best,<br/>

                            Random musings:<br/>
<br/>
So the thri-kreen were originally just near-automaton workers in the fields of a vast empire of sentient plants. (Okay, they don't HAVE to be plantmen, but that's the vibe I'm on.) With the destruction of the ecosystem, this empire literally went extinct, leaving the thri-kreen to inherit the earth. Thri-kreen are perfectly suited for life in this new environment. To them, the world wasn't ruined, it was unintentionally <i>terraformed</i> in their favor, a gift from the whatever higher beings they honor. If a human ever saw a map of the extent of the thri-kreen reaches, he'd realize that humanity had already lost. It's <i>already</i> the thri-kreen's world, with the dregs of the other races sequestered to a (relatively) tiny pocket of the planet. But thri-kreen don't quite think in imperialist ways, so they don't really toot their own horns about the size of their empire, or make a coordinated campaign to wipe anyone out, they just maintain the inevitability of their inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
Psionics is solely a thing possessed by the thri-kreen, unless... other races CAN get psionics, but only through <i>surgery</i>. And it's not neat, tidy magic surgery. It's actual primitive brain surgery. There's just barely enough of an understanding of neuroanatomy to understand there's something <i>different between the brains of thri-kreen and humanoids</i>. Most of the time, the process results in failure -- psionic zombies with gruesome skull wounds. But chance of success is enough that the ambitious will risk their very minds... or the minds of others, as brutal experiments.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these things, this definitely is not a game <i>about</i> the thri-kreen. They're just sort of the quiet horror lurking underneath it all.                        </div>

                            Thinking about the idea of magic-as-radiation, what if it was but wasn't?<br><br>Magic makes stuff happen that wouldn't otherwise.  It's like directed human action, but <i>moreso</i>.  You chuck out all these spells, creating all these spectacular effects and they have to <i>go</i> somewhere.  They dissipate like smoke into the air, but they don't vanish into nothingness.  You could look at a spell as a temporary burst of order, then the after effects are an equal and opposite contribution of disorder to the world.  If you mix all the colours of the rainbow, you end up with brown.  The use of magic increases the tendancy of the world towards entropy.  That's why the world is a bleak wasteland.<br><br>Bonus nifty: by implication, any order-creating action driven by free will (magic is just the uber example) will eventually slingshot back into an equal amount of entropy.  The cosmological principles of the dark sun universe are <i>actively hostile to life</i>.  The system is rigged to make itself hostile to life in response to life's existence.  That's one hell of a metaphysical truth to have lurking in the background - and worth highlighting because it's so relevan to the foreground.<br><br>Anyway.  I swear I was thinking about radiation.<br/><br/>Take as a given that the world is a bleak wasteland because of entropy - the tendancy of chaos to average out over time.  As the amount of order (order is probably a bad term to use because it implies stasis, when from the human PoV stasis is the <i>consequence</i> of entropy) in the world decreases, entropy acts more and more on those remaining pockets of order.  Which is where the radiation thing comes in.  The world arrived at its' current through the averaged effects of cnstant change.  As there's less stuff <i>to</i> affect, the effects become more pronounced and noticable when they occur.  Hence mutations and weirdness and scary random things happening in the night and "my baby why won't you show me my baby?" are a part of the setting.<br/><br/>Moving on, you can also look at that in another way too.  Magic is fuelled by increasing entropy (not a straightforward cause and effect, but definite correlation).  From a certain point of view, any instance of order - living things in particular - <i>is a magic battery</i>.  And, people being people, exactly how long do you reckon it took someone who worked out the nature of magic to say "hmm, I wonder if there's a way I can decrease the lifespan of the world to fuel my real ultimate powerz?"?  I'm guessing about twenty seconds. <br/><br/> And that was the genesis of defiler magic.  In a world that's constantly slowing down, the regular kind of magic was growing less and less effective (because there was less stuff to act against).  Until people worked out what magic was <i>really</i> doing and made that crucial paradigm shift to using it <i>properly</i>.  And by properly I mean actively shortening the life of the world by 30 seconds every time they want to know "who's the fairest of them all?".                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I really like the "Water is Magic" idea, I'm gonna take it and run with it. It's given me a great idea for a DitV type game. <br/>(Prototype Document is here: <a href="http://www.box.net/public/czj4kxy2z7" rel="nofollow">Dust</a>)<br/><br/>I'm envisioning the players as wandering water-police / witchhunters called Dowsers enforcing the will of a empire that doesnâ€™t really exist, traveling through the wastes from one broken town to the next, measuring water reserves, enforcing the law, and driving out supernatural threats. I picture magic something along the lines as a drug addiction; sometimes people find old artifacts in the ruins that give them strange powers or make dreams come true; but these items are fueled by water, and when these artifacts burn their fuel, the water is gone for good. I can see twisted, desiccated, undead wandering the dunes looking to quench their eternal thirst, shadowy wraiths haunting old ruins, and the alien, unknowable Thri-kreen living on the fringes of everything, except that in reality it's the humans that are on the fringes. <br/><br/>Sorta like Dark Sun meets Dogs in the Vinyard, with a dash of Dark Tower on the side.                        </div>

                            OK, I too think the Water = Magic thing is an interesting idea. But why is water magic, and vice versa? Maybe more importantly, why do the people of the world believe that it's so? Are there varying beliefs? Does this explain the varying attitudes toward magic use?<br/>
<br/>
Once you define these things a bit, then you have the crux of the conflict of the setting.<br/>

                            I think such clarifications would be useful in understanding the setting from the outside looking in, but from inside the setting, there's no distinction between water and magic. Maybe the same word is used for both, or maybe magic is considered another <i>state</i> of water, like mist or ice. (Not that anyone in Dark Sun would have any idea what ice is.) Perhaps magic is to water what steel is to ore, a high refinement of a raw natural phenomenon.<br><br>So my guess why is water is revered? I'd guess it's the same reason sun cults revered the sun, because it is viewed as the source of human life. Pools of water have a mystical quality to them even today, just look at the reflecting pool in Washington as an example. Maybe water's existence is a sign that once, a long time ago, there was a place for humans in this harsh world and that the pendulum may swing again.                        </br></br></div>

                            I was being a bit vague (often a problem I have these days, it seems).<br/>
<br/>
I'm not asking why people believe water = magic, but what myths they believe in regarding why water is magic. How did that state come to be? Did some god make it so? Is it just a scientific fact, and manipulable through methods discerned via the scientific method? Is it a mystical thing that one can only understand through the eschewing water for long periods? Or by inundating oneself? Why is that?<br/>
<br/>
What are the various cultural beliefs that people have about why the world is such that water is magic? In that these may well vary between cultures (such as they are in DS), this is a source of conflict.<br/>

                            Bingo.<br/>
<br/>
So, to use water, is to use her blood. The laws that govern how it works are governed by this fact. As she's dead, that means that she doesn't actively monitor the use of her blood - how could she if she'd dead? So it's there for any to use. But it works according to how she planned it to work when she killed herself to create all life.<br/>
<br/>
Sound right?<br/>
<br/>
Except that the whisperers believe that she was killed unexpectedly and without plan. So it's just raw power laying about, to them, right? Except that when She returns, all will be judged by how they used her blood in her absence. No?<br/>
<br/>
Just examples, but sound about right?<br/>

Yeah, that sounds like what I was going for.  This way magic still comes from somewhere, but is an impersonal source of power with some Lovecraftian Elder Being that could awaken and kill everything.  Everything is more awesome with Lovecraft ... except Lovecraft.                        </div>

                            I just got out of a five hour meeting, so anything I write at this point is gonna be mush. Iâ€™ll add more a little later. A few quick points though:<br><br>I like the water = blood of some god/goddess = source of magic. Very cool. I hadn't even thought about defining why water is magic, or at least how people rationalize it. The original people who discovered the magical properties of water never figured out WHY it's magic, they just figured out how to exploit it. The great folly of man was they started treating magic like science; they expected it to be controlled and rational and it wasn't. It was primal and addictive and they ruined the world. <br><br>After eons of living in a water poor desert-world, religions and myths are going to spring up, though. Probably multiple religions, probably at odds with each other. I figure the Dowsers are going to have a religious bent too. I think the goddess / blood thing sounds perfect for them. Add some crazy lovecraftian fringe cult out in the desert too, mix in a few dessicated ghouls feeding on body fluids...<br><br>I just want to really steer clear of the DnD vanilla fantasy mentality toward religion, where people donâ€™t â€˜believeâ€™ in their gods, the gods actually walk around and do stuff in the flesh. Religion just gets stale if you take the faith out of it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            One of the cool things about the Dark Sun setting was that there were no gods, in the usual D&amp;D sense. The clerics took their powers from the elements, and templars channeled their powers from their sorcerer-king.                        </div>

                            That term "cleric" (which I'd be the first person to say has strange connotations) does imply religion. Rather, if somebody gets their magic from the elements, then where's the spiritual belief that backs this? Why are the elements sacred? What mythology backs these beliefs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good comments Jacob. But are we saying that most everyone in the setting is an atheist? Believing that there are no gods, not even very quiet ones that don't deliver magic?<br/>
<br/>
Try to look at where the characters come from in terms of their cultures. Let's take the halflings, for example, as a culture - one that (if I understand it correctly) condones cannibalism of other sentients. Why do they think that this is a right thing to do? What to the old teach the young that transmits their culture?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I understand that the DS setting is to some extent an allegory for environmentalism concerns. And you can focus on that in a simple "Save the World vs Wasters" dichotomy, in which both sides are simply rational, and one side is just not altruistic enough to realize that they're destroying the world for future generations.<br/>
<br/>
But I think that's going to get old pretty quickly, in part because it's too simple an equation. Probably fine if what you're looking for is just a place to stage miniatures battles. But if you're looking to get at some more serious introspection about the relationship of cultures and beliefs and their intersection to environmental matters, I think that you'll have to add some things to the setting.<br/>
<br/>
That is, D&amp;D settings are often quite thin in these departments because all they need to function in terms of setting up conflict is the alignment rules. They are evil, we are good, let's fight! But that voids all real discussion in game about the potential subject matter. To make it have any depth again, you're going to have to chuck alignments, and start digging deeper into the belief systems that the cultures have in order to find the more complex conflicts that lie beneath.<br/>
<br/>
That "digging" may mean, in fact, "making up stuff." There's a point at which you'll look at the culture at hand and it should occur to you that it's far, far from detailed enough to be like any real culture. At that point, it's fine to start adding details not only to make it realistic, but to create sources of conflict.<br/>
<br/>
For example, to me the most interesting thing isn't to try to make the conflict between the major sides at all more grey. But it's to factionize each of the big sides themselves so that there's a lot of potential for conflict.<br/>
<br/>
An easy one, for instance, is the "Ends Justify the Means" argument. That is, there'll be some rebelious types who feel that it's OK to damage the environment a bit in the course of overthrowing the regime. Then there'll be those rebels who feel that doing so is throwing away the potential legacy that they're fighting for. And what of other rebellions in other city-states? Is it worth overthrowing one Dragon-King if that merely means that another will take it's place? What values to the rebels in that place have? Are they compatible?<br/>
<br/>
The mere existence of "Preservers" as opposed to "Defilers" says that such philosophical differences appear on an individual level. But somebody taught this magic to each of these types, they didn't learn it from nowhere. Who does this teaching, and can they possibly avoid being involved in the politics that swirl around them?<br/>
<br/>
Are all of the Druid spirits all friendly with each other? Or are there separate groups of Druids based on how their spirits interact? How do they relate to the spirits? That is, who teaches a Druid how to speak to a spirit? And what lessons do they tell in their stories about the spirits in terms of what to say in order to placate said spirit? What values does that transmit to the individual?<br/>
<br/>
Even if the world has a large amount of materialist thinking, I think we can see that there's a potential of complex inter-relation of belief systems that you can develop here. You don't have to make them whole cloth, there are the seeds of these things right in the setting material. All you have to do is to develop them into something deeper than just a source of power, but discover the groups' and characters' relationships to those powers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course using a system that brings this sort of stuff out in natural course of playing would be a great assistance to developing all of this. I've already seen some preliminary HeroQuest conversions for Dark Sun, and these awesemofie the setting very, very well.<br/>

Yeah Mike, at some point the Setting has to stop and the System has to begin.  Of all the Awesome-o-fied threads, this is by far the awesomest IMHO.  The ideas thrown out for this have been off the scale cool.  But there is only so much you can get out of Setting.  The real exploration comes with the System is mated to it.  I'm kinda getting off topic for this thread, so I'll shutup now.  Maybe I'll do a series of articles on Setting on my blog.  This thread has shown me a lot.<br>

                            As for religion, here's what I've been mulling over my my home brewed re-envisioning of Dark Sun.<br><br>Dowsers: Combination Witch Hunter / Water Police, they serve as preservers of a sort. They travel from one small outlying community to another, measuring water reserves and rooting out Deviants (magic users) and combating supernatural threats. They're not restoring anything, really, just making sure water isn't being wasted through magic anymore. I like the idea being tossed around that they believe water is the blood of God, and therefore sacred. Kind of like God's Watchdogs on DitV, but harsher and more desperate.<br><br>Deviants: People who fall into the temptation to use water magic. Every once in a while someone finds a Siphon in the ruins, an artifact that grants the user magical power, but burns water for fuel. Often the temptation for power (or maybe just food) is too great and the person (or community) who finds the Siphon starts using it. Deviants are defiliers, but some are sympathetic, just trying to get by.<br><br>Blood Cults: Somewhere along the line somebody figured out the human body is 90% water. Dark blood cults sprang up in the deep desert where potable water was scarce, and people started rigging Siphons to use blood instead of water. Over time the magics invoked through blood Siphons became twisted and vile. The blood cults are defilers too, and crazy sadistic evil ones.<br><br>As for the original setting's druids and clerics, I'm kinda rolling them into tribal shamans and desert holy men. Shamans are mostly preservers, trying to bring life back to the desert. Maybe some of them have minor spiritual powers without the need of a Siphon, and if they do, it would be under debate if their strange spirit magic burned water too. I figure that most Dowsers would treat them like Deviants, better to be safe than sorry. <br><br>As for the Thri-Kreen, I plan on making them so alien that nobody KNOWS what they believe, if anything.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I want to echo Mike H's comments about answering "Why?" to explain the water/magic link.  I'll add that I think you can have mysticism and even myth without necessarily requiring everything to be explained via a cult worship frame.  If water is magic, maybe something like a three-element alchemic-cosmologic model: water is the ever-shifting, animating border between the immutable Earth and infinite Sky, both essentially fixed state elements.  Hence its metaphysical connection to life.  Maybe Water is itself alive on a spiritual level, and so is logically the progenitor of Life.  Magic is a means of burning "Spirit" and so also consumes water and dessicates the life-giving capacity of the world.<br>
<br>
Under this model, you can still have water said to be the blood of the Creatrix--but maybe it has its own agenda or host of spirit-awarenesses attached to it.  Magicians commune with and command the spirit(s) of water--maybe water even bargains with such individuals in order to survive.  You can still have cults, of course, but you could also have your solitary adepts that use magic without any religious or even mythic trappings.<br>
<br>
Once we have the major elements in place - survival/extinction, water/magic, Thri-Keen inheritors - it'd be interesting to find other smaller details that serve as logical extensions of those setting pillars.  Water conservation taken to a Dune-like level, for instance, as reflected in exsanguinatory funeral rites.  Cisterns marked with the sigil of the ancient Goddess and threatening curses for water-thieves.  Hospitality being predicated on offering guests a small cup of water and thereby creating a "water-bond."  The sacred flesh of (increasingly rare) fish.  Prevalance of fish- and frog-masks at festivals celebrating life.  Sand and oil scrubs as baths for the masses.  Walled gardens that contain the last specimens of water-dependent species.  Heavily guarded granaries.  Harsh penalties for water-thieves.  Hard-tack bread leavened with blood.  Mysterious pacts with the local Thri-Keen hive (maybe volunteers for "wet-nursing" Thri-Keen grubs with living bone marrow).<br>

If you have something interesting in mind, be it a core mechanic or a hack for any system, spill it!<br><br><b>Idea 1: Water</b><br>I just had this image in my mind of a pitcher of water in the middle of the table and everyone having their own small cups. Whenever they want to absorb some magical energy, they have to pour some water from the pitcher into the cup. Whenever they want to use magic, they have to take a sip from their cup.<br><br><b>Idea 2: Literal Dice Pool</b><br>Less literally, I also had this thought of a big punchbowl filled with blue dice that represents a "pool." (Get it? Pool of water. Pool of dice. Anyhoo...)<br><br>Blue dice can be grabbed from the bowl to do anything, but they change color once they're used. The color represents the act for which the die was used and also indicates that the die cannot be used for any other purpose.<br><br>For example, if a die were used to heal or injure someone, it would be replaced with a red die. From that time forward, that red die can only be used to heal or injure people.<br/><br/>Over time, the blue pool becomes stained and cloudy. It becomes a record of how the entire group behaved for that session.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I like the bit about water, but that's a lot of dice.  .. ... ... and yet, I've bought Koplow dice in the hundreds, so I'm not one to talk. :-)<br/><br/>If you want to play the survival parts of the setting up, here's a possible way:<br/><br/>Throw a group of bonus blue dice in the middle of the table. This is Water.  When you use them, it symbolizes dehydration.  Imagine them as Bonus Dice from TSOY (but if I were using TSOY, I would completely remove Gift Dice and replace them with Water Dice), or those bonus 1d6es in Eberron (but for d20 I'd replace them with 1d10s). So an average group will have about 20 or so of these dice. <br/><br/>These dice only replenish once per scenario/adventure completion. Not every session, but rather at the completion of an "Adventure", at which time the game world advances no less than One Week, and the Water dice are replenished.<br/><br/>A player can pull and roll as many Water Dice for a roll that he wants to. No limit. Though a social example of, "it's probably more polite to only take one or two max unless the others envourage you to take more" would be helpful.<br/><br/>When a player really wants something, they take a Water die, roll it and add it to the result. They can do this for an action, a conflict, an attack, a damage roll, etc. If they want to, they can pull dice Before their initial roll, or after their roll. They cna then add an Adiational water die to the roll, and so on.<br/><br/>When a player uses the last of the Water Dice, <b>SOMEONE DIES</b>. A character, that is. Player death is not encouraged.<br/><br/>The Discussion: The group members look around. Someone may volunteer: "I want to die, guys". In that case, the GM kills off that character (see below). In most cases, no one will step forward to die, or will find it more fun to go with the Call to Death.<br/><br/>The Call to Death: The players should engage in as little open debate as possible. There's no reason to convince the group of Who Should Die, in fatc it would be best to explicity not allow such talk. Instead, pieces of paper are passed around. The players have to write down the name of the PC who Should Die. They then fold it up and pass it to the GM. If someone accidentally posts the name of a Player instead of that player's character, then that vote paper is ripped up- The GM is encouraged to give that chosen player a disdainful look as he does so. <br/><br/>The GM silently counts the votes, finds the "Winner", nods in affirmation, and destroys the votes (preferably by fire). If there is a tie, the GM may call for another vote (requesting that the players think about changing their vote, but that they don't have to). Otherwise, the GM can just choose between the two chosen characters. If after the second vote there is a second tie, the GM should just choose one of the two characters.<br/><br/>The name of the Chosen Characer is not revealed.<br/><br/>The Death: Within the next session (any time during that session), the GM will create an opportunity for that character to Die. There is no saving throw or dodge roll. It fucking Happens. The Death has to follow the guidelines set below that fit the mileu of the Dark Sun World. The GM is encouraged to create a scene of chaos, and lead the players to think that perhaps Another character had been the Chosen Character (if you've watched enough House MD, it's like the scene before the opener: You see someone obviously sick, but then person <b>next</b> to them ends of having convusions and being the Big Sick Patient that episode).<br/><br/>The death has to come about from one of the following things:<br/><br/>The Harshness of the Wilderness - (being caught in a sandstorm, falling into a sand trap, being preyed upon by Fire Murder Ants, etc)<br/>Random Violent Act - (bandit crossbow bolt, rampaging monster, noble's carriage rolls over you, etc)<br/>Fury of the Sorcerer King - (If you have done actions that would have angered the Sorcerer-King, then she finds out, and kills you, either herself, through her templars, or by some combination of torture and execution - Tossed into the obsidian mines where a guard shivs you after your first day, etc)<br/>Treachery - (poison elf tea given to you by an assassin who was long on your trail, stabbed in the back by an NPC you saved, etc)<br/><br/>After the Death, the Water Dice are automatically returned to normal.  One of the Water Dice is replaced with a die of the color Red*, and are called Blood Dice.<br/><br/>(and if it were my game, these Blood Dice would be higher stepped than regular water dice. Like, if all Water dice were d6es, then these dice would be d10s or d12s).<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Actually, thinking about it a bit, this might acutally fit more in a Tribe 8 game than a Dark Sun game, replacing "Water" with something else (Companionship?)...                        </div>

                            Gribbly insects are cool.  I don't see many horses being around, and camels have flavour implications that don't seem quite right to me.  So what about riding scarabs and big beetles of burden?  They'd also be the number one soruce of chitin for weaponry and armour.  There'd probably be breeds grown specificly for the high quality of their antlers or carapces - but that would be for the really high class stuff.  The bulk of the chitin in use comes from the dead husks of knackered old beetles of burden.<br/><br/>On the other hand, domesticated giant insects might weaken the Thri-Kreen conceptually.  I'm not sure it's such a good idea to have domesticated bugs <i>and</i> alien bugs in the setting together.  Maybe lizards instead?  They're very desertish, and lizardhide leather is a nice visual schitck.  <br/><br/>If you're comfortable delving into traditional D&amp;Dery, have people breeding varieties of Basilisk.  They're traditionally lazy/ornery (camel parralel), six legs are cooler than four, and they're identifiably fantasy.  Say that basilisk breeders burn out the eyes with hot pokers to make them safe.  That's a good mental image to me - big hard-as-nails six legged lizards with scarred eyesockets.  Their handlers screaming and thrashing at their flanks to get them moving.  Plus it ties into the greater theme - you have a traditional fantasy staple being broken.                        </div>

Now that the Dune-can has been opened, may I suggest sand worms? (It's a pun!) Kidding, of course.<br/><br/>I don't think giant domesticated bugs diminish the Thri-Kreen any more than cows diminish humans. The fact that all their "technology" is bred and grown from nature, in a sort of medieval bio-tech, actually enhances their alien-ness. It also re-inforces their relationship with the environment. While humanoids exploited the world's resources to make it habitable, the Thri-Kreen are fine to go a more nature-friendly route, gently nudging pre-existing natural tendencies (like a breeding a beetle with a very shiny exoskeleton into one that can also produce armor and food).                        </div>

                            Mul.<br/><br/>Dump dwarves entirely.  To add to the impression of a fantasy world slowly running down, say that the dwarves have interbred with humans to extinction.  They've been subsumed into the human race.  The Mul are when the recessive dwarf blood comes to the fore.  <br/><br/>They're sterile parodies of their dwarven ancestors, often suffering some degree of mental deficiency to boot.  A Mul's birth usually means the death of the mother and rejection by the father.  Mul are effectively orphans, sold into slavery for a pittance by grieving parents.  There's a great stigma against them .  Those Mul born with all their faculties intact have to struggle against predjudice their entire life, and many buckle under the strain.  Those that don't and successfully rise "above their station" have a reputation for being vicious, hateful bastards.<br/><br/>I'm really not a fan of lots of weird races in fantasy - I find that they dilute everything.  But elves and dwarves are fantasy staples.  I like the idea that the dwarves bred themselves out of existence, leaving the broken mul behind as their legacy.  Elves beg for a different but equally drastic fate.  It's a little overdone, but having them as xenophobic racial purists seems appropriate.  <br/><br/>They'd shun all contact with humans, indocrinating their children from birth.  Pointing to the dwarves as an example of what comes from associating with lesser races.  They only trade with the human cities out of necessity, and those that do are a caste of pariahs, scorned by their own people for the vital service they perform.  Even so, they're still elves and just as hateful as any other.  The pariahs cover themselves completely when visiting the human cities and wear brightly coloured chitin masks over their faces.  Bonus irony - chances are that the stuff they're trading is the salvage from raided caravans, or raids on another city.<br/><br/>I'm seeing the elves as nazi fremen.  Desert legends, you pray that you don't ever meet them and nobody's entirely sure how many or how widespread they are.  They would not be playable.  Ever.  Half elves are absent.  Not even any "should such an unlikely thing occur...." note (aka: play one of these and be awesome and unique).  it just doesn't happen.  Hasn't happened in living memory.  Hasn't happened for so long that no living being even believes that it's possible.<br/><br/>So, yeah.  I think there's some nice symmetry there between two traditionally opposed races .  The dwarves got too close to humans, and the elves hold themselves apart.  Both destructive extremes.  The dwarves come off slightly better, but then there's the messy matter of the Mul.  Nothing clean.  And again, traditional fantasy defiled.                        </div>

                            Re: Andy's Water Dice as bonus dice idea:<br/><br/>This is cool. I bet you could also use it as a straight up addition for Burning Wheel. You just have the pool of Water Dice sit in the middle, and at any time during open play any character player can grab a few of the dice to add to their roll as Advantage dice. That should work, yeah?<br/><br/>Now when you're in script play, i'd want you to have to spend an action to grab your bonus dice - y'know, to <i>take a drink</i>.                        </div>

                            Hi Jacob.  Hey, I'm not offering my cosmology ramble as a One True Explanation, only as one possible explanation of many.  Like Shreyas, I prefer a number of different takes.  Sorry if I sounded like I was offering a rigid cosmology.<br/>
<br/>
As a writer, I prefer to map out the limits of magical systems closely, while retaining a core element of mystery so that magic doesn't become essentially another form of technology.  Same for world-building as GM.  For the reader or for characters or players in that world, the mystery should absolutely remain central.<br/>
<br/>
On other stuff:  I love the six-legged blinded basilisks as staple beasts of burden.  Riding lizards and insects.  Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
The water dice idea is really cool.  I'd like to see some metaphysical impact on the setting as well.  I'm thinking if there's a relationship map or Verge-like world map, something gets degraded to reflect the draining of magic from the world. To me that's intrinsically more interesting than character death.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe whoever takes the Blood Die (Dice) gets a name token that converts into an extra slip for the later drawing...?                        </div>

                            I like that world focused alternative. In a more (mechanically) traditional game, you could give the water wasting characters an assortment of "suvivalist paranoia" type traits, qualifiers to their relationship traits, or some other sort of loss of Trusts, Connections, etc in place of singling out a character to be doomed. <br/><br/>Kind of a different tone - more of a slow degradation and complexification of the characters freedom of action, rather than the shock &amp; horror of suprise death. (It's probably more complicated than that, but i'm not so good at this sort of thing!)                        </div>

Thomas T, Your thoughts on races are seconded here.  I love it!  One thing about elves, okay they want to keep their race pure.  That's cool.  But why?  What more are they protecting?  What's their end goal?<br/>

                            ...good question.  They are rather shallow, aren't they.  Hmm.<br/><br/>Idea  - elves love the world.  Their current state is an exaggeration of the "woe is us elves who ponce around in pretty forests while the silly humans breed and fill the world" thing.  In a metaphorical blink of an elven eye, humans pushed the world off the edge of a(n equally metaphorical) cliff.  Traditional mild elven xenophobia is usually based around human ruining the world with their destructive ways.  In Dark Sun they really did; deliberately and slowly.  I can't imagine they'd be too happy about that.  That seems like a good basic motivator, plus traditional elven arrogance.<br/><br/>But what do they <i>want</i>?  At the risk of being too close a fremen parallel, what immediately springs to mind is that they want the world to be green again.  Their reclusiveness isn't entirely motivated by disgust - they're tending to secret oases of life, the entire community devoted to tending these pathetic little pockets of greenery.  They're taking the long-term view, hoping that if they're <i>strong</i> enough they can bring the world back through sheer effort.  That seems nice - that these spiteful fuckers are motivated by love and hope.<br/><br/>Problem - pockets of greenery aren't very dark sun, even if they're largely off-screen.  Dilutes the idea too much.  What if the plants they tend to aren't green and leafy, they're grey and rancid.  The elves' oases are caves of underground fungus.  The elves as a race refuses to give in to despair and even cultivating corpse-born muchrooms <i>is a start</i>.  Like I said, they're taking the long view and they only need to make sure that they're <i>strong enough</i> to make a difference.  To a certain extent they deliberately cultivate their own hatreds and predjudices to make themselves stronger, tempering their culture like steel.<br/><br/>Ooh - steel.  That would be a cool elven schtick in a world where most gear is made from stone or animal parts.  If the elven raiders were recognised by the shine of their weapons - kinda like a jolly rodger.  Elves are long-lived and few in number, so they still have plenty of gear handed down from the old days.  And if they spend most of their time in underground fungus caves, maybe they occaisionally find a little of the last iron left in the world.  Elven blades could even be the prestigious uberweapons of the world.<br/><br/>Anyway - fungus.  Elves have always dreamed.  Nowadays, they make heavy use of narcotics - harvested from the various fungi they live around.  In fact that's probably a lot of what they trade to the human cities - drugs too powerful for fragile human minds.  I imagine they like that idea, trading poison to the humans so that they can kill themselves.  Expand on that - even the elves' attitude to trade is hateful.  They trade exactly two things - poisonous drugs for the humans to kill themselves with, and the spoils of elven raids on human caravans and other human settlements.  They will not see anything truly elven be defiled by human touch.  And even so the elves who do the trading are reviled.  Some serious xenphobia going on at all levels there.                        </div>

                            Half giants.<br/><br/>Big and stupid is boring.  They're not slow, just careful.  How's this for a reasoning behind alignment changes:<br/><br/>You know how arguments over emotional subjects like politics or religion never change anybody's mind?  Half giants don't have that problem.  They <i>listen</i> and actually <i>consider</i> other people's ideas in a way difficult for other races to understand.  A half giant's attitudes and beliefs change drasticly over time as they encounter new ideas and decide to experience them.  They will change the way they live their life to try and understand how other people live and think, all in the pursuit of some higher truth.<br/><br/>They're like large, indulgent, Buddha-shaped sponges.  They ask questions and they listen.  And then they try to understand through experience, consciously changing their attitudes.  They have the unique faculty of being able to <i>decide</i> what they want to believe.  A given half giant might be a frothing emotional fanatic, but it's because he was affected by the idea of such a role and wanted to know it.  In a month's time he could be an ascetic librarian, and some time after that perhaps he wonders what truth there is to be found in destroying all the knowledge he'd been guarding.<br/><br/>Half giants just seemed dark-sun enough that they needed to be in, but I think that that's my personal limit on intelligent races there.  Which is just to say that I'm not trying to rejig <i>all</i> of the gajillion races, just the dark sun essentials.                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
How about this for half-giants.  They are hoarders.  They are the ones with the treasure everybody wants.  The metal, the bone tools and weapons, gems, maybe even water-tight containers.  The player-characters need something to fight against and to fight for in this setting.  I think the half-giants fit the bill of the perfect enemy and their treasure fits the bill for the perfect target.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            I kinda like Andy's direction for half-giant personalities, but I think Thomas' idea might work better if they are left as a 'player character race'.<br/><br/>So if we have half-giants, where do giants fit in? Should the half-giants be their own race, not a hybrid? Are they a pre-cursor to the great destruction, or a byproduct of it? <br/><br/>I almost want to get rid of the idea of half-giants, and make the giants the beings with splintered personalities, sitting in a cave somewhere on a big stash of bygone equipment. Have them be dark-sun's equivalent of dragons, since dark sun's dragons have filled a different niche.                        </div>

                            First, perhaps Troy was confused by my seeming reticence to discuss system. I've refrained from doing so, because I'd merely be parroting what I've already said in other awesome-o-fy threads. Namely that for all D&amp;D settings, just using Hero Quest conversions using the methods that we've come up with on threads in the HQ forum at The Forge, is a near optimal method of improving these settings. But, well, now I've done it again.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the idea of a bucket of dice used with BW as a source of bonus dice is a nifty one. It makes for an interesting dynamic - do I conserve those dice, knowing that some bad guy may well come along and use them against me, or do I use them up so they can't be used against me? And then what do we do when the water is dry? Some dangerous restoration? It's a pretty fascinating problem. Like a "tragedy of the commons" but where one side has a good motive to preserve the commons. Sounds like a losing proposition either way...which makes it all about moral choices.<br/>
<br/>
The problems I see with this is that I'd be tempted to have a different bucket for different locales, to simulate that the levels of water are going down. Could be a hassle to keep track of. And somebody else is going to have to do the lifepath creation and such. BW is cool once it's ready to go, but even with the advice from the Monster Burner, it's a goodly amount of work to set up.<br/>
<br/>
Stefan, I think the fun thing is to juxtapose the "shock &amp; horror" moments with the long-term complexification. That heightens both. If you hammer on one or the other, either would become stale. The moments of horror give the characters constant chances to re-evaluate their goals as they're shocked out of any complacency they may have.<br/>
<br/>
I would have the Thri-keen ride beetles, but then, what I think is superior here is to find out what the source-material says. There's a whole book on the Thri-keen, actually. Surely that should give some idea as to what they ride?<br/>
<br/>
Put another way, I have no problem with altering a setting. But, then why bother with using an established setting at all? Is this "Athas, planet of the Dark Sun"? Or is it, "Some place where there's little water, and otherwise has D&amp;D-ish stuff? To once again parrot myself from previous awesemofy threads, these settings are already awesome, or it wouldn't be worth monkeying with them at all. There has to be a core of awesome, or else we'd be talking about some other setting.<br/>
<br/>
OK, sure, why not alter the setting some here and there - we'd probably do it anyhow. But, where the authors have done some cool work, why not root it out and use it? Why make up cool stuff where it's already been made up for us?<br/>
<br/>
That, once again, is how I see all settings. Grab the cool stuff, encode then in a good system, and then modify in play once you get going. It's relatively quick and simple, and, I've found, very effective.<br/>

                            Heya,<br>
<br>
RE: Half-giants as the Dragons of DarkSun- I'm totally on board with this.  I look at the Thrikreen as humanities greatest threat outside of the environment.  I can see them as being the main atagonists the PCs face.  The elves and halflings can be sprinkled in for different encounters when the Thrikreen get boring.  But for the big challenges (I mean, other than the Dragon and the Ulstalaggator), thats where the giants come in.  They got the goods and the strength to make a challenge difficult and rewarding.<br>
<br>
RE: Mike's why do this?-  I think it's a fun design exercise and remeniscing about the past is always interesting.  In the end, it doesn't matter if this is Athas or not, for those participating it is a chance to build on DnD's good foundation and create something new and fun.<br>
<br>
Somthing else to consider-  I always thought it was interesting how the majority of the populace in Dark Sun was illiterate.  The templars (I think) knew how to read and write language and the merchants had their own special code for keeping track of debits and credits IIRC.  I like this because if Athas used to be a "vanilla fantasy world" it makes discovering that fact a little more difficult (who can read the runic carvings in the ancient ruins?) and an adventure in and of itself.<br>

The only problem was that this was the presupposition of the REVISED Dark Sun boxed set (and the trashy novels), which basically made the world from something Dark to something Pretty Retarded.<br><br>However, if you say that it was a vanilla fantasy world - meets - totally gonzo life-rich garden paradise (without a heavy-handed metaplot-laden origin story), then that might work without taking away the dark parts.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Does the history of the world before really matter much if everything's going to be taking place in the present?  <br><br>The more specific identity you give to the past, the less the setting's about the dry broken world of the present.  And unless the details of that distant past are expected to come up in play (which doesn't seem terribly likely for a dark sun style game*) it's not even going to be terribly useful; just gamer porn.

<p>The reason you would ask the question is that it colours the present; I agree with you that the past is less important than about anything I can think of.</p>
<p>But a world that has always been like this will be meaningfully different than a world that was made like this, I think, and in the Dark Sun game I would run (which would be about bringing water to the world), I would want to choose between them.</p>

                            Thinking a bit about a specific â€œdying desert world fantasy gameâ€ system. <br/><br/>So, we start with Andy's idea of the common pool of Water Dice, which everyone may draw from to boost their actions.<br/><br/>Now, I would want to make it so the player-characters aren't just some jumble of adventurers, instead they are a community. A ragged little desert town (&amp;/or tribe), a noble house, a caravaning merchant guild (or gypsie family), or some such.<br/><br/>In any case, the Water Pool belongs to this community -  it is the community's water supply. And, since water is power, both literally and figuratively, it also can be seen as your people's powerbase.<br/><br/>Also, it'd be nice to have the water dice that are used turn into other kinds of dice, i think. (The pollution idea Daniel Solis mentioned.) This changes the tone a bit: you aren't using up your water supply, your world, you're corrupting it. The transmutation colours should all be uni-directional, morally â€“ dice that harm, only harm, dice that heal, only heal â€“ to keep the pollution unambiguous. I'm leery of letting â€œgoody-goodyâ€ dice enter the pool at all, because that seems to mean you're restoring the world, restoring hope, and that contrasts the â€œyou're doomed for realâ€ feel of it all. But maybe a little hope is a good thing; I know I'm not real big on the doom and gloom.  <br/><br/>(It occurs to me that you'd need a ton of dice just for this game, cause it doesn't work if the colours aren't perfect â€“ shades are fine, but you can't use just any old dice!)<br/><br/>It probably isn't as nice a system as Dogs' Stat1+Stat2 pools, but say you have each Stat cover an area of endeavour (or an arena of conflict?), and then within each of these areas you place your prose-descriptive traits. I believe I've seen character sheets that seem to use this set up, but i don't know if it is any good in practice. Anyway, each of these areas is tied to a colour of â€œpollution dieâ€. Normal rolls are colourblind, but any bonus dice taken from the Water Pool have to match the colour of your action's arena, or be untainted water dice (which then become tainted to the colour in use). <br/><br/>It looks like this means that there would need to be a great variety of different coloured dice (&amp; thus arenas) for the pollution to have a meaningful constraint on your actions. Having only four arenas is not going to cut it! Pollution is looking much more difficult than consumption.<br/><br/>But it seems like there should be a better way to correlate the pollution to your action. Like, maybe the result, or, better yet, <i>the intent</i>, of your action is what determines the colour, not <i>how</i> you do what you do.<br/><br/><i>Blood dice</i>, however, should be special, beyond this â€“ they come from sacrifices, from people, from death. Whenever someone (important?) dies, a blood die goes in the pool. I imagine you would use these dice just as untainted water dice, except that you discard them once they've been used. A death is only good once. (But maybe this is too messy to have in addition to normal pollution!)<br/><br/>(Ooh â€“ that is a weird effect! You gain resources from killing off your PCs and their dependants...)  <br/><br/>But I'm not sure this is going anywhere...                        </div>

                            I've read all of the awesome so far (the highlights for me: thri-keen on the upswing; water dice + Daniel's water-pitcher), and now I'm going to ignore almost 100% of it and go off on my own.<br/><br/>My own spin-off point: <b>What if the world died but nobody noticed?</b><br/><br/>Athas is just one (very large) region of a world on the order of a Dyson Sphere or the sphere in <i>Mechanical Dreams</i> - or an infinite, flat plane, for all intents and purposes.  This world works a bit different from ours - there's no sun, for one thing.  Instead, there are spheres which track courses just outside the atmosphere of the world.  Some places have more of these spheres (and are therefore hotter, though not necessarily drier) than others.  Most of the sphere is a vast, green, agrarian wonderland - a typical fantasy world full of hobbits and pastoral fiefs.<br/><br/>What happened at Tyr is that some fool back in the day figured out a way to tap directly into the power of these spheres for magical purposes.  This was a Good Thing for a while - good harvests are good for everyone - but the first Sun started to die, and in the way such things happen, the road to hell was paved with the best of intentions.  A second sun was corraled, then a third.<br/><br/>By now, the magic wasn't just used for agriculture - the desire for war had come to Tyr, and the Armies of Tyr marched forth.  More war meant more magic - more magic meant more suns ... and it just spiraled out of control.  The land started to die, and the harvests weren't full anymore.  The Good Kings of Tyr became the Tyrants, and as more people flocked to the City-State, the only thing keeping the opposing armies at bay was the now hideous power of the Dark Sun.  The people of Athas became a people apart from everyone else - outcasts in their own homeland.<br/><br/>So now, with the Dark Sun blazing above and no one to sap its power, it blazes day and night - year in, year out.  There are still those who use the power of the Great Sun, but they pay a terrible cost, becoming blackened, twisted horrors who plot and scheme amongst themselves for rulership over the teeming masses of Tyr - the Burnt Princes.  The rest of Athas is a wasteland, true - but some life continues just under the surface of the world, in tiny oases and deep crevices where the water from the Blue World seeps and trickles through the hard arteries of Athas.<br/><br/>People still come to Athas, albeit infrequently or not of their own free will.  Athas is the dumping ground of the Blue World - the pariahs, the wicked, the shunned are put on its border and sent forth to die.  Most do - some make their way down into the cracks, and some eventually find their way to Tyr.                        </div>

You could have them on a mat with a number written on it, which represents the true total, with however many dice you have (it should still be quite a few) on top.  That'd also make the Tragedy of the Commons something that crept up on the players, psychologically.  Suddenly they can't just erase a number on the mat to get more dice anymore, and they are Well and Truly Fucked.                        </div>

Going for a sort of "dumping ground of the planes" feel, kind of like Ravenloft, only physical instead of political/spiritual?

That could be very cool, if you lose track like that, but i think i'd really want to use the literal bowl of dice. The visual and tactile feel of it is central, at least for me - i don't think these (<i>Bacchanal</i>-like) types of mechanics are nearly as appealing without actual objects. If i didn't want to deal with the dice, i'd feel i'd be best off with different sort of system. <br/><br/>Maybe these sort of (literally) touchy-feely games are only good for conventions!<br/><br/>(<i>edits beacuse my coding is all trial and error</i>)                        </div>

                            I'm pleased to hear people like the idea of a big bowl of dice that gets gradually, visually polluted. Thanks, everyone! I've also seen a few comments about the cost of dice being an issue. May I suggest a compromise?<br/><br/>You can find bags of glass beads in many colors at your local craft shops for something like 2 bucks for a bag that weighs almost a pound. You can easily buy a few bags of beads for under ten bucks and have enough to fill a bowl. In fact, that's how those beads are <i>meant</i> to be used. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (For potted plants, fish tanks, that kind of thing.) If anyone played Embargo with me at GenCon this year, you've seen the beads I'm talking about. They're super-handy for board games.<br/><br/>So the system would still call for you to replace blue beads with beads of another color, depending on the action/intent. You wouldn't need to break the bank to get enough dice to fill the bowl, but you still get the tactile feeling of diving your hand into the bowl trying to find that last untainted blue bead. Does that sound reasonable? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Oh, I totally agree.  But you want an alternative for such a system so that you don't have to command all of your players to buy 60+ blue dice.                        </div>

So how do these things usually proceed? Does everyone break off and do their own thing, having been inspired by the awesome-o thread? Or is there an official progression of the awesome-ification into a new game?                        </div>

They could be converted into dice in the player's hand, so to speak.  Take them out, count them, then roll X number of your own dice.<br/><br/>The only problem I see with the 'diving in' mechanic is the question of pulling the right number out, which is actually a sophisticated manual skill.                        </div>

<p>This is <em>exactly</em> what I mean by breaking the tactile link. Furthermore if your dice aren't color-matching, then that's even worse. Every time you add an operation that changes the sensory quality, you are at risk of creating sensory noise.</p>

                            Pulling out an exact number of beads is indeed a difficult thing to do with large numbers, but you could do a mechanic like this:<br/><br/>Close your eyes and grab a handful of beads. Open your eyes and look at the beads you pulled out. Let's say there are red, blue and green beads in your collection. The possible outcomes include:<br/><br/>All red, green, or blue beads.<br/>More red, green, or blue beads than any other color.<br/>A "tie" between two colors or all three colors.<br/><br/>That's about 6-10 outcomes. Are there mechanics that can be based on those?                        </div>

<p>The obvious solution to me is to use smaller numbers. Or there was some stone game where you pulled them out one at a time and looked at the pattern, or...</p>
<p>At any rate, it is hardly difficult to pull three stones out of a bag.</p>
<p>Besides which, since when did we start designing to avoid sophisticated skills? That's stupid. We require <em>reading</em> and <em>writing</em> and often very high-level tactical analysis, and hesitate at pulling rocks out of a bag? I'm not buying that garbage.</p>

My concern was more about accessibility than anything else.  Plus, if you're looking for an exact number of beads, it's not 'dive and get', but more 'dive and root around', which if you're using glass beads can be a noisy affair.<br/><br/>I love the idea of the mechanic - I just think that we need to find the right mechanic that minimizes rooting around in the bowl.                        </div>

<p>One using Daniel's color combination suggestion (I think, btw, you want to use clear/blue/black/red beads, rather than both green and blue, for sharpness of contrast):</p>
<p>You want to do X. X calls for one color: black, white, or red.</p>
<p>You pull out some beads, and if the appropriate color predominates, you get what you want. If it doesn't, but the color PLUS BLUE predominates, then you can turn those blue beads into the appropriate color to get what you want.</p>
<p>You can use the runners-up to generate various effects, like fallout.</p>

                            Oooh... I like how powerful those blue beads are. So once blue beads are counted for a different color, say red, are the blue beads in your hand then removed from the bowl and replaced with an equal number of actual red beads?                        </div>

                            So let's say this is something like Dogs in the Vineyard and each session has a larger overarcing goal, like saving a town, and this big bowl of blue beads represents the unresolved situation. As the group does their thing, the blue is replaced with other colors until there is no blue left. At that point, the session is over.<br/><br/>Would it be apropos for the group to collect those beads in some sort of experience mechanic or is that tying too closely to the D&amp;D roots?<br/><br/>It may be useful to define the number of colors the system uses and the actions (verbs), methods (adverbs), motivations (adverbs), and/or stats (adjectives) that those colors represent.                        </div>

                            Just to post some novels that could serve as inspiration in an awesome-ified Athas: <br/>
<br/>
The Night Land by William Hope Hodgson - on a desolate future Earth mankind is besieged by strange silent hulking monsters that lurk in the vast barren land that surrounds their last city/fortress. A young man begins to communicate through telepathy with a young woman in another city (what? surely there aren't any more cities?!) and it follows his journey to find her. <br/>
The Magician's Nephew by C.S. Lewis - the city/world of Charn is empty and desolate, the result of an apocalyptic spell by its insane witch-queen. I've got this image of the game characters wandering through a ruined city of pillars (much more advanced than their present day), a wind whipping up from nowhere, voices calling for mercy, to find themselves in the presence of someone who might just be crazy enough to burn the world to escape from it.                        </div>

There's one bit where the human archaeologist does a dig, and finds mud huts over pre-stressed concrete over wooden buildings over steel; there's no virgin soil anywhere on the planet, the whole place is basically one big midden heap.  <br/><br/>It would be neat to have, way in the background, the idea that the Dark Sun world has gone through multiple cycles; someone topples the evil wizard dudes and restores the green world, and after 1,500 years somebody rediscovers geonecromancy and causes the end of the world all over again and rules as the new evil wizard dude in the dessicating ruins of the latest dead civilization, which was built on top of the ruins of a previous golden age.  <br/><br/>You could throw in some items of great power, a la Charnel Gods, that survive from one age to the next, but maybe only some of them get dug up in any particular turn of the wheel, so one civilization is marked by the Holder of the Whip, while another is dominated by the Way of the Dagger.  <br/> </div>

I think adding a cycle-of-ages concept would have an extremely significant effect on the mood of the setting.  There's "all this has happened before and shall surely happen again" fatalism, and there's "the good and kind things have passed forever and we are living in the last era of metahumanity" fatalism.<br/><br/>Not that I'm accusing you of killing my nihilmersion: I personally like the idea.  In general, I think that in sword-and-sorcery settings whose distant history matters at all, knowledge of it should always be incomplete, inaccurate, contradictory, etc. Letting your descriptions be guided by a principle like "there have been many pasts" might help that feeling.                        </div>

<br/>Thanks for bringing this back.  A lot of interesting topics in here although most of them are aimed at creating a whole new game, one that centers more closely on the environmental issues.    My take will be more of a challenge based game and one that meshes with the ideas behind the original game.  If things develop as I hope I might even have to look into a miniatures battle game for battles between armies.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>

<blockquote><br/>Not that I'm accusing you of killing my <b>nihilmersion</b>: I personally like the idea.  In general, I think that in sword-and-sorcery settings whose distant history matters at all, knowledge of it should always be incomplete, inaccurate, contradictory, etc. Letting your descriptions be guided by a principle like "there have been many pasts" might help that feeling.</blockquote>
Best game-related slang ever.  Consider me a nihilmersionist.  <br/><br/>BTW, we should awesome-of-fy something else one of these days. It's fun!<br/><br/> </div>

<br/>Yeah those are the interesting bits and I like how a lot of them work together.  <br/>I dont know if it was explicit anywhere or if we just read it into the setting but things like the Sorcerer kings, gladiator pits, and their building projects all being part of a magic ritual that drains life from the people to power the kings magic and eventually their transformation.<br/> <br/>I've never been sure of the elemental priests,  that might mostly be a reaction to them shoe-horning the idea in to the AD&amp;D system.  Why does an elemental priest of fire get cure light wounds while a preserver can cast a fireball?    I think adding elemental priests just clutters the setting when you already have preservers, defilers, templars and psionics bouncing around but maybe if they were made more distinct it could work.  I do like the idea of lunatics prophets shouting on the street corners but I dont know that they need any magic abilities to do that and they're probably not a pc.<br/> </div>
