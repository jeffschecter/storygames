I found this fascinating, because I just asserted in my Gamestorm presentation that actually "Second Wave" games were what got most indie games people into gaming (which is part of what I theorized explains our obsession with "story" and "premise" and marrying that with supportive mechanics), with the OSR being a "rediscovery" of a kind of play that's mostly unfamiliar.<br/><br/>So let's back up one or both of these claims with circumstantial, unprofessionally gathered evidence! Maybe it's entirely based on how old people were when they started, but I'm hoping we can find some interesting correlations.<br/><br/>List the games you were playing when you first "got into gaming" and describe a bit about how the groups you played with approached them.  I'll go first:<br/><br/><b>First Games I Consider Significant</b><br/>- Robotech<br/>- a little bit of GURPS<br/>- Rifts<br/>- In Nomine<br/>- Vampire 2nd + Revised<br/><br/><b>How We Played Them</b><br/>The rules in most of these games didn't make a lot of sense to us, either because they didn't match the fiction we imagined from reading these games or because the mechanics just seemed to fall down in the face of actual play, at least in the ways we approached it.  I remember not understanding basic stuff, like how many attacks per round you actually got in Palladium games (I'm still unclear about that), how many missiles you could fire at once in Robotech (all of them?), and how to deal with disturbances to "the Symphony" in In Nomine. Consequently, what we really engaged was characters and setting and being badass (in terms of gear and special powers and the like), engaging the mechanics when it made sense to do so, but even then it was mostly half-heartedly and we didn't like it when the mechanics gave us results that didn't make for interesting fiction. I played Vampire with a bunch of adult semi-professional actors from a local troupe and it blew my mind, but it was more about how they structured play and less about how the mechanics really drove the experience. That was the first time I really saw effective "sandbox" play in practice, though I didn't really figure out how to make it work myself until Apocalypse World.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371704/#Comment_371704" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T09:59:23+00:00" title="April  7, 2012  9:59AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first RPGs I played were the psuedo-board games/introductions to D&amp;D put out by TSR in the early 90s: <i>Dragon Strike</i> and <i>Dragon Quest</i>.<br/><br/>I was 12 at the time, and I played them with my two younger sisters. Mostly we moved our pieces around the board, read out of the adventure booklets and spoke in funny voices. I guess we rolled the dice, but I'm pretty sure we didn't use the full combat mechanics outlined in the rules. I think it was mostly a game of make believe with cool (cheap plastic) miniatures and awesome (for a 12 year old boy) pictures of strange creatures in the instruction booklets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371706/#Comment_371706" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T10:16:36+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 10:16AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First game I was exposed to was RIFTS, which I have never actually played - I just made characters and read the rule books and talked about the game with friends. I did, however, invent a RIFTS knockoff for my siblings and cousins called "Battalia 13" which we played extensively for a few summers. Around the same time came D&amp;D, which I was vaguely aware of due to some older friends of the family, but became more seriously interested in after reading a storyline about it in the FoxTrot comic strip. This was at the height of AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, but I accumulated a random assortment of AD&amp;D and BECMI books, which I used to play a vague, ramshackle, mostly made-up version of the game based primarily on the AD&amp;D Monster Manual. Then I started buying the current edition 2nd Ed books, which further contributed to this mostly-house-ruled style of play. A few years later after not playing much I introduced the game to my high school friends, and we built on my piecemeal house rules a series of increasingly streamlined systems (these were basically rules-light -the main reason I hadn't played RPGs "properly" up until this point is because I found the rule books too confusing and nobody else wanted to read them). This was really the first time I played RPGs in earnest, with ongoing storylines and persistent characters - it was all very gonzo, with PC leprechauns and werewolves, instant death potions, etc. After a few years of not playing once I finished high school, a new addition to my group of friends expressed interest in playing, and I initially proposed continuing with our weird fake version of 2nd Ed, but he (understandably) wanted to play "properly." By this point 3.5 was out, so we brought in another friend to DM a lengthy, traditional campaign for us, over the course of which I finally actually <i>learned</i> an RPG system instead of just using the books as inspiration for my own inventions.<br/><br/>I'd say that, collectively, represents my introduction to role-playing games. From there, I played a tonne of D&amp;D 3.5 and d20 Modern, switched to D&amp;D 4E for a while, discovered and became obsessed with indie/story games, and switched to Pathfinder for my current ongoing group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371707/#Comment_371707" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T10:52:00+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 10:52AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mentzner basic and then AD&amp;D - And I rarely actually 'played' much - mostly I read rules, made parts of dungeons, and hoped to play.

What was supposed to be the core rule book had a shocking lack of information on how to play. I seem to recall one page of random encounters with Zentraedi mecha, buried within pages and pages of vehicle and character stats. Naturally, I pored over that thing for years... I even set up a scenario with some friends where we had to defend an Invid drop ship, but there was never any overarching story. Same with the Star Wars stuff. I read it a whole bunch, but then when a friend's parent would find the book, they'd stick it in the trash and never mention it again. I think this explains why my gaming is so stunted, to this day.<br/><br/>Anyway, <i>The Window</i> was a bit of a revelation, what with its highfalutin yammering about being progressive and true and all that. It was everything I wanted -- something to transparently lay over any setting I wanted.

This slowly turned into being a GM because I wanted to be a writer. For my first few years I'd stick pretty closely mechanically to what the books said. Something...that I have not actually deviated from much except, ironically, for the more sort of Trad games I was playing back then.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I find the most interesting looking back on my earliest gaming days was that my most successful games had a very distinct and specific premise beyond just having a setting, and characters were made in response to that premise. It looked a lot like a Burning Wheel game in procedure. And then I had a few bad run-ins with the idea I needed to invent complete, scripted, adventures and those kind of messed with my GMing style.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also had some serious GM ADD that I'm still trying to deal with, although it's settled down more to 'What AW or Burning game do I want to run a campaign of now?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371713/#Comment_371713" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T11:14:51+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 11:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My earliest games, what comes to mind from the early '90s:<br>The LotR Adventure Game<br>2300 AD<br>Twilight 2000<br>Elhendi (a Finnish second wave fantasy game)<br>Call of Cthulhu<br>Cyberpunk 2020<br>Paranoia<br/>MERP<br/>Runequest<br/><br/>In general we played a variety of games in the form of quickly-aborted campaigns, mostly what might be called "traditional" or "second wave" as Jonathan does. The attitude and approach was mostly about replicating the feel and artistic qualities of the books and movies we enjoyed as young teenagers. Specifically, the type of strategic challenge-play that characterizes old school D&amp;D to my mind was absent; we did not treat roleplaying games as an extension of e.g. wargaming or boardgaming, despite having experience of <i>Hero Quest</i> and similar "rpg lite" boardgames that were all the rage back then. If I had to pin a creative agenda on what we were doing, I'd say that for most of us most of the time it was either genre simulation or frustrated narrativism or chaotic simulation of consequences play, all executed with a ten-foot pole due to the local standard way of setting up a campaign: we made characters first in isolation, then put them together in the setting and the GM tried to direct them into engaging with his planned content, all with little meta-level planning or coordination.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371714/#Comment_371714" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T11:20:08+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 11:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My introduction to RPGs was either the D&amp;D Red Box, or Palladium's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles And Other Strangeness; I genuinely can't remember which, because I was about 11, and I came across them pretty much within a week of each other.  TMNT never actually got played beyond a session or two (though we rolled up SO MANY characters), D&amp;D was the one that actually got played, and led to us picking up the rest of the boxes and eventually moving on to AD&amp;D2nd.<br/><br/>My group were friends from school (as in, we knew each other before RPGs, and RPGs were just another thing we did together), and we learned these games absolutely cold, from the books only, none of us knew anyone else who had role-played previously.  The Red Box basically tells you to go down into a hole in the ground, kill everything there, and take back the loot, and that was exactly how we played from basically 6th grade until we graduated high school.  The other BECMI boxes introduced mass warfare and interplanary stuff, but none of the other players were really interested in anything beyond getting their guys more loot and meeting interesting things to shiv, then starting over when their guy died or they felt like trying another class.  We eventually started playing other games too (Shadowrun and Star Wars were especially popular, and we liked the look of Rifts and made a bunch of characters, but we tried playing once and universally decided it was too tedious after resolving one character's six attacks during the first fifteen-second round of the first combat), but we basically played them exactly like we played D&amp;D.  Nobody cared about NPCs, or long-term plotlines, or anything beyond tabletop Diablo against slightly different backdrops.<br/><br/>I got bored of this a lot faster than the rest of the group, probably because I was often cajoled into DMing, so I was basically there to enable their leveling and skirmishing.  By high school I was starting to get into White Wolf, but absolutely could not convince anyone in my group to give it a shot.  By that point role-playing was something I did with those dudes that was mildly fun, as opposed to something I really loved.  It wasn't until college, when I met a more experimental group, that I got to play any campaign that wasn't primarily focused on getting/fencing loot and stabbing/shooting/spelling dudes.  So while D&amp;D was my first game and formative play style, I can't say it's an active influence on the way I prefer to play now, except in the negative (as in, I now actively avoid the things we did then, because I no longer have any interest in them).<br/><br/>I should note, I'm still close to a couple guys from my old group of D&amp;D-loving pals, and I love to hang out with them, and some of the other friends I've made though them.  But they still love to play D&amp;D the same way they did when they were in high school (using Pathfinder now, to a man they rejected 4e to the point where they refused to even READ IT, which kind of freaked me out), and only play other RPGs as far as they support that same "blowin' off steam by blowin' up dudes" core mission (Dark Heresy and Black Crusade popular alternate campaigns for when a couple D&amp;D/Pfinder guys can't make it).  Their active, ongoing interest in and play of D&amp;D for the better part of 30 years (and hearing their war stories) has basically prevented me from thinking of D&amp;D as "in the past" enough for me to re-examine it; if I wanted to play D&amp;D again, I have a standing invite to their weekly game, and when I have joined them it is EXACTLY as I recall it being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371720/#Comment_371720" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T11:37:41+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 11:37AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2012 11:40AM by Teataine.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The forum ate a longer post which might just be better because it will force me to say what I meant more coherently.<br/><br/>I started relatively late, in 2000, with the freshly printed D&amp;D 3E. Up to that point my idea of what roleplaying was was framed by that one paragraph in the ET novel, the D&amp;DeeDee episode of Dexter's Laboratory and Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale/Ultima. There was a lot of struggling with how to organize the play experience, with the lack of a "campaign structure" and ignorance about how things were supposed to run above the level of rules as such. Ephemera but no techniques. We had the books but no teachers.<br/><br/>There were two primary tensions with the system which shaped my gaming (and running, I was the DM 80% of the time). These tensions were orthogonal, perhaps opposite. <br/><br/>One was the sense that the imagined action did not fit the mechanical handling. You know the sort of thing where you imagine the hero ducking under the dragon's wind and sliding their sword beneath the dragon's scales? Yeah, no, it was all 5 ft. steps and rolling to hit, completely detached from the fiction. That pushed me to instinctively (without much thought, sometimes unconsciously) to discard or ignore rules that promoted that sort of play (pushing away from battlemats for example).<br/><br/>The second tension was between the "fantasy story" as inspired by reading Lord of the Rings and actual play (random, disjointed etc.). After a few early failed attempts at emulating Tolkien, I <i>initially</i> embraced the game over story and ran a successful, multi-year challenge-oriented sandbox campaign (note that I was very insulated from the hobby and other games and had no idea what that even was).<br/><br/>Stage two started when we discovered Vampire. The mechanical differences just blew my mind. No classes. Dice pools. Just whoa. Actual play was the opposite however. When we ran it it was just more D&amp;D - fighting and looting. When the older friend who introduced us ran it it was pure GM-driven plot partecipationism which left me passive as a player. The only time I felt fulfilled was when the participation demanded PvP (immediately neutered afterward). But all the talk about "storytelling" and "real roleplaying" as opposed to "combat" (silliest dichotomy ever) rekindled the flames of media-emulation, which inevitably lead to me dropping the successful sandbox improvisation for bog standard illusionism and continued in that vein for several years afterwards.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that those early years (roughly 2000-2005) were largely marked by the following traits:<br/>-the (expected) imagined action ("fiction") not matching the one produced in actual play by the system<br/>-engagement being primarily driven by characters being cool and the GM's world/story being interesting<br/>-looking to "we didn't even roll dice" as some ideal form (never attempted)<br/>-GM agenda overriding any systemic resolution                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371722/#Comment_371722" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T11:43:01+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 11:43AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>First Played (at age 13-14, 1989)</b><br/>Moldvay Basic D&amp;D<br/><br/><b>Other Games That Shaped My Early Play Experience</b> (from about ages 15-18)<br/>*AD&amp;D 2e (comprises the bulk of my play until my mid 20's)<br/>Talislanta 2e<br/>GURPS Basic Set (3rd edition)<br/>MERP 2e<br/>Chill (Mayfair edition)<br/>Marvel Superheroes Advanced (aka FASERIP)<br/>Top Secret S.I.<br/><br/><b>Games That Came Later, still Pre-Forge</b><br/>Shadowrun 1e<br/>Shatterzone<br/>Vampire: The Masquerade<br/>Werewolf: The Apocalypse<br/>Palladium Fantasy (1st and 2nd edition)<br/>D&amp;D 3e<br/><br/>As far as I can recall, the games listed in the first two categories make up the entirety of my table-top gaming experience until I was about 20 years old. The vast majority of my play was, first, with Moldvay Basic and then switched to AD&amp;D 2e. Until D&amp;D 3e came out, AD&amp;D 2e comprised the bulk of my gaming. I played 3e for a bit and then in 2002 I discovered the Forge. My head sort of exploded after that and the types of games I started playing changed significantly as well. Most of my play also switched to being online, via IRC.<br/><br/>As far as play goes, most of my gaming time was spent GMing, and I was sort of a stickler about playing by the rules. So, as best as I could, I tried to play by the book. Interestingly enough, that didn't stop any of the players from, you know, roleplaying. Eventually I started running AD&amp;D 2e in a very illusionist manner. I actually got to play a lot more 3e than I GM'd but I think by that point I was ready and primed for a sea change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371729/#Comment_371729" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T12:43:12+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 12:43PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2012 5:42PM by Peter_Aronson.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>First Game I considered Significant</b>\n<ul><li>LBB OD&amp;D (1974)</li></ul>\n<b>Other Games Played in that General Timeframe</b>\n<ul><li>Traveller</li><li>Empire of The Petal Throne</li><li>Villains &amp; Vigilianties</li></ul>\nI learned to by RPGs by playing with a bunch of hardcore wargamers  (which I was myself in those days).  The model we took for a D&amp;D session was the miniatures scenario.  This meant a mission-based approach combined with Referee (DM) neutrality and a readiness to make rulings to fill in the holes in the rules.  World-building on the GM's part was highly prized as it gave an interesting setting for the mission (a couple of the the GMs pulled out setting material from their trunk novels).  There was an emphasis on combat, which being wargamers, we were fine with, although not to the exclusion of other elements.  Miniatures were used from very early on.  The dungeons faded into the background pretty quickly to be replaced by political and "special forces" type missions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371769/#Comment_371769" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T21:28:10+00:00" title="April  7, 2012  9:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I think you're completely right about the origins of the indie movement.<br/><br/>My own earliest experiences were with GURPS 3rd and D&amp;D 2nd. My experiences were so essentially similar to a bunch of other people in this thread that I don't really need to go into detail.<br/><br/>I will add, however, that when I got to Brown University at age 18, year 2000, and joined Brown Fantasy Gaming Society*, a bunch of processes were set in motion that eventually lead me to indie games. FGS has a lot of really brilliant people in it but was/is really hindered by a lot of legacy bullshit from all those 90's trad games and also numerous Geek Social Fallacy-related issues. In particular people in the group wanted to run all these really intriguingly-premised games but often lacked the mechanical tools or correct social dynamic to put their ideas into consistently fun practice. (Ironically, this was/is far less true in terms of LARP**s, in which realm the group has evolved serious tools for truly player-driven games.) For instance, there was always an enormous amount of emphasis placed on keeping player and character knowledge congruent, and people were always hoarding secret information from each other in ways that were deeply deprotagonizing. <br/><br/>So when I found out in 2003-ish, through Ben Lehman (who was starting to read the Forge and stuff around then), about games that offered an apparent way out of these patterns, even though I was skeptical at first, I was very intrigued. Then he showed me Riddle of Steel and I was hooked for life.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*I'm still an active member at age 30, or as much as possible while living in New York City, and will be co-running a 30-ish person LARP at Brown next weekend!<br/><br/>**Non-boffer or "theater" LARPs, anyway. Boffer LARPs are a bit more problematical, for a variety of reasons that are off-topic here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371781/#Comment_371781" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-07T23:35:55+00:00" title="April  7, 2012 11:35PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well this is interesting!<br/><br/>First games in late 1979-81: Moldvay B/X D&amp;D Magenta and subsequent Blue Box, heavily influenced with bits and bobs from 1st ed. AD&amp;D.<br/>How we played: Mainly by the book, but with many house rulings as encouraged by the rules, plenty of roleplay and player skill adjudication, though as we developed our game, the stat check became omni-present as a narrative decision device. It fell into the same bank of randomising tools as the wandering monster check and town generation tables. Name level characters were always strived for, as they then became movers and players in our setting. This was a huge game at school / FLGS, with about 10-20 regular players, though my home game with my brothers was far more personal and immersive. Still very 'old skool', focusing on a sandbox using published modules as guides and starting points, filling in the world as we went, both through delving and questing, along with a fair bit of exploration simply 'to see what was there'. Heady times.<br/><br/>Next came Traveller, which was often played along side the D&amp;D game during the week. I GMed our own spinward marches game. The exploration minerva fro D&amp;D naturally transposed onto these games. <br/>How we played: It was almost verbatim every Episode of Blake's 7 as it came out. I remember taking notes from each episode as it aired on NPCs and worlds and relationships and then roleplaying the heck out of it with Traveller the next session! The rules seemed almost derived from this early 'inception' of what SF should be about. The implicit story hooks and thinly generated backgrounds during chargen gave us so much room to narratively explore. It was almost the antithesis of Star Wars and Star Trek. For us it was very 'British', both in feel and tone.<br/><br/>As the 80's boomed, we moved from D&amp;D to the HEAVY Rolemaster, and began a MERP campaign that went for some 7 years with the same group of 4 friends. We shared GMing and came up with our own 2nd Age ME game that absolutely rocked. We roleplayed the 'gaps' in the Silmarillion,  it was so awesome, almost like a pre-cursor to my later Burning Wheel epiphany. We knew the setting, we had some blocks of information gathered from the Silmarrillion and the Book of Lost Tales and our own adventures. We then decided as a group the next dramatic conflict to 'fill-in', bought an ICE module if available and roleplayed toward a conclusion. As we started uni, we gathered a like-mined bunch of Tolkien Nerdy types from the Middle English course and English Lit and roleplayed every Friday in the age old Manning Bar at Sydney Uni with a few Hobbits and Dark Ales aplenty. The ruleset was clunky and detailed, the games was bogged down with mechanical and narrative minutia. It was sooooo nerdy, and we loved it.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu was a late night foray for most of the winter of '88. Such a cool game and so different to anything else we had roleplayed. A new group of gamers for me and a far more 'rules light' expression of the d20 game than I had ever experienced. Watching other GMs practice their craft is always a revelation to me. CoC taught me that Props matter, and so does atmosphere. <br/><br/>At this time WHFRP reared its unmistakable head, and a few of us from the warhammer tabletop battles group gave it a whirl. Despite feeling very 'railroady', the Enemy Within was one of my favourite ever campaigns to play in, especially after the crunch and technical flimflammery of trying to fit Rolemaster to Middle Earth (ugh). We especially focused on the 'grit' side of things, and lavished on the 'east end' character of this game. Every ne'rdo'well spoke in a cockney accent, our character flags were the means to advance into the heady careers like Witchhunter and Dragonslayer. I loved playing in the old world, the harkening back to roleplay via wargaming (like D&amp;D had done previously) and the I have since bought the 3e, but despite loving the dicepool mechanic and lavish production, prefer the rules simplicity and setting depth of the 1e rules.<br/><br/>Real life then intruded. The mid to late 90's and early century years were a dearth of deep, immersive gaming for me. D&amp;D 2+held no allure, either did MtG, but that's what everybody was playing. Gaming fell by the wayside of the odd Talisman or SpaceHulk game. Any roleplaying that occured was either with my Brothers playing Moldvay D&amp;D or the odd abortive WoD Live Roleplay event or convention 3.5 D&amp;D nightmare. I hardly Roleplayed for maybe 6 or 7 years. I experimented with LARPing after becoming increasingly dis-enfranchised with the historical (metal edge) re-enactment scene with all its bickering and peusdo-professor debate. Only to find the LARPing I got involved with had a similar 'look at me' syndrome combined with an overabundance of combat muchkin min-maxing rather than actual roleplay. Sigh. That group has folded, though there is a burgeoning scene in Melbourne at present!<br/><br/>I then found the indie-game scene after an odd internet search and bought Burning Wheel. I was so enthused to start Roleplaying again! Story games?! Co-authoringYES PLEASE!  The rest is history. I have no desire to play games out of the 90's, though I have recently dabbled with 4e and had a story game blast! I have a distinct reminiscent air with all things OSR, and love making dungeons for my Moldvay game as lonely DM fun <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Its been wonderful to understand that system matters and that games don't need to be house-ruled to be fun, you have so many other games and diverse mechanical ideas out there to try and wonder at and play with. Its so cool.<br/><br/>Dungeon World has been my go-to game as I introduce ever increasing non-gamers to roleplaying, I am enjoying my gaming so much now, its incredible. The storygames movement through the marvel of the internet  has become my mid-life anti-crisis! Life is sweet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371789/#Comment_371789" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T02:44:34+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  2:44AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2012 3:05AM by Hans_c-o.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to be an outlier, Jonathan, but:<br/><br/><b>First Played (as far as I remember)</b><br/><br/>-D&amp;D 3.5<br/>-random internet dude's homebrew "d&amp;d"<br/>-Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>-Universalis<br/>-Zombie Cinema<br/>-In a Wicked Age<br/>-Call of Cthulhu <br/><br/><b>Experiences</b><br/><br/>I came to roleplaying through videogames. In high school (1999-2002) I got increasingly into niche console JRPGs, and then into CRPGs. I wanted to play the weirdest, most mechanically in-depth stuff. I came across D&amp;D computer games. I wanted to play the tabletop game: it was super weird and in-depth and had funny dice and random tables and what! But D&amp;D was the devil in my house, plus I wanted to be super-cool in high school, so I didn't pursue it too far.<br/><br/>Anyway, at some point in college I bought the D&amp;D books and fawned over them. I knew some folks who played Shadowrun at my school, but they were all super socially awkward, so I didn't want to play with them. Post college I find myself working with high school students, and playing games with them every week (Risk, mostly--how I wish I'd been more into boardgames back then, and had a bigger collection!) I asked if they wanted to play D&amp;D, and they so motherfucking did.<br/><br/>I DMed like 3 sessions of Eberron 3.5, as my first tabletop experience, using modules. I took the rules and advice in the book to heart, in good faith. There's a reason for rules, right? It was mostly pretty fun; I had hand-made a battlemat, had written up handouts (a fancy letter from some fancy NPC), and had a DM screen that I rolled behind and fudged numbers, because that's what the book tells you to do. It's hard for me to believe that this was only like 5 years ago. Anyway. It was a railroad, but the players didn't care; they bantered back and forth in character, we had some fun and not-so-fun fights, there was a map of Eberron tacked up on the wall. I liked it, but I wanted way more. It did not meet my expectations (I did not know what to expect). This experience is probably most relevant to what you're looking for, Jonathan (the rest is my history following this, and it spilled out of me because I like telling it). I was definitely trying to get an interesting, involving story from the characters. We talked about background beforehand and why the characters were together. The players made up important NPCs from their history. And then I ran a module, and none of that mattered! We still had a decent time, but it wasn't what I wanted and I had no clue how to get what I wanted.<br/><br/>I was listening to gaming podcasts at the time, and Paul Tevis (I believe) introduced me to the concept of Dogs in the Vineyard, which sounded fucking amazing to me. "Indie" seemed cool, and I'd wondered pretty much since I bought my first D&amp;D books in 2005 or so why all RPGs had to be about adventure fiction and had to have a party.<br/><br/>Anyway, I moved to the Seattle area, trolled some forums, and played in some random internet dude's D&amp;D homebrew, which was terrible. I did not know how it worked, and he didn't seem to want to tell me, telling me to just "play my character", whatever that meant. We were amnesiacs who had been sucked away from our home planets/planes. I felt like there were clues for us to find to advance the story, and I hated it. I left without ever coming back.<br/><br/>I hooked up with another group online who wanted to play Dogs in the Vineyard. The husband and wife "interviewed" me at a restaurant. We played a terrible game of 3.5 for a few sessions to "get to know each other".<br/><br/>AND THEN! And then. We played Dogs. We had one session of character creation/initial conflict. It was the most face-melting, fucking amazing thing I had ever done in my goddamn life. I remember leaving that apartment with my heart pounding, feeling like my head was on fire. Agency! Excitement! THE THINGS I SAY MATTER AND THE GAME DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES (I had read it).<br/><br/>The next session was <i>awful</i>. It was a mystery game. I stopped the game in the middle and read text from the book to the GM from the "how to GM" section (dick move, sure, but I still think it was the right thing to do), because he clearly had not read it. He ended the game mid session and said, "well, if that's how the game is supposed to be run, I can't do that." It was very amicable and honest: I wanted what the text sold me, he said he couldn't provide that. We played a crappy GURPS game for a couple sessions and I never saw them again.<br/><br/>I went to Conquest NW in 2007, met Ogre and a bunch of folks, played terrible games of Universalis and Call of Cthulhu, and a pretty decent game of In a Wicked Age with Johnzo. I was SUPER excited about Cat, and I played it and it was kind of bad. This is too much of my history. Anyway. I started going to some meetups at a local coffee shop. I played Zombie Cinema, Geiger Counter, etc, which were fun, but I had a <i>hard</i> time with scene framing. Man! It was so difficult. It's fun to look back on that and realize I've really grown in my gaming skills. I GMed one-shot of Mouse Guard for six folks around this time (it was the same time I was playing in the crappy GURPS game), because I was frustrated from lack of agency in the GURPS game and wanted control.<br/><br/>We should stop here. Beers make me say "super" too much and I've gone afield from the original intent of this thread, but I like telling this history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371803/#Comment_371803" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T07:06:49+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  7:06AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2012 7:10AM by Snake_Eyes.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D Basic Age 7?<br/><br/>&gt;Bought the game pocket money from working chores, took me a long time.<br/><br/>&gt;Played in a community event a bit later, run by the local university group during a cultural weekend outside the public library.

No one is going to want to play it and only get criticisms about it (but that just means I am doing something right, right?)<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Snake_Eyes                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos" title="Agemegos"><img alt="Agemegos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Agemegos">Agemegos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372871/#Comment_372871" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T14:56:51+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  2:56PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first RPG I played was <i>AD&amp;D</i>, in 1980. I was 15. My DM played it in the conventional style in which the PCs wandered around a mapped area having encounters keyed to the map, rolling occasionally for wandering monsters. That is, he ran location-driven adventures. But when I moved behind the DM screen that summer (December 1980\u2013January 1981 in this hemisphere) I was immediately interested in emulating fantasy fiction with plot-driven adventures. I ran <i>AD&amp;D</i> as a storytelling game, though I was pretty much of a railroader at first.<br/><br/>I played some <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> in 1981, but it wasn't influential.<br/><br/>At Easter 1981 I played some <i>Traveller</i>, which tended to re-affirm my interest in plot-driven adventures, but I didn't take it up for various reasons (the character generation system was a poor match for the SF I was reading at the time, and none of us liked the combat system or equipment lists).<br/><br/>In early 1982 (now at uni) I took up <i>The Fantasy Trip</i> which (bizarrely, given how board-gamey the rules are) I tried to run storytelling style. I also played in others' <i>D&amp;D</i> and <i>Rolemaster</i> campaigns, which had a mostly negative influence. I took one glance at the cover of <i>DragonQuest</i> and so disliked what the cover illustation suggested the game was about that I never even opened it. Then in early 1984 I looked at <i>Mercenaries, Spies, and Private Eyes</i>, rejected it as being based on T&amp;T's dysfunctional mechanics, and then took up <i>Justice, Inc.</i> (the Hero System version for adventures based on the pulps).<br/><br/><i>Justice, Inc.</i>, used to run story-based games, was my staple through 1986, which is when I started at ANU. Played some <i>Champions</i>, <i>Bushido</i>, <i>RuneQuest</i>, <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, <i>James Bond 007</i> etc. at ANU, and towards the end of 1986 adopted <i>ForeSight</i>, an SF RPG that I used as a generic "general-purpose RPG" as long as I could find players who had copies.<br/><br/>I've played perhaps a couple of dozen other RPGs since: <i>Castle Falkenstein</i>, <i>Legend of the Five Rings</i>, <i>DragonQuest</i>, <i>Vampire: the Masquerade</i>, <i>Werewolf: the Apocalypse</i>, two different <i>Star Wars the RPG</i>s,<i> Immortal: the Invisible War</i>, <i>Space: 1889</i>, <i>Top Secret</i>, <i>Chivalry &amp; Sorcery</i>, <i>Ghosts of Albion</i>, <i>In Nomine</i>, <i>GURPS</i>, <i>CyberPunk 2020</i>, <i>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</i>, <i>Hunter Planet</i>, <i>D&amp;D 3rd editon</i>, the <i>Dying Earth RPG</i>, one of the later <i>Traveller</i> games, an Arthurian RPG whose name escapes me, most recently <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, and doubtless others that slip my mind just now. The lasting influence of most of those games was a strong disinclination to having to learn new systems to play particular genres and settings: I really do like having a single, highly-capable set of rules that doesn't impose on the setting or style, and using that for everything. I also became deeply exasperated with RPG rules that just don't work (eg. <i>Bushido</i>'s okuden and character-in-battle rules, <b>Storyteller</b>'s dice pool mechanics and the combat manoeuvres in <i>Werewolf</i>, <i>Space 1889</i>'s R&amp;D rules).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373035/#Comment_373035" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T05:25:59+00:00" title="April 16, 2012  5:25AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, the first significant games were:<br/><br/>AD&amp;D 2nd<br/>Call of Cthulhu 1st<br/>Star Wars d6 1st<br/><br/>I started role-playing around 1989 or 1990, at age 12 or 13.

Told me it was like Lord of The Rings so I tried to make Gandalf and then had a terrible time as my 1st level Wizard couldn't do 90% of what I wrote in the backstory they asked me to make up. It wasn't D&amp;D's fault but the experience I was promised and what the actual game delivered weren't even close. <br/><br/><b>Marvel (FASERIP) </b>got me back into RPGs.<br/><br/>Then I played:<br/><br/><b>Star Wars (WEG d6)<br/>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<br/>Robotech<br/>DC (2d10 chart)<br/>Paranoia<br/>Shadowrun</b><br/><br/>I didn't understand or know most of the rules. We just told awesome (to us) stories or acted out immersive what if scenarios. The GMs used the rules as toolkits and hacked them based on whatever story they wanted to tell, situation they wanted us to experience, puzzle to solve, movie/book/comic to emulate. Lots of fun.<br/><br/>In college we played:<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D Players Option in Planescape, Darksun, and Ravenloft.<br/>Vampire<br/>Mage<br/>D&amp;D 3E<br/>Call of Cthulhu D20<br/>Mutants &amp; Masterminds<br/>Spycraft<br/>LARPs</b><br/><br/>This is when I started learning the rules and GMing. We rotated GMs so almost everyone took a turn. <br/><br/>Took a break from RPGs to focus on work.<br/><br/>Came back once my job settled down and started playing\u2026<br/><br/><b>Buffy The Vampire Slayer<br/>Cthulhu BRP</b><br/><br/>\u2026not for the rules but because they attracted the best players. <br/><br/>Then I discovered indie games\u2026<br/><br/><b>Sorcerer<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>PTA<br/>With Great Power<br/>Burning Wheel</b><br/><br/>\u2026which led me to GMing more and more with a huge variety of people. This was the same time I rediscovered a love for boardgames and I started organizing gaming events. Gaming became less about specific games or types of gaming and more about community. <br/><br/>And now I've played way too many games to list in detail: indie games, D&amp;D 4E, OSR games, new games, old games, and more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
