It would be a relatively simple matter to make 81 cards representing the -4 to +4 spread that Fudge dice represent. (I found that printable perforated business cards worked well for making item cards for Maid RPG by the way).<br/><br/>But just putting the same probability spread on cards wouldn't really accomplish much. I want to come up with something more interesting to justify using the cards. The possibilities that occurred to me so far are:<br/><br/>* Symbols that can form combos for special effects.<br/>* Markings for generating different numbers or other things with the cards.<br/>* Some kind of meta-story thingy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153905/#Comment_153905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T13:54:21+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  1:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!<br/>What are you looking for, for this topic?<br/>I've thought of something with cards for Blood in the Thickets!<br/>I'm very happy!<br/>Are you looking to fish for ideas or to farm an already existing idea?

Make two decks, draw one card from each. Now each minimal deck is 9 cards (ranging from -2 to +2). Try and divy the descriptors up such that you should always be able to combine them. Note that you will only ever have to combine a positive and negative descriptor for the marginal result range of -1 to +1. Now make each deck 36 cards, and now you have 16 combinations of descriptors for a +4 (and with 4 copies, you can even just draw off the deck and reshuffle say when only half the deck is left or something and not have the draws get too predictable (with a single sequence of 81 -4 to +4 cards, as soon as the +4 card is drawn, we know we won't draw another, and almost anyone can count the -3 and +3 cards).<br/><br/>Hmm, with the two decks, you could even have some interesting strategy with a hand of say 6 cards (3 from each deck). Do you play your two +2s (one from each deck) for a single +4, or do you play them with one of your -1s to gain a couple marginal successes instead of one major success and one failure?<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154263/#Comment_154263" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-01T18:37:28+00:00" title="July  1, 2008  6:37PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be darned if I remember who or where, but this has been done, and you may want to look at the results.
