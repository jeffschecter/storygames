First, though, two things:<br/><br/>1) Deliverator Matt totally ran with the pacing dial, both speeding through some "cover the bases" investigations and slowing down to examine a nasty injury.  The other players seemed to develop a sense of pacing too.  This left my poor GM brain completely free to focus on the fiction and the fun of the moment, rather than checking the clock and manhandling the pace.<br/><br/>2) The indie roundtable was all about helping me <i>better</i> represent the game in a one-shot.  My players were all eager to tell me to trim my intro spiel.  So there is still much work to be done!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kate%20Bullock" title="Kate Bullock"><img alt="Kate Bullock" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/369/nDTB5PI7ZR748.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kate%20Bullock">Kate Bullock</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258569/#Comment_258569" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T16:54:39+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  4:54PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't get a chance to play Delve, but sat through some of the roundtable.

Any way I could get some highlights/information, Dave? <br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to run a sandbox type game with player infused plot and theme. I run with it, and generally my games are known to be pretty fun (so they say, I'm still uncertain on this). The investigator free-style of play you mentioned has me intrigued.

Is there anything about it that you're looking to change?  If so, you could start a thread about that, and I'll try to weigh in.<br/><br/>Delve is a game of discovering supernatural secrets.  "Uncovering the hidden world behind the normal world," as Rich Flynn recently put it.  <br/><br/>On the sandboxy front, it's a cycle of <b>play -&gt; pick what next -&gt; prep</b>.  This way, the GM doesn't waste time prepping stuff that's never used.  It's very different than the epic meta-plots I used to craft in my early GMing days.  Both cool in their different ways.  <br/><br/>As for free-play investigation, that all comes down to scenario design.  My focus is mainly on making sure clues link up and keep things moving toward solution time, and then injecting some good challenges (based on polled player taste) for drama and excitement.  <br/><br/>There's more tidbits over <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/" rel="nofollow">nyah</a>.<br/><br/>Delve is really campaign-oriented, thus Paul's question about beating it into a con slot.

I hurried players through fleshing out personality details.  I trimmed my intro spiel down to the most concise verbiage I could manage.  ...and it still took 50 minutes.  This was not good for a con slot.<br/><br/>What <i>was</i> good was the adventure itself.  Specifically, the way I wrote it down.  I did my usual amount of prep in terms of creating scenario facts -- clues, agents, obstacles, etc. -- but I wrote it down in a flow chart.  The nodes were correlated with scenes.  Each scene had no more than two arrows to other potential scenes.  Having it laid out this way reminded me to make sure the arrows existed in the fiction -- that scene 4 <i>would tell</i> the players to go to scene 8.<br/><br/>Actually, I don't even know if it was the visual design of the chart so much as the fact that I actually thought to look at it during play.  Often I get so lost in the fiction that I forget to check my notes.  Hmm.  Well, my best guess right now is that it was both.<br/><br/>I usually create a scenario by drawing cards and writing down a very few notes on what each one means in this scenario.  Instead, this time I just made up tasks (challenges + roleplay opportunities + "be cool" moments) first, and dug through the cards afterward to assign whatever fit best.  This was less fun, but the results were more constrained and predictable.  I could count through and say, "Maximum of 12 scenes, and I can make it 8 by following this path on teh flow chart instead of this one if time demands it."  When I wing it from the cards, I tend not to script in as much efficiency, instead letting play inspire me to fill in some blanks.<br/><br/>Really, I am a lazy GM, and I want to make Delve work for other GMs as lazy as me.  I spent 90 minutes prepping 3 adventures for Dreamation.  That 30 mins each is longer than I usually spend.<br/><br/>Anyway, due to all these alterations, plus Matt handling pacing, we finished an entire adventure scenario in 2 hrs 50 mins.  It wrapped up just how I like it to: Frank had a brilliant idea for using a trophy monster paw to slice a magical tapestry, and Matt tried a desperate use of an innocuous special item at the perfect moment.  Hell yeah!!!<br/><br/>They immediately started reasoning through what the aftermath should be, but I wanted to break with the energy still high, so we did.  (This is generally a good idea; my home game benefits when i do this.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258609/#Comment_258609" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T22:37:11+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 10:37PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your kind words about me here and elsethread.<br/><br/>One thing that's a bit weird for me about the whole meta-gaming / author stance versus "just playing your character" divide is that I almost literally don't experience it.
