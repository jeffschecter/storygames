Should be 2-3 session to test that to satisfaction. I'm considering doing a whole series of these during the coming months, concentrating on the stuff that I think requires playtesting the most. Fortunately there is much in a setting book that needs no playtesting, too; otherwise I'd be doing too much of it.<br/><br/>So anyways, if you want to playtest Ammeni going to colonize Qek, feel free to hit it whenever you feel like it. Or ask questions if I don't explain something there - I presume some system and setting expertise in that thread, so it's not as clear as the final text is going to be. No particular reason to hit this playtest if you don't feel like it; I already have some indications that a group is going to take this to a swing. Wait for the next one if you'd like. I also discuss what I'm trying to do in more detail in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27308.0" rel="nofollow">yet another thread</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183284/#Comment_183284" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T02:17:08+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  2:17AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Side question: What's up with TSOY 2. edition?

I told him OK, I can do that, but then I'm going to use that license and publish a new edition, too. Then I wrote and published the rules of the game as "Solar System", and am now in the process of writing the new setting sourcebook as well. So here we are. I've collected the whole story <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/tsoy/" rel="nofollow">at my blog</a>.<br/><br/>Also: it's third edition I'm writing. The last one was second. Although I'm thinking of not calling it "3rd", but rather something like "2009 edition", just to emphasize that it's not by the same guy or the same company as the last one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
