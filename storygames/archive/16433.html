Specifically, I've been only peripherally aware that "cultural appropriation" is a <i>thing</i> with a name that people use routinely, and that there are moral viewpoints involved with it. Live and learn, and here's a chance for me to learn more. Specifically, if I'm doing something where I should morally speaking be doing better, I'm interested in knowing the arguments and judging for myself. (Or having somebody else be the judge, whatever - as long as I'm convinced as well, otherwise it's not going to do much good to me practically.)<br/><br/>I'll tell you how I understand this thing, to begin with. First, the definition: cultural appropriation is where you "take" something that "belongs" to some culture you are not part of. So making a computer game about cowboys and indians is cultural appropriation, because you're using the IP (not literally in the legal sense, but it's the same idea - cultures should own their heritage) of native American tribes to make money. Building a sauna is appropriating Finnish culture. That sort of thing. I understand that it's especially considered evil (I'm in total philosophical mode here, so saying things as I understand them) when your appropriation is shallow and you're taking from people in a weak position, who are not in a position to exploit their own culture themselves.<br/><br/>Also, I figured that this has to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation" rel="nofollow">a Wikipedia article</a> on it. I see that it has a more nuanced view on the matter. There are even arguments there about how cultures can learn from each other, and how appropriation of influences enrichens us all. The alternate viewpoint that occurs to me while considering this idea is that creative work is largely appropriating cultures. How could that be bad? Can you appropriate your own culture? What is the difference? How about, can you utilize your own culture's understanding of a different culture, or is that just more appropriation?<br/><br/>If you're into this thing, let's discuss cultural appropriation in roleplaying, both play and game texts. To start off, I'd like to present exhibit A, an excerpt of text from a D&amp;D adventure I wrote last year; it's being published in the Fight On! magazine soon. The text describes GMing instructions for how to treat an imperial Chinese city a bit before the Opium War in the context of a one-shottish D&amp;D adventure.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Foo Dogs of the Heavenly Jade Temple</cite>The referee may provide a map for the city, but for the purposes of the convention environment outlined above the city is more of a distraction than an opportunity: the referee happily describes Amoy and its adventures, allows the players to get lost in its exotic mysteries, and closes the session with utter failure for the HEIC mission.<br/><br/>The PCs may opt to wander the city and verify for themselves that it's a modern yet exotic locale of a culture with a rather different history than their own. My take as referee would be to keep orientalist glasses on all the way through: emphasize the inscrutability of the citizens and cast a wide mix of suspicions and fears at any European PCs, who will see fearsome arts and mind-boggling ignorance mixed up, inviting totalizing interpretations that cast the Chinese civilization as a whole in the role of mysterious super-people or reprehensible degenerates, or both at once. The cultural context of the PCs makes this place look like Menzoberranzan to any without experience of Chinese locales.<br/><br/>The reactions of the locals to any "foreign devils" will be magnified, they will point and gape as PCs travel the streets. Many are hostile or fearful, as the imperial creed has demonized foreigners for a long time; others will be curious and seek out the foreigners for their supposed amazing powers or superior knowledges (or entertainment value, as the case might be). The party may make purchases of most types of equipment in the city with the preferred amount of folderol regarding currency exchanges and haggling and widely variant prices offered to the exotic customers.</blockquote>\nSo, that's appropriation, I think. Furthermore, I'm not just appropriating Chinese culture, but rather I'm appropriating the culture of 18th century European orientalists (who were in turn appropriating from the Chinese) and using it as a instructional backbone in advising a GM on how to treat an exotic locale at their table. Good stuff? Bad stuff? Racist stuff? For myself I was very satisfied at my take here - I got the idea for the adventure first, and then had to think for a couple of minutes about how to transmit a functional picture of the city of Amoy in a very tight space. Then I realized that actually, the most true to life and flavourful way of doing this would be to go to town with the way this era is traditionally depicted in European sources, as that would then contrast beautifully with the types of exotism you usually see in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Considering my piece and my reaction to it, should I be ashamed, or in general, is there something that I'm obviously not considering here morally. Am I using my arts for vile purposes without even realizing it myself?<br/><br/>If you have any thoughts on cultural appropriation, or your own examples to consider, or comments on my specific example, feel free to discuss!

First I'll just note that my text above strictly speaking only assumes that the player characters are European; that's part of the adventure hook, they're working for the English far east trade company as special agents. I did not admittedly think about the player background in any special way, I was just writing game text that'd be intelligible to the OSR crowd while also being good stuff.<br/><br/>But be that as it may, what is racism? I'm curious, because the way I've learned to use that word, it indicates a type of essentialism (a philosophical model that attributes many disparate superficial features to certain essential root causes) that uses human ethnicity as an explanatory tool. That is, you're being a racist if you explain a phenomenon as being ultimately or essentially caused by race. (I'm not hung up on this, I'm just explaining what the word brings to mind first.)<br/><br/>Considering from this viewpoint, I would not call it racism if a game text assumes that the reader is non-Chinese. It's just a focused target audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375595/#Comment_375595" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T14:41:02+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  2:41PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference is that <i>Sengoku</i> was the result of actual research into real Japanese culture, rather than snapshots of stuff taken from anime and 70s Hong Kong kung fu movies.

Cultural appropriation, when it's problematic, is usually about someone from a more privileged culture borrowing from a culture that's historically been disenfranchised and is currently less privileged. <br/><br/>I think <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/10/07/the_danger_of_a/" rel="nofollow">This TED talk</a> also brings an interesting dimension to this.<br/><br/>Your example doesn't seem like cultural appropriation to me so much as orientalism, and presented with an ironic distance that makes it very complex to analyse. Seems to me like that text could be read either as a mild critique of that kind of orientalism, or an invitation to enjoy such stereotypes (my reading is more the former, but I can see how an individual instance of play of this could be really tasteless).<br/><br/>(Crossposted with everyone)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375599/#Comment_375599" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T14:43:43+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  2:43PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 2:46PM by PeterBB.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think appropriation is most often used in situations where taking someone's culture out of context cheapens or disrespects it. Like using ritual/sacred clothing for a Halloween costume, that sort of thing. It's part of a colonial tradition that puts western convenience and entertainment above even the most deeply important parts of someone's life. I don't think your text is appropriation in that way.<br/><br/>There's a separate concern that your text might be contributing to Orientalism, or "othering" of non-Western cultures, but you seem pretty self-aware about that. I would have liked just a bit more about how the PCs are wrong in their totalizing interpretations (and ways those false ideas might be interesting in play), but off-hand and without context it doesn't strike me as overly problematic.<br/><br/>EDIT: Obviously I'm no expert here, and as a white guy I can only go so far in knowing what is going to be problematic to other people.

What I would say is that I would feel uncomfortable playing that module; that it clearly assumes that I'm playing a European and forces me into that mold when that's not what I generally picture myself as when I'm playing D&amp;D; that I would be embarrassed and insulted by any exaggerated "Chinese" business such as the paragraph suggests; and that reading or hearing the words "orientalist" or "inscrutability" would make me feel extremely awkward and insulted, tying in as they do into the worst stereotypes of Asian culture, things which are both offensively simplistic and which I have to deal with all the time. If I were younger I think this module would make me feel even more that denying my Asian heritage and identifying as much as possible as white is the only way for me to be comfortable even in the games I play, a feeling I struggled with for years. If I were newer to roleplaying I think I'd feel pretty excluded, since this module doesn't give me the chance to play a character like myself, and the characters that appear that ARE like me are stereotyped and described as strange and baffling. If this were the first game I played I doubt I'd want to come back.<br/><br/>That's basically my reaction to it, and that's what I would call appropriation, and why I think it's a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375607/#Comment_375607" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T14:58:46+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  2:58PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>The difference is that<i>Sengoku</i>was the result of actual research into real Japanese culture, rather than snapshots of stuff taken from anime and 70s Hong Kong kung fu movies.

What I'm getting at is, do you think that it's problematic to ever do an exclusively European D&amp;D adventure, or is it just that you yourself don't like that kind of thing? I mean, it seems like sort of a shame to be unable to do scenarios about e.g. the Opium Wars from the viewpoint of the Europeans because that is exclusive towards people who are not European. I say this as a person interested in European history and identity, obviously. Going the other way is perhaps not as difficult, as I imagine that many people of dominant ethnicities don't have similar hang-ups: I myself, for example, don't think much about playing a character who is of a different race than myself, and I can totally understand why - I've never had to care about my race in the real world, so it's not like I'm going to see it as a huge step to play e.g. an oriental ethnicity in TSoY.<br/><br/>For a bit more context on that same adventure, here's how the text treats playing non-westerners:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Foo Dogs of the Heavenly Jade Temple</cite>Convention and Tournament Play<br/>This adventure, hook and all, was originally written as a convention one-shot. Some considerations, should you wish to do the same:<br/>\u2022 Prepare to run character generation in under ten minutes, it's possible if you drop equipment purchase - use prepared equipment packs instead. All characters are first level, unless a player brings his own, in which case inspect the character and revise as needed. The referee may also wish to ask the players about their prior experience with old school D&amp;D; the group may choose to unanimously allow players with considerable prior experience to generate characters at level 1d6, but only if they can do it without slowing the game down. In any case only allow one character at level &gt;3.<br/>\u2022 Native characters are allowed, and will have an advantage in cultural terms among the Chinese. However, a racist by-law is in force in the HEIC: if at least half of the PCs are of a single culture (usually western), then the members of all minorities will only be entitled to half shares of xp and treasure. The only exception are minority characters for whom successful Charisma checks are made to establish genuine friendship with the majority; each character may attempt this once per session for themselves or somebody else. (The party may override the HEIC by-law and institute their own after a single successful venture, although that's likely not pertinent in convention context.)<br/>\u2022 Demi-Human characters are allowed grudgingly, but the racist by-law applies to them as well. Additionally, Chinese will find demi-humans just as exotic as Europeans do; only play one if you enjoy being the focus of fascination with the exotic and fear of the unknown.<br/>\u2022 Local knowledge: For each European character the player is free to choose how many years the character has spent in the Orient. For each full three years make a Constitution check and an Intelligence check: failing the former indicates that the character has lost 1d3-1 in Wisdom and Constitution to the ravages of the oriental lifestyle; succeeding in the latter allows the character to possess a working knowledge of one language or similar topic of local knowledge; tripling up on a single language indicates near-native proficiency. Cantonese is a good idea, that being the local dialect.<br/>\u2022 Replacement characters may be further crew of Ceylon, paid mercenaries from the city (50 sp or whatever the players agree upon) or monks from Lo-Chiang-Ze, all at 1st level. No replacements during the last hour of play.<br/>\u2022 Time-limit is that the Indiaman Ceylon will leave harbor 30 minutes before the convention play slot ends, and abandon the party for good (ending the scenario) when time runs out entirely. The players should be made aware of both of these time limits at the same time, whenever they think to ask (although captain Warley won't know his exact departure date before the Chinese warn him). Also, consider using a timer on the table to emphasize the play schedule: the adventure is very much intended to test the organizational ability of the players to actually get shit done under a reasonable time-frame.</blockquote>\n(Reading that, I should note that I use the term "racist" in a very inexact manner there, in an attempt to be encompassing of the reasons behind the rule. And yes, that's still totally orientalist genre trappings, even if it does allow you to play Chinese characters.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375621/#Comment_375621" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T15:25:10+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  3:25PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...<br/><br/>I'm sorry, what's the HEIC?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375623/#Comment_375623" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T15:28:21+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  3:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This part is you, Eero, being racist:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>\u2022 Native characters are allowed, and will have an advantage in cultural terms among the Chinese.

You define cultural appropriation thus:\n<blockquote>cultural appropriation is where you "take" something that "belongs" to some culture you are not part of</blockquote>\nI submit that this definition can be improved upon in two ways, that will help focus the discussion better on the problematic aspects.<br/><br/>First, when someone raises a complaint of "cultural appropriation", it's not really that they're claiming that their culture belongs to them. I think it's more like, these are cultural practices that someone <i>identifies with</i>, that they are important for their own understanding of who they are and how they live. In other words, it's not "This belongs to me", but rather "This means something important to me".<br/><br/>Second, the problem with appropriation is not that someone else is "taking" those practices. It's not Western cultural appropriation when Indians wear business suits, or when Arabs go to a Finnish sauna. The problem is when someone emulates a practice without understanding it, or represents it in a distorted way. The appropriator uses a symbol or practice as a superficial way to denote a culture or a way of life, but by taking the thing out of context, without much concern for whether they understand the practice or are doing it correctly.<br/><br/>The more precarious a culture's position relative to the culture of the appropriator, the more damaging appropriation can be. It can be damaging even when it's well intentioned, because it can still have the effect of belittling others and trivializing their identity and their way of life. That's why the "I'm not racist" defense isn't particularly credible. Cultural appropriation is lazy racism; it's not that the appropriator has negative feelings they ought not to have, but that they don't have the bona fides they ought to have. It's a kind of moral negligence.<br/><br/>I dunno if this helps, but a European example might be, when someone wears a head scarf and hoop earrings to signify the romantic stereotype of Gypsy life. Because Gyspsies are cooooooool. Except, the actual lives of actual Romani people can be pretty hard scrabble and dangerous. To this day they're the targets of forcible assimilation tantamount to genocide in some "enlightened" Western countries. But they also have their own art and other cultural enterprises that speak to that history and to their contemporary condition. What it means for a non-Romani to play at being a Gypsy has little connection to what it means <i>to a Romani</i> to be a Romani, to be part of a history of Romani in Europe. And that's something people who dress up as Gypsies when they go to costume parties generally don't give the first crap about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375630/#Comment_375630" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T15:51:30+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  3:51PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This part struck me as more problematic:\n<blockquote>\u2022 Local knowledge: For each European character the player is free to choose how many years the character has spent in the Orient.

You're drawing on 19th century European perspectives of China, which are racist. So, not much question there. Rather, think about whether it's offensive or not. Portraying disrespectful behaviour is not offensive, being disrespectful is. Playing in a setting that is racist is different than acting racist yourself, outside of the fiction. And even playing racist characters is different than being racist yourself -- I mean, this is old school D&amp;D, a magnification of early British archaeology and its sort-of enemy blatant tomb robbing, and it pretty much requires some sort of appropriation in order to make unexplored locations unfamiliar.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Well, I wrote that bit about the racist difficulties in the spirit of the old school D&amp;D method: don't shy from the difficulties and challenges, and treat them equitably and logically within the setting.</blockquote>\nSure, I get that, I'm not calling you out for including racism in the setting. But xp is not part of the fiction, it is a game element that exists for the players. Genre trappings are things that happen in the game, not stuff you're supposed to do in "real life."  Granted, if the way xp is divided up is based on treasure, then the in-fiction racist requirements of the PCs' employers will affect the xp of the characters accordingly, but not everybody divides up xp that way (I don't, for example -- I divvy out xp equally, regardless of who gets what treasure), and telling the DM to divvy it out based on whether the players' characters are white or Chinese is asking the person to act in a racist manner towards fictional representations of actual people. Not quite as bad as divvying up xp based on what race the players themselves are, but getting pretty close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375635/#Comment_375635" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T16:00:31+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  4:00PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 4:02PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I think regardless of whether or not differentiated XP and treasure is racist, what it definitely does is provides negative incentives against forming a diverse party.

This tells me a LOT more about the European characters who are in "the Orient" than it does about the Orient itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375639/#Comment_375639" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T16:11:47+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  4:11PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone,<br/><br/>Fair enough. That's certainly a possible interpretation, and one I'd be inclined to depending on the context. The whole text kind of treads that line, where it's presenting this ironic view of Orientalist tropes, but at the same time, if we're so critical of these ideas, why are we playing a game where we indulge in them so much?

I knew that this adventure would be topical here.<br/><br/>I'll discuss the D&amp;D nuances a bit here. I don't think that they're the main topic of the thread, and I don't want you to get the impression that I need to defend myself and prove myself right. I'll just tell you how I myself thought about these things:<ul><li>Experience points are not only an out of game concern, and it depends hugely on the local methodology how they're treated, exactly. I think that it's evident in the context that I'm offering optional, compact guidance about how to set up this scenario in a one-shot context. The OSR gamemaster would presumably know to ignore any advice that goes against their established method. So that entire part is more of a "look how quirky games I run" rather than rules. Insofar as my own game matters, at my own table the part about half treasure is an in-fiction thing (that is, the characters themselves agree to half shares), while the xp part is basically genre stylization (and of course the fact that you get xp for treasure, so half treasure is half xp); it's just like if I said that you don't get xp for killing these baby monsters, for example.</li><li>Frankly, a party should be able to get by on the "he's a good chink" clause I put in that racist by-law. It is, of course, still a racist setting phenomenon that you need a qualification letter from the majority to not get kicked, but that's life in the HEIC. I would totally expect players to take as many Chinese characters as they need; the advantages are obvious in an adventure that happens in China, and if nobody at all can succeed in one of the dozen Charisma checks implied, then that's just massive bad luck.</li><li>Kicking player characters is basically what old school D&amp;D scenarios do. I have no pity for characters (not players, note - it's not nice if anybody gets sad) who are in difficult situations, because the entire game is in a certain way sadistic: you push the characters hard, and you see what they can do. Dealing with racism among your supposed comrades is just a part of that, the players are supposed to laugh at how horrible their characters are towards each other in this cruel setting.</li><li>Johnstone gets it about the "local knowledge" clause: that rule does not depict oriental lifestyle of the natives, it depicts what the Europeans are like who go to the Orient. It depicts the orientalist genre, one might say; the orient is somehow dark and weird and horrid upon your constitution, and you come back a changed man, possibly mad or taken by nightmares. Of course the cause is not Asia itself. Succintly, I can only plead that I put the "oriental lifestyle" there ironically, following the viewpoint of the gentlemen who went there and found that they could live like animals away from home. "Good heavens, Jim, the oriental lifestyle must have taken quite a toll on your constitution over the last year!" (Sure, it wasn't his new drug-dealer's opium habit that did him in, not at all, it was "the orient".)</li></ul>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I can totally see there being a payoff in the strategic context of the D&amp;D scenario, for example if success in the adventure depends on successfully discriminating between actual threats and perceived threats, which are confused because of the orientalist environment.

On the other hand this is a stylistic issue: I wrote this adventure in the <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i> context, which is the context of Euro-centric colonial fantasy adventure. It's the genre of Solomon Kane and such, and it's totally about supposedly protagonistic Europeans going and bringing light to the dark corners of the world. It's not a realistic setting, but rather stylized and romantized and today also constantly deconstructed, a way for us Europeans to explore a period of our history. I personally think that the entire LotFP setting is racist as hell - or rather, exactly as racist as the world was in the 18th century. This doesn't mean that player characters have to be - or the players for that matter! When we play this kind of stuff the players tend to either act ironically according to the cultural context of their characters, or they'll be exceptionally enlightened and liberal for their time-frame. I don't think that the thematic content of the game as we play it is inhuman or unsympathetic; if it's something thematically, then it's sad and ironic about the supposed "heroism" of the player characters.<br/><br/>But that's just our game table, and of course everybody thinks that their play is great. The game text interests me more, especially in terms of procedures and guidelines: what is allowable to be written, and what is not in good taste, or even: what is evil and wrong against our fellow men who might play roleplaying games without being white-skinned? Or wrong against ourselves, as the case might be, by stunting our own growth as human beings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375650/#Comment_375650" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T16:53:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  4:53PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 4:55PM by J_Walton.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, to start at the beginning with the passage you initially quoted, I can honestly tell you right now that I would walk away from that game. I've had the experience of being a foreigner in an Asian country I didn't understand, and I wouldn't want to play in a game that tried to mimick that unless it was carefully structured by someone who had the same sorts of experiences---someone who really knew how uncomfortable and problematic that is---and your guidance seems to be basically telling the GM to wing it based on partial understandings and stereotypes. That's not really a safe environment or structure for dealing with these kinds of issues, at least not in my mind. If I played in that game, what would I do if one of my fellow players starting saying truly abominable, racist things about Chinese people, just to be "in-character"? That makes me sick just thinking about it, honestly, whether there are Asian players at the table or not (both options are equally terrifying, for different reasons).<br/><br/>I don't think the overall concept or intentions are awful. I tried to write a game about orientalism for Game Chef this year, in fact, that tries to capture the experience of being a foreigner in a strange Asian metropolis. But, in doing so, I tried to construct a safe(r) situation in which players aren't given free reign to express whatever ugliness or ignorance they have about China and "exotic" locations, but operate in a much more restricted and structured fashion. Basically, my game seeks to educate them about certain things and only give them leeway to take actions that are appropriate to the game and unlikely to be socially damaging or discomforting to their fellow players. I realize that's partially a design decision, but I think---especially when dealing with problematic topics---that doing so in a responsible way is important.<br/><br/>Overall, labelling things as "racist" or "not racist" or "a little bit racist" only gets us so far, especially if that becomes a reason to stop talking. Erick Wujcik seemed like a great person and an innovative game designer (I think I only met him once, in passing), but <i>Ninjas &amp; Superspies</i> seems pretty problematic to me, though I have more experience with its supplement, <i>Mystic China</i>. Both of those books may been way ahead of their time in terms of engaging Asian cultures in a more serious way, but they still fall way short of what I hope we would aspire to in terms of treating real-world cultures with compassion and respect. And we could have a productive discussion about that, strive to do better, and maybe even discover ways to approach those games that make them less likely to promote stereotypes and harmful depictions of other people. So I hope that noting that something seems pretty racist or problematic doesn't stop the conversation, but is an invitation to begin one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375653/#Comment_375653" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T17:05:56+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  5:05PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a distressing viewpoint, Jonathan, as it sort of casts a strong question at my home game: I would not like to think that it's so awful that Jonathan wouldn't want to play with us.<br/><br/>This is actually something I want to be a tiny bit defensive about: my defense is that D&amp;D as we play it is a focused challenge-oriented game. It has a powerful ironic layer. The real-world stuff is not intended seriously, it's more of an inspirational baseline and cultural context for what happens. I mean, the game has plenty of extremely complex concerns, but they're mostly not cultural. I wrote that adventure without saying explicitly that it's set in a fantasy-China (about as China as the fantasy-Europe on D&amp;D is Europe), but that's just because it was easier and ultimately more clear for the adapting GM to work this way. I've never had a player express a genuine racist opinion at the game table that I'd have noticed it.<br/><br/>That being said, I can't get away from the fact that the adventure is basically inspired by Buddhism and some random Chinese lore. It's going to be rude towards anybody who doesn't want to see Buddhist folklore turned into a D&amp;D adventure. I'm very interested by the fact that this might be problematic, as I was mostly delighted at my cleverness and the fresh D&amp;D environment I got by mixing in a bit of Buddhism. I've been thinking of expanding on the fantasy cosmology implied by the adventure, in fact, which is certainly a problem for <i>me</i> if I've turned into a one-man racist pamphlet factory without noticing it myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375655/#Comment_375655" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T17:11:17+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  5:11PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 5:21PM by Emeraude.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aculturation and re-purposing of cultural elements from one culture to another is, I'd argue, natural, healthy, and integral part of cultural ecosystems.<br/>Linguistically, we do it all the time.

It's certainly, definitely not a realistic model of how people learn things. You don't get the sort of stuff D&amp;D characters get by just growing more experienced in any kind of real world. Experience points thus are a score-keeping device while experience levels are genre fantasy. One is used to pace the other for complex reasons that are not pertinent here. It's notable that characters get experience points in old school D&amp;D in extremely arbitrary ways: even without going into my own home game, the common practice recognizes ideas like quest experience ("The party gets 5000 xp if they escort the prisoners out alive.") and experience penalties for things like not roleplaying your character class or switching your alignment. My halving the experience points of ethnic minorities working for the HEIC in that scenario is just another clever little bit like this. As a designer I find the bold cut of that suggested treatment interesting: not because of the racist element, but because it treats player characters unevenly and invites the party to deal with that.<br/><br/>As for how the scenario treats European characters in the orient, it's just a peculiar scenario rules detail. It's not a fundamental rule of the setting or system procedure, it's a trickier thing than that, technically - something that doesn't really appear in later types of games. These old-style D&amp;D scenarios are full of similar rules bits that are given in the spirit of providing a quirky local subgames without any thought as to the greater campaign setting. I would obviously assume that a GM using this adventure in a campaign context wouldn't need to use the HEIC or the framing device that abstracts time spent in the Orient, because he'd have his own ways of dealing with this stuff.<br/><br/>Regardless, the above's just how those rules seem to me. Text is not the same as creator, so if that text is racist, then it is. Do you have any ideas for how you'd fix something like this, or is the entire topic just wrong-headed?

I mean, if you read books, watch movies, play video games, watch television, or consume any other kind of media, that's hard to avoid. Producing problematic content doesn't by itself make us bad people: it means we live in a society full of racism, sexism, etc. The fact that we enjoy and even regurgitate this stuff in our own creative works shouldn't be a surprise. But we can take responsibility for being aware of this and attempting to limit the potential harm that we cause, yeah? In my mind, that's where the moral responsibility comes in.</blockquote>\nI agree on the general shape of this thought, but am uncertain about the details of the application.<br/><br/>Actually, let me say a bit about how I view the genre of pulp fiction as audience and artist, it's relevant here:<br/><br/>Pulp fiction and many other genres and styles of culture are relics of our history. I appreciate them and enjoy them on their own terms. I enjoy Greek classics, I enjoy medieval poetry (Torqua Tasso is about 100 times as offensive as I'm at my worst, I should think), I enjoy basically everything that humanity has created. I also think that it's important for us to understand our history. For this reason I don't get offended by say Alexandre Dumas and his royalistic, anti-democratic sensibilities; he's a writer of his times, and he provides me with an intriguing window into what it was like when royalism was still a respectable political ideology.<br/><br/>When we work with historical material like this, there is necessarily ironic distance because we are not the people these things were made for. We do not need to believe that Chinese are inscrutable or that colonial ventures were necessary in civilizing the world. What we do need to understand, though, are mindsets, philosophies and material conditions that made these ideas able to flourish. Without understanding the people there is no understanding the history. And this is why I think that the answer to the question of ideologically wrong-headed art is not to shut it out.<br/><br/>My D&amp;D campaign is ideologically atavistic in that it's set in times and conditions where justice is not possible except in a narrow cultural context. I think that this is fundamentally the case for all D&amp;D, it's simply not game about the world as it could be at its best. Few games are, and we understand why as game designers: we make games about imperfect worlds because those are the worlds where it is worthwhile to understand our characters. What would Dogs in the Vineyard look like if Vincent had done his utmost to make the Faith concordant with his highest moral ideas?<br/><br/>(I think it's interesting how strongly modern D&amp;D design disagrees with me here - the current D&amp;D is totally a game that tries to remove all cultural context and feeling of reality from the problems the player characters face, all so it can maximize the feeling of fantasy heroism. It's a world where nobody is ever ill-treated due to sex or race, and where the answers are always simple and at the tip of the sword.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375669/#Comment_375669" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T17:49:31+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  5:49PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>.

It's an abstraction! The characters ~(as opposed to the players) have no way to actually deal with, or discuss, or in any way engage with their XP totals.<br/><br/>It seems to me that by far the most likely and prevalent effect of these rules is that people simply won't play Chinese characters,, because the game directly incentivises you not to. A more directly racist game mechanic would be difficult to imagine. I guess you could apply penalties to their Intelligence directly? I'm just shaking my head here, I'm honestly stunned that you could have ever believed this is okay.\n<blockquote><br/>As for how the scenario treats European characters in the orient, it's just a peculiar scenario rules detail.

You're not grasping the core issue, which is that IN ACTUAL FACT, spending time in "the Orient" lining an "Oriental lifestyle" is not meaningfully inherently deleterious to one's health, and it is a racist narrative to present a world in which that is the case. If what's actually meant to be destroying people's health is that they acquire an opium habit, why doesn't the rule talk about THAT? Like: "if you character develops an opium habit, make a Constitution roll, on a failure they lose 1-3 Constitution"?\n<blockquote><br/>Regardless, the above's just how those rules seem to me.

I'd aim for a VERY clear separation between racism <b>by</b> characters and setting elements within the fiction, and the game system which itself should not take account of the race of the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375670/#Comment_375670" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T17:49:45+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  5:49PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan</cite>Ironic racism is still racism.</blockquote>\nWell, maybe.

It's intent is to be full of gravitas of a dominant race (which if you will look around, in a lot of areas being white is the dominant cultural narrative, or part of the larger post colonial narrative).  Reading it in a silly voice is an attempt to subvert that, a poorly thought out and cheap attempt to subvert it.<br/><br/>Ironic racism likes to think that it's attacking stereotypes, but what it does is reinforce them.  It takes that image and reproduces it, and holds it up and while you may think that it's ironic when you take a moment to critically look around you'll see that a vast sea of people are also holding up that exact same image as to what that stereotype represents.  What we see as ironic, is actually lacking in any critical though hoping that its existence is enough to prove its irony.<br/><br/>It isn't enough, and that privilege to ignore the fact that it doesn't work only adds fuel to the stereotype.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375681/#Comment_375681" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T18:15:33+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  6:15PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I think a couple things are being conflated here: (1) games that deal with problematic real-world issues and (2) games that (intentionally or not) promote problematic views of the world or specific groups of people. Dogs is a great example, as is Poison'd. They're both about problematic stuff! And they ask you to dig in and wrestle with it, making decisions about it. Actively engaging problematic material can be productive. The problematic part is often when you present problematic material but don't actually give players the ability to engage it or do anything about it. If a game allows us to wrestle with orientalism, expose it, figure out who's behind it, feel the power it has, even participate in it, etc. then AWESOME.

Both are harmful because one is taking something that is a part of the experience of a group and the other is the displaying that you've taken it from a group.  I'll use an example that I've a lot more experience with.  You have a sacred garb that belongs to a group of people, you popularize it and put it on display for other of a dominate culture to consume.  You've trivialized the object in both the taking and repackaging.<br/><br/>But even then my argument isn't completely valid, because it's taken in isolation.  It's like leaving someone on the ground bleeding while you discuss how that one punch you landed wasn't so bad.  Why are you so beaten up over it?<br/><br/>To your personal experience I'll add mine in a weird hall of mirrors: what happens when a peripheral culture massively adopts sacred items of clothings from a dominant culture, but without the sacred value that went with it ?<br/><br/>If anything I have no trouble per see with your example too: I do no see the sacred value of the garb diminished by its improper use by non-believers in itself. It's the mass diffusion which *may* be problematic. (though you raise a interesting point: the garb is sacred in no small part <i>because</i> it is not shared. <i>Because</i> it is considered a proprietary cultural artifact, so to say - but culture is shared, it can't and should never be proprietary. At least in my opinion).<br/><br/>I have more troubles with non-sacred cultural elements.

Dogs is a great example, as is Poison'd. They're both about problematic stuff! And they ask you to dig in and wrestle with it, making decisions about it. Actively engaging problematic material can be productive. The problematic part is often when you present problematic material but don't actually give players the ability to engage it or do anything about it. If a game allows us to wrestle with orientalism, expose it, figure out who's behind it, feel the power it has, even participate in it, etc. then AWESOME.

I myself find that a historical or quasi-historical setting works for me in D&amp;D better than a culturally sterile one because it's more inspiring, and the old school method thrives on a textured fiction that has all sorts of nuances you can spin into bigger things. It's easier to kick up stuff from scratch and answer unexpected player questions, too, when I can draw on my historical knowledge and guesstimate sensible enough facts about whether our fantasy-Brits have like a hundred seafaring vessels or 10 000 of them. Perhaps my not getting bothered by the travesties of ethnic depiction we run into is because I'm quite a bit more racist than I'd have expected.<br/><br/>(As for what history "was" like, I definitely agree - I write about this several times in the World of Near.

Actually I've written about this challenge before.  <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12422" rel="nofollow">Here's the thread.</a>  The key thing to take away from the thread was that I wanted to have a game in which the characters were somehow outsiders from "normal" society's strictures. This was a very common Victorian adventure element: Sherlock Holmes was a weirdo druggie, Professor Challenger was a kook, Phileas Fogg was a lunatic suspected bank robber, Raffles was a thief, and so on.  Even among heroes who were not outsiders, they were placed into situations where normal society was torn apart (War of the Worlds), distant (50,000 Leagues Under The Sea) or ineffectual (Les Miserables' Inspector Javert couldn't advance because he was incorruptible), or even quite overtly the problem. (The main villain of Sexton Blake stories was a corrupt Scotland Yard official.)<br/><br/>This was one way I felt that my fairly light-hearted game group could engage with a time frame and a set of literature that often had racist or misogynistic elements or themes - sometimes pretty central, too.  Their characters could defy those structures without erasing them.  It was a FATE based game - I required that one of the Aspects of the characters be "why don't/can't you turn your remarkable abilities to the support of the normal organizations or governments of the time".  The examples I gave were: "As a Muslim, they will never accept me here" and "'A female mathematician? Bosh, I say!'"  The characters that were made included a ridiculed spiritualist/medium, a foreign freethinker, a Bohemian theatrical type, and a female academic who had made powerful enemies in the Church. <br/><br/>So already before I even got to designing the opposition or other elements of the game and setting I was already setting up lines by which the player characters would be excluded from Victorian "civilization" with all its assumptions and lines and hierarchies.  <br/><br/>I share a birthday with Sax Rohmer, who always claimed (moronically) that he based the character Fu Manchu on real Chinese criminals he knew when he was a newspaper reporter in San Francisco in the last part of the 19th century.  Because I shared his birthday, I was interested in his books at a young age and devoured them urgently as a teenager.  I remember these books as the first time I understood that books could be racist (as opposed to just characters in books).  Yet they were often exciting and action-packed, and one reason that they have persisted when so many other racist anti-Chinese books of the era have faded into obscurity is the compelling nature of the central villain.  <br/><br/>Rohmer is completely in love with this villain, completely fascinated by him. In one novel he has a page-long purple prose description of the guy, elaborate and exact....and in the next novel he uses <i>the same description word for word</i>.  He wrote a "letter" to his creation by way of introduction to a collection at some point where he outright states that a world ruled by Fu Manchu would be pretty okay.  But the books (begun in Edwardian times but rooted obviously in long-standing prejudices) are very different from many of the Victorian novels I described above.  <br/><br/>In Rohmer's novels, the main "heroes" are Establishment men right to their core, and most importantly, they have almost no agency. They virtually never do <i>anything</i>.  Entire novels pass where they take no action whatsoever.  Things are done to them, near them, and around them, and they have many daring escapes and moonlight pursuits, but the only person in any of these novels that takes any action to get what they want is Fu Manchu himself (or sometimes his daughter).  He is already just a hairs-breadth from being the protagonist of the books by the time I even considered adapting him to my Victorian adventure game.  <br/><br/>I already knew I wanted to create adventures which would explicitly reverse the assumptions of Rohmer's novels and put the establishment hierarchy as irrelevant, blinkered and ineffectual to deal with the threats of the game world, as they are in Sherlock Holmes stories, for example, perhaps a bit moreso.  So reversing course on Fu Manchu himself was natural - as I say, he was almost already there.<br/><br/>More to come.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375689/#Comment_375689" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T18:32:08+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  6:32PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I mean, yes, my adventure here could be read by somebody as affirmation of their racist ideas about China. I can imagine that person. At the same time, though, I would find it ludicrous that anybody at our own table would consider my depiction of say Fu Manchu as anything but an intertextual reference to an old pulp fiction meme; not one player could mistake my extra-fictional cues and think that I'm doing it unironically. If we had to establish a pedagogical value to what happens when we play D&amp;D, I'd say that it's made our group more aware of the colonial history and mindset. The bulk of our campaign's ethnic material concerns goblins (a sami-like people oppressed by the dominant population), and the group is I think very keen on the D&amp;D presumptions about what you're supposed to do with goblins, and what their characters actually end up doing.<br/><br/>But, yes - I don't accept that I would so misjudge my friends and proteg\xe9s that I wouldn't know roughly how they think and feel about ironic racism in our own game. The more general media influence thing I can swallow, though: the printed word, say, is a much less controlled medium than the tabletop game, so perhaps ironic racism can end up merely affirming racist imagery in that context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375692/#Comment_375692" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T18:40:04+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  6:40PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>It's notable that characters get experience points in old school D&amp;D in extremely arbitrary ways: even without going into my own home game, the common practice recognizes ideas like quest experience ("The party gets 5000 xp if they escort the prisoners out alive.") and experience penalties for things like not roleplaying your character class or switching your alignment. My halving the experience points of ethnic minorities working for the HEIC in that scenario is just another clever little bit like this. As a designer I find the bold cut of that suggested treatment interesting: not because of the racist element, but because it treats player characters unevenly and invites the party to deal with that.</blockquote>\nThat doesn't wash. If your intention is to portray a racist setting through game mechanics, then you fucked it up in the text at least, and probably the rules.<br/><br/>In Moldvay D&amp;D, the party splits xp equally based on all treasure found. NPCs get half normal xp.<br/><br/>In the games that Blair of Planet Algol runs, characters get xp for the treasure they keep, so if they split it up differently, they get different amounts of xp.<br/><br/>I believe it's the old Dave Arneson rule that you get xp for gold that you spend.<br/><br/>XP for doing things is a common house rule, although the OSR seems pretty in love with xp=gold, so I dunno if it's exactly "common practice" but whatever. It's still xp for <i>doing things</i>, not <i>being something</i>.<br/><br/>All of these systems present different dilemmas for players to negotiate in play. Splitting xp based on what races PCs are doesn't do that.<br/><br/>Second, yeah sure the DM decides how players get xp. But it's the players who decide how their characters split up the treasure. The company by-law that says minority characters get half-treasure and half-xp is a setting decision, made by NPCs, that you have turned into a rule. You are asking another person (the DM) to behave in a discriminatory manner, out of character. if you want the DM to play racist NPCs, that's one thing, but saying that Chinese people get half as much xp as Europeans, when that is not an in-fiction thing (by your own admission) means you are asking people to be racist outside of the fiction.<br/><br/>This is not the same thing as using the orientalist lifestyle to depict Europeans in the Orient as fucking scumbags. These are old-school D&amp;D characters, I know what they are like. If I sit down down to play D&amp;D and you tell me I canNOT play a European who has already spent time in China and respects and understands Chinese culture, I am 100% okay with that. That said, I understand Simon's reservations on this point (he knows the genre), and I would take his opinions into account if I were writing this text.<br/><br/>In fact, if I were designing this setting, I would probably do something like this:<br/>The HEIC supplies information on treasure sources, and supplies some basic gear. They expect a record of treasure acquired and take a percentage. The rest is split between the principles. The HEIC hires only Europeans, and does not give information, equipment, or sanction to non-Europeans. Whether or not xp is split equally or based on how much treasure each character receives is up to the GM.<br/>I think that would get you the same kind of character dilemmas without asking people to act in a discriminatory manner outside of the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375693/#Comment_375693" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T18:40:48+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  6:40PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite><br/>Liam: very powerful viewpoint there, I can see how you might treat this like that. What do you think, is yours a common ethnic perspective, and is that how you approach roleplaying games generally? What I'm getting at is, do you think that it's problematic to ever do an exclusively European D&amp;D adventure, or is it just that you yourself don't like that kind of thing? I mean, it seems like sort of a shame to be unable to do scenarios about e.g. the Opium Wars from the viewpoint of the Europeans because that is exclusive towards people who are not European. I say this as a person interested in European history and identity, obviously. Going the other way is perhaps not as difficult, as I imagine that many people of dominant ethnicities don't have similar hang-ups: I myself, for example, don't think much about playing a character who is of a different race than myself, and I can totally understand why - I've never had to care about my race in the real world, so it's not like I'm going to see it as a huge step to play e.g. an oriental ethnicity in TSoY.<br/></blockquote>\nI would second Liam's thoughts that you're referencing here. As a minority roleplayer, I often feel that texts that treat non-Anglo cultures as "normal" are sending me a strong signal that I'm not welcome in the hobby. It's tough to go through a book and realize there is no one that reflects your viewpoint in the work.<br/><br/>I think it can be great to create a setting that offers players the chance to play a specific culture (I'm a big fan of Werewolf:The Forsaken for precisely that reason), but I also think it's important to engage in some cultural relativism in order to do so.

If your intention is to portray a racist setting through game mechanics, then you fucked it up in the text at least, and probably the rules.</blockquote>\nCould be, can't hit them all out of the park. What I tried for was simple, impactful and unique, a rule that would singularly cut to the meat of the matter and provoke thought on the part of the reader. The D&amp;D we play is risky, so it's a given that we will have occasional "wild" episodes that follow no regulation whatsoever. A trading company that is so racist that its racism cuts all the way into the game mechanics doesn't seem very strange in that context. Merely joining the operation makes you a henchman (that being the inspiration behind that detail) if you're the wrong kind of person.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>In fact, if I were designing this setting, I would probably do something like this:<br/>The HEIC supplies information on treasure sources, and supplies some basic gear. They expect a record of treasure acquired and take a percentage. The rest is split between the principles. The HEIC hires only Europeans, and does not give information, equipment, or sanction to non-Europeans. Whether or not xp is split equally or based on how much treasure each character receives is up to the GM.<br/>I think that would get you the same kind of character dilemmas without asking people to act in a discriminatory manner outside of the fiction.</blockquote>\nSure thing, I like it. The sentence about the xp splits and the GM is a bit redundant method-wise, though, as it's assumed. Nothing wrong about doing it that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375706/#Comment_375706" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T19:10:35+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:10PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Eero,<br/><br/>I think it's interesting to think about what is so enjoyable about the racist pulp fantasy that your module draws on for inspiration.

What about the representation of Asian culture in this module makes it enjoyable?</blockquote>\nTotally, this is a key question. I think I should be able to answer, as analytical as I am about art.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that my fascination with a counter-factual world like this is because the ideas they are built upon are instinctually compelling. They're simple ideas clothed in outmoded dress-up. By immersing in them we learn to recognize them, recognize the patterns and recognize the differences from our world. It's nearly the same reason I take in <i>anything</i>, I'm never (not even as a know-it-all-teenager) been so foolish as to think that I could pick out some absolutely more truthful thing out of the various truths that people have worked with. I'll read Marx and Ayn Rand, I'll read Hitler and his best ideologues, I'll read the Bible, I'll read the best that every ideology can put up for me - if one of them catches me and convinces me, then that's what'll happen; I won't shy away from that danger.<br/><br/>By bringing a degree of biased perspective to the table in my China adventure I bring the players closer to the viewpoints and world-view that was influential at a certain point in history. The real China is totally enabled to be there as well, we play a very multi-level game communication-wise; where and when the GM hits you with different degrees of stylized pulp vs. merciless real historical analysis vs. insane Bollywood musical scenes (yes, musical scenes - bard characters can even initiate them by force) is a feature of our D&amp;D play. Not having the mythical China of the orientalist thought as part of the mixture would feel poorer to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375708/#Comment_375708" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T19:16:39+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

I mean that, really - lots to think about here, and I wouldn't have realized the degree of suspicious politics my adventure has if this topic didn't come up.<br/><br/>We've been asked to wind down this topic of discussion (the other thread got sunk a while back as you've probably noticed), so I'd suggest that we let this go here; feel free to write up a closing statement if you think that something hasn't been articulated clearly enough here, and if anybody has further points specifically for me, I'd be happy to discuss things over whispers a bit. (This goes for my adventure, especially - if you read it and have comments, by all means; I'd be happy to discuss why I did things the way I did.) I personally think that we got a really good thread out of a touchy topic, much better than any I've seen in here at Story Games. I know that many of you must be shocked and disappointed by my degree of alleged racism, but that's life in a wide world - there's all sorts of people here, and we'll just have to get by the best we can.<br/><br/>I'd specifically like to point out Liam's contribution on the first page, I feel that it got to me about the issue of cultural appropriation. I'd never thought that my adventure's set-up would be more than a curiousity about a sad phase of world history for people more ethnically conflicted than I am. As people have remarked, a person who's part of the dominant culture of his environment doesn't even <i>have</i> a racial identity to worry about, so it's no wonder if a guy like me can be insensitive like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375710/#Comment_375710" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T19:22:43+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:22PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Eero, I enjoyed the thread too.

If we want to understand how Europeans saw the world in the colonial period, we need to be willing to look at what they saw. And what they saw was an intimidating alien world without familiar symbols or social mores, but with more than enough industrial and technical power to shake their self-confidence. Just showing the facts isn't going to get you to the emotional level of what Europe saw in China then.<br/><br/>I should say that the Chinese don't need to <i>be</i> the above, they just need to be depicted that way by the GM. I myself totally read my adventure text, for example, as saying that the GM should give the players an orientalist image because that's a good and colorful take on the topic, but of course he's going to run the essential nature of his setting the way he does: if his Chinese are essentially human, then what he might be showing to the players would just be a superficial impression coloured by their characters.<br/><br/>Also, about instinctually compelling images: what I mean is not just that I like racism. What I mean is, <i>everybody</i> likes racism. That's why it's an important idea to understand. If you don't see how racism appeals to people in certain types of historical situations, we can discuss that over some other medium.

How have you done that?  You have achieved a nirvana state.<br/><br/>The problem with a large part of this type of debate is that there's this desire to take things and isolate them, which isn't how they're affected at all.  You're affected by the general media that goes on around you all the time, you can't avoid it because as soon as you step outside, read something on the internet, do anything involved with anything you're being assaulted by media.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this means that you and your friends in your gaming circle are racist.  What I'm saying is that no matter how hard you think your this ironic racism isn't racism, it simply can't be because it's still reinforcing the stereotype that you believe you're subverting.  That's privilege, the privilege to ignore the fact that there's a pretty good chance that the ironic sign people hold up isn't going to reflect your personal experience.

Like, they kinda knew about the stereotype and the mustache, but didn't know anything else.<br/><br/>Basically when I was thinking about what Fu Manchu would be in my game there were certain problematic elements I identified and wanted to reverse or contextualize in a way that would make our experience of the character less problematic. Here's how I went about it:<br/><br/>Anti-Exoticization: As mentioned in the other thread, one of the very bad elements (there are so many bad elements I hesitate to call one the worst) of the Rohmer stories is that Fu Manchu is described and identified in terms that are almost alien in their exotic-ness. "Inhuman" is an adjective thrown around a lot in those stories.  Like, this isn't just the normal (but still objectionable) titillation associated with "wow, they really do things differently there", this is seeing the character as completely beyond humanity.  So I firmly determined that there should be no trait that Fu Manchu (or any other Chinese character working for him) has that a non-Chinese person doesn't also have. FATE is actually a pretty good match for this because it's stunt system (in the Dresden Files incarnation, which is what I was stripping down for the game) doesn't have really highly specific styles or traits, instead it has (for example) stunts that increase your damage with your fists, and that can be whatever you want it to be, from boxing to dumb luck to the blessing of some fist-oriented spirit to some form of martial art, you decide.  I drew up a quick list of Fu Manchu's abilities and traits (genius naturalist and scientist, mastermind of secret society, ultra-educated, Mr. Polite, racist, covert war with scheming offspring) and I made sure that there was some other NPC in the setting that wasn't Chinese that had that trait - and Fu Manchu would not come onscreen until I had established that.  He might be unique to the degree he had certain traits, and he might be unique in the combination of traits he had, but I wouldn't be saying <i>or even implying</i> that he was the way he was because of his racial origin.  Again, FATE's Aspects really help here.  Being a mastermind isn't an "Oriental" thing in this game, there's Professor Moriarty. Being a genius naturalist isn't an "Oriental" thing in this game, there's Jacques the apothecary who is secretly a nature-worshipper and is probably (quelle horreur!) a nudist.  "Martial arts" isn't an "Oriental" thing in this game, being "Mr. Polite" isn't an "Oriental" thing in this game, etc.<br/><br/>More Legitimization - In the Rohmer stories, Fu Manchu is portrayed weirdly ambivalently in terms of politics. This is an area where Rohmer's admiration for his creation often seems to win out over his natural loathing.  Fu Manchu opposes fascists and communists, for his own reasons, but he is an anti-imperialist from the very first novel.  His primary motivation in those early novels is something the modern reader (and the outsider player characters of my game) is really quite sympathetic to. So if I didn't want to make him a straight up good guy, I needed to give him provocations and rivals that would push him too far, and demonstrate that as tied up in his battles and scheming as he is, he is not a champion of the people.  It's not so much that he opposes fascism, it's that he opposes anyone else edging him out of his position as ruler of the world. This is more of a change I made in his resources and methods than in the character himself - being anti-imperialist nowadays is a straight up good thing! - but I gave him more followers who had legitimate beefs with governments, companies and factions, gave him associates who struggled to achieve similar short-term aims (the protection of Chinese immigrants or the advancement of the Chinese people) but who would battle him as his sinister plan was revealed, and so on.  Politics actually turned out to be a big deal in this game, so once we started going down that road, I was able to really put some characters in some dilemmas.  Again, here I'm changing the context of the character more than the character himself. Rohmer's novels take place in a world where anti-imperialism is garbage pushed by fascists, communists and other would-be world conquerors.  By changing it in my world to something that has legitimacy, I give the character more weight, and also make it seem like he's something that could really happen to a brilliant person who took things too far in what was originally a good cause.<br/><br/>Okay, at about this point I started thinking "christ, am I really doing myself a lot of favors by trying to fix up this terrible character, I know I love it, but maybe it's too far gone, there may be too much shit to shovel, ya know?" But I was also kind of excited by the challenge at this point, AND it was actually helping me work out the setting of the game more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375739/#Comment_375739" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T19:51:26+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  7:51PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wherps...thread to be closed?

The core question of Narrativism is something like: "Now what are you going to do about that?" And then we find out what kind of person a character is by how they engage with the issues present in the game. It's not just "play to find out what happens" but "play to find out who you are."<br/><br/>If you're playing something that's less Nar-focused, when racism or sexism or other issues appear in your game, it's not necessarily a viable option to really dig into them and explore them, because that may not say anything about your character or the world, the way that murdering random folks in D&amp;D may not really say anything about violence (even as it arguably reinforces a culture of violence in other ways).  If a D&amp;D PC decides to enslave a bunch of goblins, if the other characters start treating that PC as a horrible criminal who needs to be murdered or at least imprisoned, the game isn't really set up to deal with that. But if the same thing happened in a more Nar game -- even something like Apocalypse World -- it might actually be interesting to explore what you do when your companion turns into a bloody slaver, because those are the kinds of questions the game is about.<br/><br/>That's part of what I meant by setting up the game in a way that the problematic material can actually be addressed and isn't just color for another activity, like dungeon exploration. If morality and hard choices aren't really on the table, dealing with immoral behavior and problematic situations becomes more difficult and potentially dysfunctional, especially if different members of the group have different levels of comfort or sensitivity about certain issues (even stuff like violence).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375750/#Comment_375750" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T20:09:18+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 to this thread being one of the more civil threads about touchy issues that we've ever had on SG.

If your game features racism and there are no forces acting to problematize it (and this includes the likely spectrum of player action, based on the incentives in place), then you have made a game that perpetuates racism, not one that comments on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375758/#Comment_375758" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T20:16:01+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  8:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Thomas:</b> I'm on the same page with you, morally speaking, but I think it's important to recognize that players can comment on issues in RPGs (especially in more Nar stuff) in a number of seemingly contradictory ways.

I should clarify: when I talk about actively encouraging the problematisation of racism, I mean something like "game systems as a whole drive fictional action in such a way that the situations produced are likely to demonstrate facts which problematise straightforward racist narratives". It doesn't have to be characters actively choosing the correct moral choices. It's more about bearing out the full consequences of all action with as much truth and recognition of shared humanity as you can muster.

I don't fear or regret reactions from audience segments per se, so just because some unrelated people think that the material is inappropriate wouldn't be enough to sway my inspiration - it never should be, or no honest attempts would get made.<br/><br/>However, the notion that people who might otherwise enjoy my work would find it viscerally unpleasant because of technicalities concerns me. That is, I don't mind if people who don't like D&amp;D don't like it, or people who take offense on principle (nothing wrong with being principled about your offense, it's just that I only care about formal complaints on a formal level, and not as a practical matter). However, if somebody would have liked the core virtues of the work (likes D&amp;D, appreciates the framing and tools of challenge, appreciates the setting detail and color), but I messed it up by writing my meaning in a way that made them unnecessarily comfortable... that's a concern for me. A real one, as like I said early in the thread, I didn't really think about my audience here in international cultural terms at all. I just wrote what I myself would consider a well-written and relevant D&amp;D adventure.<br/><br/>The difficult question is obviously about the core values of the work, and about what exactly causes these cultural hangups. If a nuanced reading and well-considered research concludes that the fundaments of the work are incompatible with say non-western audiences, then I'm in a pickle with that - it's not that I wrote it badly or that it could have been written better, it's that the substance of the work is not universal to humanity. That, then, goes into some deep stuff: is art that is not universally relevant valuable? If it is, what do I need to care about its validity for non-western audiences, as long as it punches as hard as it may for its real audience? If the alternatives are for a work of art to be non-universal or non-existent, which is better and more responsible? Depends on your answers to some questions about communication, society, art and other such generalities. I'd lean towards the notion that even Europeans have a right to reflect on their past, even if the very topic would be uncomfortable for somebody else. Sort of like how I acknowledge a person's right to enjoy pornography without having to acknowledge enjoying it myself.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if my adventure would be essentially fine if I only wrote it in a slight different manner, that's a question of craft and a flaw in my skills. Something to be fixed, surely. But this is not easy either: for instance, you can't create a work by second-guessing yourself, so to achieve such universally appealing language I would have to either internalize a new taste or get an editor committed to both the purpose of the work and a more inclusive aesthetic. Both are difficult steps to take for an artist, for I like my own work: I find the style punchy and fun, and the meanings nuanced and multi-layered. I would not be satisfied as an artist if the only thing I could manage would be to dumb down my work. One might ask whether I'm full of myself in saying that I like my work too much to fix it, but I don't think that this is a matter of skill, but rather of work ethic: you craft until you're satisfied if you're a real artist, and your satisfaction may only be measured by your own taste against your own gauges of style. It's entirely possible that my work is objectively sucky, and I would still have the same problem of not knowing where to stop and what to do if I could not trust in my own taste as a measure. That's writing to order, and ultimately you end up just fulfilling a rote work order when you work like that.<br/><br/>Going through the above evaluations now, I'd say that I probably would have written (and certainly played) this adventure anyway, as I think that it has interesting and inspiring things going for it. After that I would look at the color elements really hard, trying to decide whether to transform everything into culturally neutral fantasy; based on this discussion, for example, I would know that for some people it's going to be really important whether the adventure depicts an encounter between Brits and Chinese or "Talkumerans" and "Hero'ese" peoples. This would be a really difficult choice, I don't even want to think about having to make it: putting on that make-up of inconsequential entertainment would, I think, make the substance of the adventure pretty much entirely comfortable for anybody who's comfortable with D&amp;D in the first place, but it would feel so shallow to myself as a creator, I don't know if I could be happy about publishing the work in that form. Very difficult to think about which way I'd go, it's entirely possible that I would decide to not publish at all because both options are unacceptable.<br/><br/>Actually, I'd probably see about asking some of these people who seem to have self-confidence and philosophical certainty about racism to edit the piece. Then I'd see whether I'd hate the outcome as much as I fear, and if I were positively surprised, I'd publish the edited version. Then I could tell anybody who asks that I'd used wiser heads than mine to ensure that my most poisonous ideas never made it to print <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376036/#Comment_376036" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-02T19:29:17+00:00" title="May  2, 2012  7:29PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's the question I can't help asking.

After all, it's hard to figure out whether a text is racist or not racist except in a specific personal context; one of my favorite arguments about racism, whether <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and its author Joseph Conrad were racist, features this problem rather prominently. In another topic we were talking about the word "articulate," which is normally a compliment, but which becomes racist when someone applies it to a Black American.<br/><br/>So the way I see it, the module relates to three different people with very different viewpoints: the <b>author himself;</b> the <b>Dungeon Master;</b> and the <b>players.</b><br/><br/><b>Relative to Eero,</b> the text doesn't seem particularly racist. We know Eero, we're assuming he's probably about as racist as the rest of us, he's told us that he's interested in the history of racism and orientalism and he's using this text to explore and deconstruct them, and he's trying to share that with others through the process of game design. Okay, cool so far.<br/><br/><b>Relative to the DM,</b> the text is \u2026 weird \u2026 but still not especially racist. Eero is actively telling the DM to employ this explicitly racist trope, that racist trope, etc., in order to represent a racist time period and Orientalist genre features to the players. We\u2019re still civilized so far: the DM is supposed to create adversity, racism is adversity, the text is explicit that racism is bad and so we\u2019re using it to provide adversity to the players.<br/><br/><b>Relative to the players</b> we now have problems. With no access to the module text, D&amp;D players just get to experience the module through the DM\u2019s speech and handouts. If I were a player sitting at this table for this module (and I would totally sign up for this kind of thing if I saw it running at a con), I get to hear the experience and money thing, the Oriental debauchery thing, and the overtly Orientalist description of the city, and I would probably think, \u201cwell damn, either this DM or this module is really weird and Orientalist in their/its description of a city in China,\u201d because I don\u2019t get to see the \u201cpunch line\u201d of the ironically racist joke, at least not while I\u2019m playing.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not particularly personally worried about Eero personally purveying racism. I have yet to see evidence that he\u2019s more racist than, say, me, even if his foray into deconstructing racism is a bit hard for me to follow. I\u2019m also not worried about the DM reading Eero\u2019s text and getting the wrong idea, since it\u2019s so transparent that Eero is trying to do \u2026 something \u2026 with racism and Orientalism. But were I not to know about any of that stuff because I was just a player in the game, I would indeed experience some bizarre treatment of race, place, and culture.<br/><br/>Thanks for posting all this stuff, guys. It\u2019s always hard to put your vulnerabilities on display. Eero, I hope you\u2019ll take these different viewpoints into account if you ever decide to revise the module.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan" title="SeleneTan"><img alt="SeleneTan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/264/nRW74G3J2K4XC.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SeleneTan">SeleneTan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376654/#Comment_376654" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T23:28:41+00:00" title="May  5, 2012 11:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2012 11:29PM by SeleneTan.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lula has a lot of good points.<br/><br/>At a con, depending on the description of the session, I might or might not decide to play it. If I did play, I would get really uncomfortable fast as the DM started in on the descriptions and special rules. I'd likely be the only Asian at the table, and become hyper-aware of that fact. I would probably end up so uncomfortable I'd make some excuse about not feeling well and leave the session early.<br/><br/>The thing is, writing ironic racism is risky. You and your circle of friends may all understand that it's meant ironically, but exposed to the wider world, a couple of things will happen. 1) A lot of people will take it at face value. 2) A lot of those people will <i>agree with the non-ironic reading</i>. 3) The people from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> will see you defending your work as irony, and realize they can say whatever racist crap they want and excuse themselves the same way when they're called on it.<br/><br/>I have to admit my first impulse was to take your excerpts at face value because some of my elementary-school classmates and their parents really thought that way. Maybe not quite to that extreme, but there was a definite undercurrent of xenophobia + superiority.<br/><br/>BTW, a nitpick:\n<blockquote>\u2022 Local knowledge: ...

By doing this he elicit reactions in the players that is reminiscent of the reactions of humans of the time, both Chinese and Europeans. It is working the field with conscious techniques, and a deeper goal for the game-play.<br/><br/>I do not see the problem you see, Lula, rather a consistent way of working a theme, with consequence.

For example, living an 'Oriental lifestyle' ravages the body and mind of the participant. That may have been how Europeans perceived it, but as Eero explains the actual effects were debauchery and drug abuse from living the life of a European in China, not living the life of a Chinese person. When all the game rules say is that it's an 'Oriental lifestyle' that causes this effect, it looks as if the European hypocrisy is replicated unthinkingly by the rules rather than being critically examined. The person reading or running the adventure might recognise and reflect on the irony, but I think it would be largely inaccessible to the players.<br/><br/>I'd say the same thing happens with Chinese characters getting less XP than non-Chinese characters (although I understand there are ways of getting around this in Eero's adventure). That's not holding up the mistakes of our European ancestors for closer examination so much as replicating them in the rules. And once the misconception is at the level of the rules, I think it's much harder to critically examine than it is when the misconception is simply held by NPCs (and PCs) in the setting.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I've been thinking about cultural appropriation in terms of my own writing. I'm ambivalent about it, but I did make some changes to the stuff that I wrote for Dungeon World based on the discussions here. That material had originally been written for D&amp;D by other people, and I'd converted it to DW without thinking at all about the terms that they'd used and whether they were appropriate.<br/><br/>For example, a basic 'Add +Wis to Hack &amp; Slash instead of +Str' had been named 'Whirling Dervish'. In retrospect, that's gratuitous and silly. They didn't whirl into battle! And why am I dragging a sect of Islam into a fantasy game? There's no 'Knight Hospitaller' or 'Freemason' move. So I changed it.<br/><br/>The Anchorite class that I converted had access to 'Chi spells'. I changed that to 'Sublime spells' and have no regrets, basically for the reasons I gave above for the Whirling Dervish.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not telling you about this because I think I've done something great or special or anything like that. But I wanted to let you all know that the discussion has had an effect on me, and has changed some things that I wrote, and that I appreciate hearing your thoughts on the issue - even if I'm not totally convinced by anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager

They do not.<br/><br/>As the players take part in the scenario, they will invariably reflect on its content, and their propensity to choose what for them, as modern humans, looks very much like racist motivated solutions. The game motivates them to think and act as in a racist milieu, and that gives the players the basis for their own reflections. There are no set morals to the scenario, but a lot of insights to be had from contemplating your experiences with it.<br/><br/>I find such scenarios both interesting and quintessentially ethical; they deals with the core of role-playing games; walking in the shoes of other human beings, gleaning understanding from the exercise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376700/#Comment_376700" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T06:38:42+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  6:38AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Going back to Eero's game, I was thinking that the reward mechanics are embedding the structure of privilege.

It is not the default option.<br/><br/>While I agree that it could be made much more explicit that players have a choice regarding this inequality and that the choice requires conscious effort, isn't it worthwhile to examine how it can mirror real life mechanisms of privilege and opportunism?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376703/#Comment_376703" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T06:44:30+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  6:44AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 6:44AM by Troels Ken.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I find such scenarios both interesting and quintessentially ethical; they deals with the core of role-playing games; walking in the shoes of other human beings, gleaning understanding from the exercise.</blockquote>\nWell, one player's interesting eye-opener is another player's fist in the gut.

It is not enough to cite a text, and say it is "appropriating". Self-evident discourse is not sufficient. I expect people to say more; how they appropriate, and what consequences said appropriation may have. None of the texts cited appropriate indian culture in any bad way. I will say that they use elements from indian culture in a creative and constructive way, to inspire good design. There is nothing bad in it.</blockquote>\nHow is Game Chef appropriating First Nations culture?  Wow, let me count the ways.<br/><br/>Let's <a href="http://parenthesispress.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/anansis-children-the-rules1.pdf" rel="nofollow">misrepresent the mythology</a> because it isn't important to anyone, right?  I mean you can take Anansi which apparently originates in Ghana.  Sure there might be a Spider figure in some First Nations figures, like the Lakotan Iktomi, but who cares about sticking to one tradition right?  One Indian is the same Indian regardless of where you go.  It's kind of like that area of Europe.  Finland, Sweden, Norway they're all exactly the same.  Bjork, Bjork, Bjork, immiright?<br/><br/>How about we move on to <a href="http://lgarczewski.wordpress.com/lies-of-passage/" rel="nofollow">another game</a> where right at the beginning they tell you, "Hey, pick up a fun cute indian name.  It's not like your own personal experience is ripe with media cliches and stereotypes go for it."  Sure I'm paraphrasing, but what was actually said was this:\n<blockquote>Iron Claw, Three-paws and Storm Catcher are all great names, as are Dances-with-Humans, Howls-Like-Crazy and Dusk.</blockquote>\nSee, no harm in that at all.  Except that, this isn't how people name themselves, or solely name themselves, but hey you've seen it in film so it's a-okay.  <br/><br/>Even better, that same game later on encourages you to:\n<blockquote>Finally, you may want to get some blankets, as well as feathers and other trinkets to <br/>wear. At the very least, you will need a staff or cane for the Old One to lean on.</blockquote>\nAnd we <a href="http://nativeappropriations.blogspot.ca/2012/04/johnny-depp-as-tonto-im-still-not.html" rel="nofollow">all</a> <a href="http://nativeappropriations.blogspot.ca/2010/04/but-why-cant-i-wear-hipster-headdress.html" rel="nofollow">know</a> that nothing says <a href="http://nativeappropriations.blogspot.ca/2011/10/halloween-costume-shopping-sampling-of.html" rel="nofollow">"indian"</a> like feathers.

I have seen no evidence to that effect, and have heard no arguments close to being convincing. None of the texts cited has any racism to them.</blockquote>\nWhy are you a judge of that?  Is it racist towards you?  Is someone taking you and plastering your culture as a stereotype and cliche?  No?  But you can judge that.  Interesting how you look at it like that.<br/><br/>However, let's not talk about Racism per say, let's talk about Privilege.  Isn't it great that this isn't about you, and really will never be about you.  That's privilege, it's the privilege from usually being included in a text, or a game.  Being the default rather than the exception, able to blend in rather than being singled out at something exotic.  Quick, let's go play European doesn't have the same kind of appeal as, "Quick, let's go play Injun!"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>THE PREMISE FOR ROLE-PLAYING GAMES<br/>As I see it, the term "appropriating" is troublesome. At least in the way it is used here. It is used in a way that is anathema to role-playing games. <br/><br/>Role-playing games is all about "walking in the shoes of another being", and that is only possible if we accept the fact that some understanding is required to do this, and indeed; may be gleaned from doing it; that when you play another being you actually unlock a deeper understanding of how that being act, talk, think and feel. The whole idea of role-playing games hinges on this premise.<br/><br/>Those of us a bit experienced in playing serious roles in rpgs, know this premise to be true; we do unlock a deeper understanding of other beings by playing them.</blockquote>\nThis argument is an old chestnut and one I'd like to call out.  <br/><br/>"My fun is more important than not hurting you."<br/><br/>Because when you're playing/making these types of games, have you done your research?  Have you sat down with First Nations people and talked to them about their experiences?  What goes on in their everyday life?  What books have you read?  Were they written by First Nations authors, or where they just written about First Nations people?  Where are you drawing your sources from?  Where is <i>your</i> documentation?<br/><br/>If you do all that stuff above you might be able to approximate the experience of someone else.  If you don't then what you're doing is just using the stereotypes that you've consumed through the media.  No matter how "good" you think you are at this, what you're doing is a private red face show but just surrounding yourself with people who are going to pat you on the back for your "quality" performance.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>REDUCING HUMANS TO BIGOTS<br/>The term "appropriating" has been used to hammer home that only indians can talk about indians here, or in game texts. All others doing that must be "bad" in some way, according to the ones propagating this view. This is a view of the world (and indians) that totally disregard the human capacity of understanding other humans, showing empathy and feeling sympathy. It disregard our capacity to understand how our actions may affect other human beings, and our capacity to predict and understand the actions of others.<br/><br/>I do not believe in such a reductionist view of humans. We are far better. Most humans are not bigots, but socially intelligent beings with strong ethics to guide them. We are fallible, but also conscientious and forgiving, and able to create joyful interaction with our fellow beings. That is at the core of being human.</blockquote>\nBut we are Bigots.  Every last one of us here has prejudices and preconceived ideas about things that will, in the end, trip us up.  I do, I'm not immune to this at all.  Hell the whole, "my right to have fun trumps your right not to get hurt" argument which is used whenever anyone of any caricatured grouped brings up the fact that this is a caricature is a straight forward, selfished, privileged response.  We are not noble creatures, but we can strive for it.  That's really the key thing, it's trying to be aware of what you're doing and how it is affecting people.<br/><br/>Also, that doesn't mean that someone can't sit down and do their research and talk and make a game that explores these kind of things.  I know after listening to Brenda Braithwaite Garo's Ted Talk I actually can't wait to see what she's doing with her Trail of Tears game.  She's not First Nations but I've seen the respect and the ideas that she's put forward to talk about other tragedies in game for that I believe that she is coming at this from a great perspective.<br/><br/>Taking a week to make a game using another culture is probably the best way to not have your perspective.<br/><br/>So I have taken your reasons and find them in line with any other privilege person defending their privilege.  It's the same straw men, the same "But what about me! I'm different, right!" kind of argument that gets repeated time and time again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376706/#Comment_376706" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T08:21:03+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  8:21AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I believe you would experience a very interesting treatment of race, place and culture, and perhaps glean some understanding of your character in the process; she being a human of her time, and you being in her shoes.</blockquote>\nWhy are you so confident that you know better how Lula might react to this game than he does?

I didn't understand it then, and I definitely don't understand it now. If there were any truth to that argument, the people most active in campaigning for social justice would be the Ku Klux Klan. The number one argument put forward against people talking about racism is that we are wrong about its effects; this is even the argument we use on ourselves when we're internalizing it, because the effects of racism are insidious and complex. Why would it be more effective to ignore the effects and focus on the causes? Much less this scenario, where we ignore both the effects and the causes in favor of just pretending to be racist because the game tells us to be. I assure you that Dog Eat Dog is a serious game, and it expects you to play both sides of the coin -- how else are you going to understand the entire situation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376709/#Comment_376709" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T08:53:46+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  8:53AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (in the interest of public communication and all that, I'm currently discussing some problems in this thread, and moderating, with Tomas and others)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376727/#Comment_376727" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T10:36:52+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 10:36AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 10:37AM by Graham.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan and Liam,<br/><br/>Your behaviour on this thread is ignorant, insular and bigoted.

I say this as a person interested in European history and identity, obviously. Going the other way is perhaps not as difficult, as I imagine that many people of dominant ethnicities don't have similar hang-ups: I myself, for example, don't think much about playing a character who is of a different race than myself, and I can totally understand why - I've never had to care about my race in the real world, so it's not like I'm going to see it as a huge step to play e.g. an oriental ethnicity in TSoY.</blockquote>\nI can't really speak for other people, but I believe that other Asians, for example, might find that text similarly discomfiting. I do think it's a basic part of how I personally approach roleplaying games, though -- whenever I sit down to a game I want to make a character who's like me, and there's a good chance that means a person of color. I think nearly every D&amp;D character I've played has been more or less deliberately distanced from the traditional European fantasy tropes -- I've played a character based on Maui, a wuxia-style archer, a Middle Eastern assassin, etc. Obviously I don't want to overplay this stuff, because these aren't my personal cultures, and I want to avoid stereotypical or appropriationist behavior. They're just like any other D&amp;D character, they speak Common just like any other D&amp;D character, and they have the same classes as any other D&amp;D character, they just happen not to be European. It's just a preference of mine, and it makes me feel more comfortable and have more fun -- I don't tell other people to stop playing more traditional characters. (I mean, it's not like the experience of being the one PoC in a group of white people is a new one for me.)<br/><br/>I don't think it's impossible to write a game where everybody's assumed to be pretty much European that I would enjoy -- I love Dogs in the Vineyard, for instance, and that game definitely suggests that all the PCs are white as the sands of Deseret. (Although notably it doesn't actually mandate it, and I've played in games with Native Dogs before.) I think that if I walked up to the table, though, and you were like "gotta make a white dude," I would be like, "...why?" I'm potentially okay with doing it, but I immediately want to know why you'd need that rule -- what effect are you trying to get, and what's your goal? In Dogs, for example, the fact that their society is restrictive and moralistic is a key part of the game, and if the racist aspects of it are something you're interested in, the GM is more or less instructed to keep running you into that part of the society to see what you decide to do about it. In this particular case, again, I don't think I'd want to play. Doesn't mean we have to get out the scarlet letter for you, or that I wouldn't potentially be interested in a scenario about the Opium Wars.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Foo Dogs of the Heavenly Jade Temple</cite>\u2022 Native characters are allowed, and will have an advantage in cultural terms among the Chinese. However, a racist by-law is in force in the HEIC: if at least half of the PCs are of a single culture (usually western), then the members of all minorities will only be entitled to half shares of xp and treasure. The only exception are minority characters for whom successful Charisma checks are made to establish genuine friendship with the majority; each character may attempt this once per session for themselves or somebody else. (The party may override the HEIC by-law and institute their own after a single successful venture, although that's likely not pertinent in convention context.)<br/>\u2022 Demi-Human characters are allowed grudgingly, but the racist by-law applies to them as well. Additionally, Chinese will find demi-humans just as exotic as Europeans do; only play one if you enjoy being the focus of fascination with the exotic and fear of the unknown.<br/>\u2022 Local knowledge: For each European character the player is free to choose how many years the character has spent in the Orient. For each full three years make a Constitution check and an Intelligence check: failing the former indicates that the character has lost 1d3-1 in Wisdom and Constitution to the ravages of the oriental lifestyle; succeeding in the latter allows the character to possess a working knowledge of one language or similar topic of local knowledge; tripling up on a single language indicates near-native proficiency. Cantonese is a good idea, that being the local dialect.</blockquote>\nThese rules weird me out a little bit, for reasons that other people have mostly posted. For the first one, in my head XP is totally out of character. However on rereading it there's actually a very interesting thing going on here -- if there's no majority bloc of at least 50% of the PCs, nobody gets a penalty at all, but if at least half the PCs are the same culture, everybody else is pressured to play the same culture. So you theoretically can make a very diverse party with no problems, but most everybody has to agree; if most players are like "well, I'm just gonna play a traditional European dude, it doesn't really matter, right," it forces the other players to conform or get penalized. That's...actually a beautifully designed mechanic, so good job. I love it.<br/>I already made a post about demihumans, so we can take that to another thread if you want -- could be interesting.<br/>The difficulty I have with the local knowledge rule is that it doesn't say "the lifestyle these characters are leading in this city," it says "the Oriental lifestyle." Definitely an implication that that's just how Asian people live all the time. It's a small point, though, and the rule doesn't affect characters who actually are native to the city. I dunno. Another thing where I'd want to ask, what is the goal, is there a way we can express it in a way that doesn't make me feel a little alienated?<br/><br/>Hope this is interesting to you. I also want to quickly say that I really appreciate some people's posts in this thread but didn't get a chance to note them: Jonathan, Jim, JDCorley, Mark, to name a few. And Lula of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376753/#Comment_376753" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T11:57:59+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 11:57AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 12:01PM by Andy.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: #FF66CC;">Already delivered a few private requests, but please make future call-outs or calls/answers in whisper, email, yabumi, etc.</span><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376767/#Comment_376767" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T12:26:12+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 12:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 12:26PM by Lula.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Irony is not very constructive in most game-play. We are mostly required to take our characters seriously, and should do; it gives us the chance to walk in their shoes.</blockquote>\nI guess? I haven\u2019t really done a categorical analysis on the effects of irony on gameplay across games, but I will keep this exhortation in mind next time I play XXXXtreme STREET luge, or Drowning and Falling, or Maid. At any rate, I was just talking about a situation that didn\u2019t have much irony, not suggesting we need irony to fix it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Lula</cite>\u2026 were I not to know about any of that stuff because I was just a player in the game, I would indeed experience some bizarre treatment of race, place, and culture.</blockquote>I believe you would experience a very interesting treatment of race, place and culture, and perhaps glean some understanding of your character in the process; she being a human of her time, and you being in her shoes.<br/>Thanks for updating me on the nature of my experience. I\u2019ll be sure to consult you next time I have an experience, to make sure it\u2019s correct.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I do not see the problem you see, Lula, rather a consistent way of working a theme, with consequence. I see constructive possibilities for the players; they are in the game to walk in the shoes of their characters; and so they will.</blockquote>\nI don\u2019t contest that the game is any of those nice things you mentioned, but it is also racist. I would rather play a module which is all of those nice things you mentioned, as well as not racist. I think that creating such a module is well within Eero\u2019s powers if he chooses to do so, not that I\u2019m requiring him to do it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>To bereave them of the realism inspired by the time-period, would be a problem. It could lead the players to believe that their forefathers were plain stupid, or willfully evil, being so racist in their actions. Our European ancestors were not stupid nor evil; they were the prejudiced children of their time, acting in accordance with their beliefs. To reach any realistic understanding of them; who they were and why they acted as they did, we need to accept that fact.</blockquote>\nSo do I have to play a racist European to get mileage out of this game? I\u2019m a little confused now.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>In this game, by the tools given by Eero, the players will probably be helped into a deeper understanding of how our European ancestors thought, and why they acted as they did. And they will feel the repercussions in their own mind; making the same choices as their forefathers, and seeing the evil consequences, will make the strange shoes hurt. It will hurt due to the fact that the players are still themselves, while playing their characters, a kind of audience to their own actions in the game. Thus they will get a first hand experience of how blind and gruesome racism can be, fromt he viewpoint of the racist. That is great, and the way to go for all role-playing games of serious intent.</blockquote>\nSo I\u2019m going to add a category to my earlier discussion of the module relative to Eero, to the DM, and to the players, to wit:<br/><br/><b>Relative to Tomas</b> this module is not racist, and will result in a deeper understanding of racism, Orientalism, and Tomas\u2019s European ancestors.<br/><br/>But I\u2019m not talking about you, Tomas.

It's actually a really neat thing that games can do\u2014model power structures in society and make them easier to critique.<br/><br/>But the powers of privilege in society work best when they are invisible. So if you want to critique them, you need to bring them out into the open. When the players run up against them, they need to be explicitly stated and described. JD's comment on being transparent to the players is crucial in more ways that his personal foibles\u2014because when these rules aren't made explicit, even if some people recognize their irony they still function as part of the racism that they are trying to critique. They penetrate the game and make their racist content read as normal in this intimate, constructed space, hiding their own artificial nature. They may also make some players feel unwelcome.<br/><br/>I think that the single most effective way to improve on these pieces is to make an explicit statement, right there in the same sentence. This carries the extra bonus for an OSR audience that a hacker DM will have more tools available for changing them, because she'll understand why the rules are the way they are. Instead of saying merely that mixed parties can suffer an XP penalty, and leaving it for the DM and players to figure out why that would be, it should say: "Because XP in part represents a character's reputation, hence their ability to gain followers, tell the players that behaving in that their racist society doesn't accept will give them a penalty, unless certain steps are taken."<br/><br/>Instead of incentivizing a non-diverse party, tell the players that the system's racism is an obstacle that they can get around by gaming the rules, incentivizing anti-racism.<br/><br/>I don't know if it would be enough to make the text entirely palatable to me but it would help. Plus, I'd be empowered to say: "in my game, that's not how XP works, so we'll just toss that whole section."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376788/#Comment_376788" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T13:33:37+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  1:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>I am embarrassed to share a nationality with you.</blockquote>\nIt's mutual.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_376802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376802/#Comment_376802" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T15:14:11+00:00" title="May  6, 2012  3:14PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 3:34PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: pigeon</cite>This is not the first time I have heard this statement -- that the only real way to understand racism is to play a racist.</blockquote>You construe me to say something I do not say. Playing a racist in a role-playing game is one viable way of learning about racism, obvsiously. Playing a victim of racism is another way.<br/>Sorry about that -- you said "all roleplaying games," so I thought you were implying that the other option wasn't appropriate or effective. I obviously misread you -- apologies.<br/>I do accept your apology. It makes you a man to listen to, in my book.<br/><br/>I see how you could read it like that. I did not mean to say that you have to play a racist to understand racism; that would be a preposterous thing to say, for me. What I meant to say is that all role-playing games should aim for players to walk in the shoes of the characters. To me, that is what Eero is aiming at, with a variety of tools, in his scenario; he wants the players to walk in the shoes of people of that time-period; in particular the Europeans of that period. <br/><br/>Similar tools may be used to good effect in a scenario about victims to racism.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lula</cite><b>Relative to Tomas</b>this module is not racist, and will result in a deeper understanding of racism, Orientalism, and Tomas\u2019s European ancestors.</blockquote>Sarcasm is such a nice toy to play with.

That will ensure that your ethical system is up and running while playing the game. There is no way a conscious you can play a game like this, walking in the shoes of a racist, and not seriously reflect on how that character contrast your etichs.<br/><br/>I know of no art where artists are expected to communicate anything of substance to a drunken and/or comatose audience.

I tried so hard to understand the module by reading it and reading Eero\u2019s descriptions and listening and trying \u2026 but I was still wrong. I lack the intelligence and perception to determine the subtleties and actual nature of the scenario.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not joking or snarking or sarcastic here. I\u2019m dead serious. <b>I am not smart enough for this level of discourse and subtlety.</b> If Tomas hadn\u2019t pointed my failure out to me, I wouldn\u2019t have realized how wrong I was.<br/><br/>And it\u2019s more than just this scenario, since I realize that my (wrong) reading of the module stems from my own past experiences. If my experiences led me to a conclusion which I have determined, via Tomas\u2019s guidance, is wrong, then by the laws of induction I can only conclude that the experiences which pointed towards that conclusion must also be wrong. We\u2019re talking about innumerable games, innumerable texts, innumerable personal experiences\u2014I realize now that I\u2019m not competent to judge their ethical content, let alone the ethical content of any experiences I have going forward, with no correct experiences on which to base them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Lula</cite>I\u2019m talking about me at a con, sleep-deprived and drunk and hungry, significantly more inherently racist than you, and not nearly smart enough to think during a game of all the mitigating factors you\u2019re bringing up.</blockquote>Being drunk and sleep-deprived, I advice that you, and any others similarly impaired, would be better off sleeping, or playing some silly game that will have you giggle all night long.<br/><br/>Leave the more challenging games to the day you are awake and sober. That will ensure that your ethical system is up and running while playing the game. There is no way a conscious you can play a game like this, walking in the shoes of a racist, and not seriously reflect on how that character contrast your etichs.<br/><br/>I know of no art where artists are expected to communicate anything of substance to a drunken and/or comatose audience. Why on earth should this be the case for role-playing games?<br/>Oh my God. All those conventions \u2026 all those games \u2026 my ethical system must have been nonfunctional during all of those. Tomas \u2026 everyone I\u2019ve played with \u2026 everyone I\u2019ve GMed for \u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. I just didn\u2019t realize how wrong it would be to play serious games at sub-peak condition. I mean, I read this whole thread while I was awake and rested and sober, but I still ended up thinking wrong. Imagine how much worse I must have been at PAX and Dexcon and Dreamation and Recess.<br/><br/>I can\u2019t keep on going forward like this. I need someone to help me see the truth, someone educated and intelligent who can tell me what I should think, and what\u2019s right and wrong\u2014someone free of the wrong experiences which exist only in my flawed mind.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Lula</cite>Thanks for updating me on the nature of my experience. I\u2019ll be sure to consult you next time I have an experience, to make sure it\u2019s correct.</blockquote>You<i>speculated</i>on how you would react to actually playing the scenario in question, Lula. So did I.<br/><br/>I base this on the presumption that you have not actually experienced this particular scenario. Is that right?<br/>You\u2019re right. My only experience of this scenario has been reading it and having the author explain its nature to me. I know you\u2019ve played it, so you must be right.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>If that is right, then ...<br/>- you base your speculation on knowledge of yourself and your gaming habits, and how you react to the presentation of the scenario here.<br/>- I base my speculation on decades of experience with opinionated players, coming to my challenging games with fixed views, and leaving them as changed players. Not all, but most of them come back for more \u2026<br/><br/>Any one of us could be right in this particular case.</blockquote>\nNo I couldn\u2019t! You\u2019re right! You can\u2019t leave me like this now that you\u2019ve shown me what\u2019s true! I haven\u2019t had your decades of experience.

The lecture is about consumerism and environmental aesthetics but I think the links to gaming aesthetics and identity politics are pretty clear and direct. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nQgQjqG8KQ8" rel="nofollow">It's also done as a lecture series on Youtube.</a><br/><br/>If you are interested in discussing it, please use my email or find me on Google+.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16433/taking-this-cultural-appropriation-thing-on-the-road/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16433/taking-this-cultural-appropriation-thing-on-the-road">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16433/taking-this-cultural-appropriation-thing-on-the-road/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16433/taking-this-cultural-appropriation-thing-on-the-road/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16433%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16433%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
