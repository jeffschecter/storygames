Scars may only be healed by buying them off.  Each Scar will have its own buyoff condition stated in terms of a goal.<br/><br/>For instance, here's what a Scar would look like on the character sheet:<br/><br/>Scar: Convince Clive to forgive you<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>Scar: Send a message to Jasper on behalf of Paul<br/><br/>These would be placed on the player by the rest of the table, decided as a group.  So you take damage and receive a Scar, Tom, Jeff, and I are going to openly converse about what the buyoff should be, you can of course provide your own input but have no final decision power.  If we can't decide unanimously we'll vote as it shouldn't be a lengthy process.<br/><br/>Would this seriously miff you, if the group placed a forced buyoff condition on your character?

The primary concern is you can only have so many Scars before you hit rock bottom.  What happens when you exceed your upper limit is your character will leave the story perhaps through death, perhaps through physically leaving.<br/><br/>Also, I'm flirting with the idea of making the number of Scars you possess determine how potent you are in Social Conflict.  I imagine the opposite of a death spiral where you become more potent the closer you get to oblivion - hence if you buyoff a great deal of your Scars you'll actually be less able to get what you want.  This should cause a cycle of get into combat and take some damage -&gt; buyoff Scars/accomplish other goals -&gt; Fight recklessly again -&gt; and so on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221498/#Comment_221498" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T16:24:01+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  4:24PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I would be wary of my fellow players giving me buyoff conditions that screw up my character concept, such as "Forgive and make up with my stepfather" when I'm playing Hamlet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221499/#Comment_221499" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T16:47:25+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  4:47PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like, in games like these, you'd have to be open to having your character concept not only reinterpreted but basically driven by the other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221500/#Comment_221500" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T17:13:26+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  5:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's wrong with having a Scar?

Maybe not all the time.  But I bet it would happen.  So, it's no an issue of principle for me -- it's a matter of risking a deflation of fun.<br/><br/><br/>I have a question: <br/><br/>Why do it this way?  (That's not a rhetorical question.  I'd love to hear what you're going for.  I don't know how all your pieces fit together.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>I have some comments:<br/><br/>Some great conceptual innovations have come down the RPG turnpike the last nine years.<br/><br/>The greatest might be, in my view, the notion that we want to jigger the fiction so that the Players get to play fiction with their characters that they -- the Players -- are actually interested in.  (One common (but not universal) default used to be: "This is the story, so your character is interested in it, because your character is interested in it, so play a character who interested in the story whether your are or aren't, because being a "good" player is the ability to do exactly that.")<br/><br/>These days the mechanics of games allow the Players lay down Issues on their character sheets to tell the GM the things they want in a game; Players author the inciting incidents that kick off play; Players create Beliefs, Attributes and so on -- that inform all the adventure to come.  The beauty of this is that the GM doesn't have "lure" the Players into an adventure or subplots that might not interest the Player -- they're genuinely, already interested.<br/><br/>Would it be possible for the Player to create his or her scar, with input and kibitzing from the other players?<br/><br/>Again, I don't know what you're going for or how the pieces of your game fit together.  You might have the coolest thing going in the world.  But if my fellow players give me something they genuinely think is the coolest thing since Selma Heyak, and it really does nothing for me... then I'm stuck with this thing that doesn't interest me that the rules force me to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221505/#Comment_221505" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T17:47:54+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  5:47PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 5:48PM by misuba.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>I really think it would work for my group, but would it work for yours?

What I envision Scars doing is informing play and allowing the group to flag what they think is interesting concerning the given character.  Part of this concept of having someone else come up with direction for your character was inspired by Black Cadillacs character creation in which the character is built by multiple participants before returning to the player.  This appeals to me because it leads to challenging and unpredictable play.  <br/><br/>Would it be possible for the Player to create his or her scar?  Certainly, and perhaps I could be persuaded to go that route.  I'll have to toss that around in my head and perhaps try out both methods.<br/><br/>As far as being stuck with something you're not interested in?  Certainly that is a possibility and I would hope the ease of buying off Scars would minimize risk.  My experience concerning this sort of thing with my group is that even the dudds aren't all that bad and can be worked with - sometimes turning out to be much better than you originally expected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221508/#Comment_221508" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T17:52:48+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  5:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think in some cases I would miss the feeling of spontaneity that I get when, having suffered some kind of setback earlier in a session, I suddenly see an opportunity to turn it around in my favor; having the group say "okay, this is what you need to do to buy off the damage you just received" means that now I'm driven towards doing exactly that thing, and maybe even <i>only</i> that thing.  If getting Clive's forgiveness is the course that's been set for me, then I have less freedom to decide that, no, I fucking HATE Clive and I don't want or need his forgiveness...in fact, I'm going to make things worse with him and destroy his life to make myself feel better.<br/><br/>But like Christopher Kubasik says above, it's not really a matter of principle for me, it's just an "I doubt I would be 100% happy with this in every situation" thing.  I suppose that could be mitigated by keeping the buyoffs relatively generic/flexible ("Resolve things with Clive" rather than "Get Clive's forgiveness"), or by periodically renegotiating the buyoffs ("I know we said I need to get Clive's forgiveness, but the way he treats Juliet just pisses me off -- how about we change the buyoff to 'Ruin Clive utterly' instead?  That's much more interesting to me.").<br/><br/>Of course, at that point it may no longer be worth putting into mechanics in the first place.

Which is basically the same kind of deal as your Scars, since it happens as the result of conflicts.  However, in that design, you get rewarded for playing out the changed traits.  That's in my mind a somewhat better solution, because as Vincent would say, it aligns the interests of the players.<br/><br/>In your case, think about Scars as Keys (from The Shadow of Yesterday).  What if<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">, instead of having to work off a penalty,</span> they get a bonus whenever they address or ultimately resolve the Scar?<br/><br/>Say you're the golden boy, head of the Kingsguard, one of the best swordsmen in all of Westeros.  Then, a mercenary decides to cut off your swordhand.  What would be more fun to play out for you as the player, having a big-ass penalty until you retrain yourself, or getting rewarded every time you play out how hindered you are, how your ego is more hurt than your body, and how you have to reshape your identity? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Edit: Oops, I misremembered the death spiral.  Opposite effectiveness is good, but I still think a key-like effect could add to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221522/#Comment_221522" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T19:14:14+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  7:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>If Scars only do bad things, and if other people can give them to you as a way of satisfying their own agendas which are contrary to yours, you've got a problem.<br/><br/>If giving people Scars doesn't get you anything that the Scar-receiver doesn't like, then you should be ok.</blockquote>\nYou wouldn't be giving people Scars to satisfy your own agenda, at least not exactly.  NPC's never get Scars.  PC's get Scars but they are decided by the group.  The game would not naturally feature much inter-PC conflict (although perhaps occassionally) and the group would be on the same "side".  Thus, Scars really only provide a momentary Kicker of sorts (As Timothy pointed out).  It's really the group saying "We want this to happen next."  Think less GM prep more spontaneous group collaboration.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>What's wrong with having a Scar? Is there some sort of mechanical penalty?<br/><br/>What is if I want to<i>keep</i>a Scar?<br/><br/>I think it would be cool if Scars were some sort of Kicker-type mechanic, like if it didn't carry a mechanical penalty, but had some sort of narrative power. That way, as a player, I could keep the Scar for as long as I felt it was interesting, and I could buy it off when I felt that story thread had run its course.</blockquote>\nThere's no mechanical penalty beyond the possibility of an imposed limit as I mentioned earlier.  I don't imagine the limit would be hard to manage as one or more Scars should always be in reach and accomplishable.  <br/><br/>I also mentioned earlier (this thread is moving quickly so I can understand why you may have missed it) that I'm contemplating using the total number of Scars collected on a PC as a stat which would be used in Social Conflict.  Thus they are kickers with Mechanical meat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221572/#Comment_221572" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T03:45:01+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  3:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes I'm a narrativistic masochist. Sometimes I love to be forced. Sometimes when the game tells me "your character is going to do this" I say "Oh no! What are you doing to my character, you evil system! This turns my concept on its ears!" and I secretly love it, because now I have to roll with that and make it make sense. If your game is that way and I know it from the start, I'm gonna love it.<br/><br/>Sometimes another player wants me to do something with my character that I'm not interested in, and I do it, and I try to make it awesome, because that player wants me to, and I want to make the game fun for that player. And then she will make the game more fun for me some other time. If your game does that, and that "other player" is actually the rest of the play group, I'm gonna love it.<br/><br/>Sometimes I encounter a rule that I don't like, but that's really easy to change. Then I change it and it's fun and good. I suspect your game will, in groups where this makes people uncomfortable, be drifted this way so that it requires the consent of the player. If people are assholes they can abuse the rule, but you can't and shouldn't try to assholeproof your game. Besides, the rest of the group has to agree, so the group will have to consist of pretty much all assholes, and then who cares?<br/><br/>Also, I agree that you will lose some things by doing this. As Accounting for Taste says, you might lose the spontaneity of finding a way to react. But then again, you gain the choosing of how someone else's character will react. So I don't see it as a net loss, just a different way of doing things that will do different things.<br/><br/>All in all, I say keep it. Though the ability to remove a scar through some other, very costly, way sounds awesome, too. I WON'T forgive Fernando. I CAN'T! But to avoid it, I have to sacrifice my Compassion. Then it's a bang, and everyone loves getting banged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221584/#Comment_221584" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T05:30:00+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  5:30AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles, take a look at <a href="http://simoncarryer.googlepages.com/home" rel="nofollow">On Mighty Thews</a> by Simon Walsh, it does something similar to what you are suggesting with your scars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
