One of the games, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8lFCcI_iuKuQAt1bTpBvgV3hm5t6IcsC4AqT0bmTaw/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CMjao9sF#" rel="nofollow">Stage Names</a> uses the number of followers you have for blog posts you make to determine what you can do later in the game. Sort of effectiveness by popularity. It effects the situation and characters available to you, since certain outcomes give you access to different "voices", the various characters from whose point of view you write about the events.<br/><br/>Several of the games use wikis either as the main vechicle, or as a way to record it: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XurJ0GBjftyA08GaN2Io2AzPKShhTf6aWBY7KVEqzgw/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CJXW3aoK" rel="nofollow">Sleepers</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KPEq-33tDtyOhJ194H9c6GWHVwKAtg_2N5P4CBE0eSA/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CPiNiLwF" rel="nofollow">Caravan</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-bq919aZEyd6rKaxjoIgHaL7QTPJjdQ9q2pqnQblYo/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CNCgtvQF" rel="nofollow">Champion of the Realm</a>, and   <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQ9Xe6xf-tkYDiHtx5vzcy0XgXvs4YzFZ075ASyk7co/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CLLjhuAK" rel="nofollow">Inner Worlds</a><br/><br/>Rich Roger's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_ODKAK3kClKAHRUVHRktRoIbivFKzlf5Y-4tCklifY/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CJfcv7wF" rel="nofollow">Plot IS Character</a> might be something you'd be interested in reading. It doesn't use forums, but it is all about character/situation/setting. He meant it as a tool for GMs to sharpen up characters that might be introduced into play. <br/><br/>Using a forum would be a neat way to get other people's input on your own solo play. I wonder if some narrative rp sites (ie Harry Potter and the like) function that way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312024/#Comment_312024" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-10T08:46:29+00:00" title="February 10, 2011  8:46AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll  have to check those out when I have a bit more time.<br/><br/>Did any of them use any sort of feedback or tracking? Maybe some sort of scoring for the game?<br/><br/>Like, I dunno: I score one point, cumulative, each time I use someone else's idea and incorporate it. I also must notify them and give them something like a fan-mail point for using it.<br/><br/>"Hey I used Emily's idea about the Witch being the secret lost sister of the King.

The general idea (not all in the text, which is unfinished) is that your popularity feeds back into your gameplay options. So, for example, more views give you more options in what you can post. I think one comment should be worth several visits, it's kind of a super visit: someone not only visited, but interacted. <br/><br/>That said, there's nothing about actually using what's in their comment in your play, though that might be emergent behavior. Since you want more visits (to get more voices, performances, etc.) using something from the comments in your post is probably a good idea, to help draw people back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
