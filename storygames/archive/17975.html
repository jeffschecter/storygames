You may also remove a condition or regain the use of a Secret, depending on the details of the scene. A refreshment scene is a good time to ask questions (in character) so the other player can show off aspects of his or her PC\u2014\u201cWhy did you choose this life?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat do you think of the Lady?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhy did you take this job?\u201d etc. Refreshment scenes can be flashbacks, too.</blockquote>\nI have trouble with this. Sometimes it's fine, particularly when players use a lul in the action to both refresh and hit/buy off a key at the same time. Vance deciding to directly confront Lady Blackbird about his affections towards her, right before the final big fight on the Hand of Sorrow, was a great scene. It had mechanical relevance, the players had fun working out changing character dynamics, and it was reasonably brief, framed in the context of the imperial soldiers bashing down the barricaded door as the two spoke.<br/><br/>Not all refresh scenes go that well. Scenes based purely off of exposition are always rough, for a number of reasons. Because refresh scenes are presented as a kind of character building diversion, they have a tendency to become "well, I guess I should make up some kind of completely unrelated story, so I can get my dice."  Sometimes that's enough, or said unrelated story is reincorporated into the plot later, but many times they turn out irreverent and generally unfulfilling.<br/><br/>Oh hey, why did I make a thread?<br/><br/>I'd like your insights! If I can't get LB's refresh rules to work more smoothly, I'm considering cribbing Mouse Gard's GM/Player turns, and hacking it to fit the rhythm and results the current LB rules seem intended for.<br/>I'm interested in hearing about other people's experience with refresh scenes, or similar mechanics or situations- scenes where the main purpose is to develop color, background, or character relationships, without a pressing conflict or threat.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406337/#Comment_406337" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T14:45:28+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  2:45PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe reading up on how TSoY / Solar System <a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/it/node/18#c3.6" rel="nofollow">handles refreshment</a> would be useful?<br/><br/>For instance, I myself use a dual criteria of creative responsibility in refreshment scenes: players have an opportunity for exposition in them, but the GM likewise has an opportunity to introduce new threats and plotlines. The existence of this dual function ensures that these scenes have utility wherever they happen to fall in the story: either players have exposition to do, or if they don't, then their characters are ready for new challenges. I've noticed before, just like you have, that having refreshment formally require exposition is unnatural; it's better if it is an option and opportunity, but not a requirement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406363/#Comment_406363" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T19:26:12+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  7:26PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was going to mention that, too.<br/><br/>The key element in the Solar System/TSoY rules is that the refreshment scene be specifically about the character <i>interacting with someone else</i>, which creates those opportunities for both exposition (or character development) and the evolution of new plot lines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406412/#Comment_406412" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T15:43:30+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  3:43PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2013 3:45PM by Rickard.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never liked the refreshment scenes or anything similar to those in LB, mostly because of the overjustification effect. If you give a reward for something, you will kill some of it's fun. And I don't see the point of getting mechanical rewards for fictional creation - shouldn't you get a fictional rewards for fictional creation?<br/><br/>Looking at <a href="http://blog.ihobo.com/2007/05/designing-rewar.html" rel="nofollow">different reward schemes</a>, I would suggest having each player regain 1d4 dice (ignore the four) at any scene where their characters attend. All attending characters receives the same amount and the GM can even use a pre-rolled list of results (ranging between 0-3). A scene normally ends when there's a jump in either space or time. At any time, even during a scene, the players may call upon an intermission with at least one other player. The scene's theme must be one of the following five below and also be about the other player's character.<br/><br/>- Shedding new light<br/>- Relation gone deeper<br/>- A common memory<br/>- A secret revealed<br/>- What happened to us?<br/><br/>I don't know how this would turn out, but I'm eager to try it. My intention was to make a rule where the players doesn't frame scenes because they would get a reward (they will get it anyway) but because they want to create a slowdown of everything that happens around them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406424/#Comment_406424" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T19:38:06+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  7:38PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a pretty big fan of Lady Blackbird, played with lots of different groups. I don't think a refresh scene has to have no conflict. I've never put that requirement on it when I run it, at least. <br/><br/>Flashbacks are one of my favorite refresh scenes. If someone's PC is low on Pool Dice, no matter what's happening, we can jump back in time and play with their history, learn a bit about them. How did Natasha hire Naomi? Let's flashback to that. The scene itself answers the question. Then we jump forward again into the current scene with full Pool and we proceed.<br/><br/>Or, I'll use a refresh scene as a beat within the action. The PCs are on the run from some imperials, they end up hiding in a room. If one of them is low on Pool Dice, I suggest (if they don't do it already) this is a good chance to refresh.<br/><br/>Yes, it might seem a little unnatural at first. But refresh scenes are where I find out why I care about these characters, these versions of them. It's where I'm often the most surprised by the differing takes on the principle characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406430/#Comment_406430" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T21:12:36+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  9:12PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2013 9:17PM by mease19.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Refresh scenes are kinda vague but I take that as an invitation to do variations on the theme.  Do quick conversations between different pairs of characters where they both get the refresh.  Have everyone ask a question to the one player who is refreshing to flesh out their backstory.  Do a flashback to when Natasha told Vance to hire Snargle and let everyone refresh.  Ask everyone about their favorite place to be bythemselves on The Owl and what makes it so special and then remove a condition from its character sheet.  Give anyone who wants a chance to do a 1 minute confessional, in character, for the chance to refresh.  It's all about surprising and delighting the players with something new and using different techniques to pull out different aspects of the fiction.  <br/><br/>Also, listen to Rich (orklord), he knows his way around the wild blue yonder...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406437/#Comment_406437" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-17T02:22:10+00:00" title="February 17, 2013  2:22AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Rich (orklord) has run LB more than anyone else.
