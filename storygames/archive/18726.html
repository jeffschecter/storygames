It\u2019s inspired by the big, bold, larger-than-life space-faring epics like Mass Effect, Firefly, Star Trek, and by games like Traveller, Masters of Orion, Starcraft (and a bit of Galaxy Trucker).<br/><br/><i>Mankind has spread across the galaxy, fracturing into a thousand different cultures and societies, yet is still bound together by the vast galactic web of debt and favor. Wealth, duty, loyalty, agreements and servitude drive the politics of the civilized worlds and fuel the wars that span the stars. Debt makes the galaxy go \u2018round. All the while, the myriad factions look to the ever expanding frontiers of inhabited space, seeking wealth, resources and prosperity among the unexplored systems beyond the next event horizon. <br/><br/>But the universe is full of harsh, deadly beauty. From asteroid fields of crystals discharging lightning, to incandescent radiation curtains. From the starry vacuum of space to the rainbow patterns of planetary acid clouds. From majestic, earth shaking behemoths to the delicate gossamer parasites. The galaxy can be a very dangerous place indeed; and only the brave, foolish or suicidal dare venture to uncharted worlds.</i><br/><br/>Uncharted Worlds is a game of exploration and inter-faction conflict. The players are the owners of an interstellar vessel, travelling from world to world with a handful of crewmen, exploring new and dangerous worlds, trying to pay off their debts while earning favor with the new factions they encounter.\n<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ky16XZasoPVUtZd3BHYTFPSXc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><b>Uncharted Worlds v0.81 available here</b></a></h3>\n<b>The Principles of Uncharted Worlds:</b><br/>- Embrace the deadly beauty of the galaxy<br/>- Each new planet is unique and full of interest<br/>- The ship is home, the crew is a dysfunctional family<br/>- Debt makes the galaxy go \u2018round<br/>- Everyone has someone pulling their strings<br/>- Paint in primary colors<br/><br/><b>Game Info</b><br/>- Powered by the core Apocalypse World rules<br/>- Build your own character archetype by combining Origin and Careers<br/>- Players design the factions that will populate the story<br/>- Design a starship as a group and pilot it to wherever the stars take you<br/><br/>I\u2019d appreciate any thoughts, questions, suggestions or criticisms.

It was a fascinating exercise which completely destroyed the Faction creation and the mechanics of Debt <i>*sob*</i>.<br/><br/>BUT! That\u2019s a good thing. We hit on those problems right away, and felt how they weren't as elegant as they could be. We spent a good ~3 hours taking things apart, referring back to the Principles, and spitballing a lot of good ideas (many of which were awesome but too math heavy or not the right fit for the *World design philosophy of Narrative First). I'd like to give a big shout-out to the playtest group, who are all too lazy to sign up to this site (seriously guys? <i>seriously</i>?)<br/><br/><b>Inter-character connections</b><br/>First thing is that character creation needed something to tie the team together. Originally, I had planned on the factions filling that role, giving players shared backgrounds/animosities. However, this ended up not working nearly as well as I hoped. Instead, the new plan is to leverage the Principle of \u201cThe Ship is Home, the Crew is a Dysfunctional Family\u201d, by having players choose a bond with the ship itself. "Why are you on this ship, anyway?". For example:<br/>\u2022\t____________ is the heart of the ship. The crew gets along better when they\u2019re around.<br/>\u2022\t____________ is the only one who knows how half the systems work.<br/>\u2022\t____________ is on the run. Their enemies are now our enemies, whether we like it or not.<br/>\u2022\t____________ was rescued at some point in the past, and they've stuck around ever since.<br/>\u2022\t____________ has nowhere else to go. They've since ingratiated themselves.<br/>\u2022\t____________ wants to learn. The enthusiasm is infectious\u2026 and often quite useful.<br/>\u2022\t____________ is acting as an observer and advisor on behalf of a specific faction.<br/>There are a LOT more, but the general idea is when you create your character, you also want to define your relationship with the ship by choosing one of those or coming up with your own. Which brings us to the next point.<br/><br/><b>The ship as a character</b><br/>In addition to being the home of the dysfunctional family, the ship also needs to be its own character. I wanted the idea that each ship is slowly shaped and retrofitted with pieces that make the crew more comfortable and productive. That\u2019s why each skill you choose when creating your character also gives you a piece you can add to the ship. The ship, in essence, is the sum of the players. Thus, the ship is a team-built character.<br/><br/>This also gives me an avenue to work on ship combat/actions. Since the ship is a character, it\u2019ll have its own Ship Moves which the player characters can use. Its stats, skills, armor, weapons, gadgets and such will all be built by the players collectively at character creation. Each of the ships stats and skills would be driven and controlled by a different player (which gives me ideas for PowerRangers/Volotron type game but let\u2019s not go there focus <i>focus</i>).<br/><br/><b><i>Next up:  Factions and Debt.</i></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420423/#Comment_420423" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T11:05:51+00:00" title="August 20, 2013 11:05AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"That\u2019s why each skill you choose when creating your character also gives you a piece you can add to the ship.

I swear, it was like watching one of those controlled demolitions in slow motion.<br/><br/>Originally, I had planned to have players invent 2 Factions and then \u201cpass them around the table\u201d so that people could fill in the details. While this did kinda work to create the factions themselves, it had quite a few big problems. First was that it didn't necessarily build a strong connection between the players and the faction. It was just a bunch of facts, and affected the players as much as I am affected by the KGB. Secondly, it was just too many factions to keep track of for the GM and players. Thirdly, that much off-the-bat definition ended up making the factions feel\u2026 muddy. Finally, it put too many restrictions on the GM. It was generally agreed that factions, as they are now, did not work. So back to the drawing board!<br/><br/>First thing\u2019s first, back to the Principles. For anyone wanting to make their own game, <i>I can\u2019t stress how important it is to write out your Principles</i>. It is an amazing tool that will keep you on the right path, providing inspiration and consistency. In my case, the Principles I want to build up are \u201cEveryone has someone pulling their strings\u201d and \u201cPaint in primary colors\u201d. We\u2019re playing with Space Opera, here. We want organisations and factions that are easy to grok. Bold, primary color type things, that fill their roles in the story with gusto. Star Trek\u2019s Klingons and Mass Effect\u2019s Krogan are honorable and barbaric, Firefly\u2019s Alliance and Farscape's Peacekeepers are despotic and civilized, etc. <br/><br/>I\u2019m toying with a Fiaso-eque faction generation, where each player names one faction on an index card, gives it a broad role in the galactic setting (space pirates, planetary government, system police, etc), and passes it to the player on their right. That player gives a one-liner about their character\u2019s defining moment, event or mission with that faction, and passes it to the right again. The third player gives a one-liner about how they were involved in that event in some way, either directly or indirectly. I'm hoping this will tie the characters to the faction and each other more clearly.<br/><br/><b><i>Up next: Debt</i></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gornul" title="Gornul"><img alt="Gornul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gornul">Gornul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420440/#Comment_420440" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T14:14:43+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  2:14PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I'm not lazy, I was waiting for account approval.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gornul" title="Gornul"><img alt="Gornul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gornul">Gornul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420443/#Comment_420443" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T14:24:53+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  2:24PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyway, I think the right answer on Faction creation may still be something pretty close to what you have now.  The problem right now is that Reputation is a scattershot combination of "fact about faction" and "relationship to faction".  So perhaps instead, you'd do a Column A/Column B approach, so you'd choose from a list (or create freely within the same concepts) of "Faction X is [characteristic]" and "I have [relationship] with Faction X," independent of one another, to create the WHOLE thing.<br/><br/>Actually as I think about it, they may not even need to be coupled that way at all, but it strikes me as a natural minor evolution of the existing idea.  I honestly like the underlying CONCEPT of having it be similar to DW's Bonds because it feels good and it's obviously not overly complicated.  I think I fear over-complicating this function particularly because the Factions, and the Debt the characters owe them, are a huge part of the game, so while you may want pretty of flexibility, you also want the Faction generation system to set the hooks deep.  Having the system be too complicated would create the same end result as the current prompts being too narrow: inadequate player buy-in to that relationship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420464/#Comment_420464" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-20T21:47:00+00:00" title="August 20, 2013  9:47PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are factions fronts? <br/><br/>Are ship moves sex moves? <br/><br/>Why or why not please.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420475/#Comment_420475" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-21T06:20:40+00:00" title="August 21, 2013  6:20AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are factions fronts? </blockquote>\nFactions aren't fronts, though they can be part of one. Honestly I haven't put much thought into fronts, per say; it's an aspect of Apocalypse World/Dungeon World I didn't really use all that much. Factions are just groups that serve as allies or antagonists for the PCs.\n<blockquote>Are ship moves sex moves? </blockquote>\nHah, oh dear, no. Ship Moves are things the crew can coax the ship to do during hazardous situations like dog-fights or dodging through debris fields or making dangerous landings. But I think I get what you're asking; the characters and npc crew are going to be cooped up on this ship together, there are bound to be changes in the way they interact over time. It's certainly something that would add an extra helping of dysfunction into "the ship is home, the crew is a dysfunctional family". I'm not sure if I want to codify it into an actual move, though, especially since I don't have any system of Hx or Bond.<br/><br/>Thanks for your questions, good food for thought!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420485/#Comment_420485" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-21T10:16:54+00:00" title="August 21, 2013 10:16AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really liking the collaboratively created character of The Ship.

It feels like the ship should have stats; it's an easy way to measure the effectiveness of the engines, weapons, sensors, etc. On the other hand, it's true that certain people will be better at performing certain tasks.<br/><br/>I feel the divide happens between "I will do this to/in the ship" and "I will get the ship to do this". In your example, jury-rigging the ship would likely be a Patch Up roll; it's the character doing something to the ship. On the other hand, if the character was using Transfer Power (an as-of-yet- non-existent Ship Move that gives a +1 to another ship system) from engineering, it would probably use the ship's 'Power' stat (or whatever Stat I come up with). Basically, no matter how good the engineer, if the ship's power systems aren't up to snuff, the Transfer Power might not work (all together now: "I canna duu et Captain! She canna take tha load!")<br/><br/>The advantage is that it allows everyone to pick a station and act, not be relegated to something because they're "the face" or "the strong one". The disadvantage is that this does remove a bit from the character's mechanical in-game strengths and weaknesses, but I would hope that narratively, players would gravitate towards stations that they feel their character would be good at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420525/#Comment_420525" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-21T17:54:55+00:00" title="August 21, 2013  5:54PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can a crewman use a forward point to improve a ship roll?

More than anything, I wanted Debt to feel like it was woven into the fabric of life in the galaxy. I wanted it to be practically inescapable, not something that can be ignored or circumvented, something that drives desperate decisions and causes tough situations, something that snares the players. I want to feel the strings (\u2018everyone has someone pulling their strings\u2019) of inter-faction politics. Debt should be an insidious antagonist in the story.<br/><br/>BUT! It has to be somewhat elegant in implementation. It has to not require a lot of book-keeping and mathematical gymnastics. And the way Debt is gained and lost must feel organic within the gameplay. So yeah, tall order.<br/><br/>For a long time I toyed with Favor and Debt being separate but inter-related. However, this led down a rabbit hole of dodgy math and weird edge cases that ended up being more complex to conceptualize than just counting coins. Which is a Bad Thing \u2122. So I\u2019ve returned to the idea that Debt and Favor are opposites; you can\u2019t gain one while you have the other. While you are indebted to a faction, any Favor you would gain is instead removed from your Debt. Conversely, any Debt you incur while you have Favor with a faction merely erodes that Favor.<br/><br/>So here\u2019s what I have for the new debt mechanics + the 3 primary debt/favor moves. I\u2019ll post the thought process that went into the design of each move tomorrow.<br/><br/><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Debt/Favor rules v2.0:</span></i><br/>Debt and Favor are mutually exclusive stats that range from 0 to 4. Every point of Favor gained with a faction reduces the Debt with that Faction by 1 first until, you have no more Debt with them. Every point of Debt gained with a faction reduces your Favor with that Faction by 1 first, until you have no more Favor with them.<br/><br/><b>ACQUISITION (+Favor)</b><br/>When you make a major acquisition of goods or services, choose a faction that could provide them to you or provide you with the resources to obtain them, and Roll+Favor. <br/>On a 6-, something blocks or interferes with the purchase, the GM will tell you what.<br/>On a 7-9, you get what you were looking for, but you\u2019ve overreached the limits of your favor, earning 1 Debt with the faction. <br/>On a 10+, you get what you were looking for, but there may be questions asked if the acquisition is suspicious, extravagant or odd.\n<h6><i>Examples of major acquisitions:<br/>- Supplying your ship with fuel, rations, power and maintenance.<br/>- Repairing the ship.<br/>- Replacing a component on the ship.<br/>- Major surgery.<br/>- Replacing, repairing and/or recharging all your gadgets.<br/>- Buying a 2-mod weapon or outfitting a squad with 1-mod weapons.<br/>- Buying a 3-mod Suit or outfitting a squad with 2-mod suits.<br/>- Buying several tons of domestic cargo for shipping.<br/>- Organizing a social/media/political event.<br/>- Throwing a massive party.<br/>- Hiring a new crewman to replace a previous crewman (gang, squad, lab techs, repair crew, followers, etc)</i></h6>\n<b>COLLECT REWARD (-Debt)</b><br/>When you perform an important service for a faction, Roll-Debt. <br/>On a 6-, you merely gain +1 Forward to your next Acquisition roll. <br/>On a 7-9, your reward is great enough to grant you 1 Favor with that faction. <br/>On a 10+, you can instead choose to gain 1 Favor with a different faction, as long as the two factions are not hostile to one another.<br/><br/><b>PAY THE PIPER (-Debt)</b><br/>Whenever you enter a civilized region of space, the GM will name 1-3 factions that have a presence in the area. Roll-Debt with each of those factions if you have at least 1 Debt with them. <br/>On a 10+, everything is fine; you can go about your business. <br/>On a 7-9, they may contact you with missions/requests/demands.<br/>On a 6-, they are demanding payment. Unless you immediately gain 1 Debt with another faction to placate them, they will interfere with you. How they interfere will be up to the GM, based on the type of faction they are and how big the Debt is. Placating them does not reduce your Debt with the faction, it merely gets them off your back temporarily.\n<h6><i>Examples of faction interference:<br/>- Political/social lockout<br/>- Docking/service delays<br/>- Administrative red tape/audits<br/>- Harassment<br/>- Detainment<br/>- Surveillance/spying<br/>- Vandalism<br/>- Defamation<br/>- Blackmail/extortion<br/>- Theft/piracy<br/>- Assault<br/>- Assassination</i></h6> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420537/#Comment_420537" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T01:05:12+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  1:05AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>The first two moves seem kind of inert; they're just a bunch of numbers going up and down.

There seem to be a lot of overlooked opportunities here.<br/></blockquote>\nValid concerns! I\u2019ll see if I can address them.<br/><br/>The idea here is that these are not 3 \u2018stand-alone\u2019 Moves, but rather three moving pieces of a larger system. As you correctly pointed out, Pay the Piper is the main way the Debt system complicates the fiction (though I would disagree that it\u2019s the only instance, more on that later). The other two Moves exist to feed this primary Move. The three are interrelated cogs in a larger machine; player choices and actions go in, consequences come out. <br/><br/><i>- Acquisition:</i> Acquisition is the primary way the players will <i>accumulate</i> Debt; Debt which will allow Pay the Piper to trigger more often and \u201chit harder\u201d. The 7-9 result of \u201cGain Debt\u201d is a long-game complication, rather than having an immediate impact. Also note that a 6- is possibly a narrative complication, not always a straight-out failure. That said, I admit I didn't write it all that well, and I\u2019ll certainly reword it to be more explicit. <br/><br/><i>- Collect Reward: </i>This one is the carrot to drive players along. By gaining Favor, they can erase their Debt (remember that Favor and Debt are mutually exclusive and cancel each other out). However, the more Debt you have, the less likely you are to get enough of a reward to erase your Debt. It\u2019s a Debt-Spiral (that a cynical part of me feels may be a little too close to reality, honestly). <br/><br/>Erasing Debt makes it easier to get better rewards in the future from Collect Reward, and it lessens or removes the danger of Pay the Piper. And if you perform services for factions to whom you are not indebted, the Favor you gain with them allows you to use the Acquisition move more effectively.<br/><br/>However, I do agree that the -6 needs to have a greater connection to the narrative, and that the reward for 10+ (considering how difficult it is to actually roll that when your range is +0 to -4) needs to have more choice involved. I feel that outright \u201callies/enemies\u201d is  bit too rigid for the system, but they need a bit more oomph.<br/><br/><i>- Pay the Piper:</i> This is where the \u201coutput\u201d is, where the Debt system creates complications and stories and antagonists. Note that on a 6-, the player has the option to incur Debt elsewhere to temporarily save them from the consequences, but this is just another Debt-Spiral.<br/><br/><br/>So here are the 3 updated Moves:<br/><br/><b>ACQUISITION (+Favor)</b><br/>When you make a major acquisition of goods or services, choose a faction that could provide them to you or provide you with the resources to obtain them, and Roll+Favor.<br/>On a 10+, you get what you were looking for, but there may be questions asked if the acquisition is suspicious, extravagant or odd.<br/> On a 7-9, you get what you were looking for, but you've overreached the limits of your favor, earning 1 Debt with the faction. <br/>On a 6-, something blocks or interferes with the purchase, which will have to be resolved before the acquisition can go through. The GM will present you with a difficult situation, hard bargain or greater cost.<br/><br/><b>COLLECT REWARD (-Debt)</b><br/>When you perform an important service for a faction, Roll-Debt. <br/>On a 6-, you have not yet done enough to earn favor with this faction. They grant you +1 forward on your next Acquisition roll, and will present you with a new opportunity, task or service.<br/>On a 7-9, your reward is great enough to grant you 1 Favor with that faction. <br/>On a 10+, choose 1 of the following:<br/>\u2022\tYou gain 2 Favor with this faction<br/>\u2022\tOne of your allies gains 1 Favor with this faction<br/>\u2022\tYou gain 1 Favor with another faction<br/>\u2022\tYou gain 1 Favor and may request a new mission for this faction<br/><br/><b>PAY THE PIPER (-Debt)</b><br/>Whenever you enter a civilized region of space, the GM will name 1-3 factions that have a presence in the area. Roll-Debt with each of those factions if you have at least 1 Debt with them. <br/>On a 10+, everything is fine; you can go about your business. <br/>On a 7-9, they may contact you with missions/requests/demands.<br/>On a 6-, they are demanding payment. Unless you immediately gain 1 Debt with another faction to placate them, they will interfere with you. How they interfere will be up to the GM, based on the type of faction they are and how big the Debt is. Placating them does not reduce your Debt with the faction, it merely gets them off your back temporarily.<br/><br/><br/>Hope that addresses some of your concerns! (That\u2019s not to say I might not scrap the whole design if it doesn't hold up in playtests, hehe.) I do admit parts of Acquisition and Collect Reward needed more love, and I thank you for bringing it to my attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420620/#Comment_420620" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T11:58:29+00:00" title="August 23, 2013 11:58AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Can a crewman use a forward point to improve a ship roll?

(Note: these are all still highly experimental)<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, Spaceships will have stats of their own. They are characters in their own rights.\n<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spaceship Stats</span></b><br/>- <b>Maneuver</b>. The ship\u2019s acceleration, maneuverability and thrust. Used to pursue targets, evade threats, escape pursuit, traverse hazards and take off/land in dangerous circumstances.<br/>- <b>Power</b>. The ship\u2019s reactor output, inter-system distribution and energy surplus. Used to redistribute power between systems and provide those systems with temporary bursts of excess power.<br/>- <b>Shields</b>. The ship\u2019s ability to defend itself from direct attacks. Used to absorb lasers, disperse explosions, deflect small debris and ward against a variety of environmental and anomalous hazards.<br/>- <b>Sensors</b>. The ship\u2019s senses, the range, accuracy and fidelity of detection. Used to scan targets, pick up signals, provide target locks, detect stealth, get readings and provide telemetry.<br/>- <b>Systems</b>. The ship\u2019s miscellaneous systems. This covers all secondary stations and abilities that the ship has, such as tractor beams, air locks, docking clamps, life support, etc.</p>\nThe ship has Ship Moves associated with its stats. When making the ship perform an action in a dangerous situation, the characters use the ship\u2019s stats and one of the Ship Moves and makes 1 choice out of the available options. Here\u2019s an example of the Pilot Move with a ship that only has basic Star Drive:\n<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot (+Maneuver (+0))</span></b><br/><b>When you pilot the ship in a challenging or dangerous situation</b>, Roll+Maneuver (+0). On a 10+ choose 1. On a 7-9, choose 1, but the GM will describe a cost (time, energy, damage, etc) or a complication.<br/>-\tTake off/Land<br/>-\tDock/Undock<br/>-\tEnter Atmosphere/Exit Atmosphere</p>\nHowever, systems can be installed on the ship will improve these moves in some way, giving more options to this move. Various Engineering, Defensive, Computer and Structural systems will alter the basic Ship Moves in a variety of ways (Note: Weapon Systems are a bit different, and are not covered here). Here are some example systems:\n<p><b>Combat Thrusters</b> \u2013 Defensive System<br/>The as long as the ship has at least 1 functioning Combat Thruster for every 5 modules, the ship\u2019s Pilot Move gains the following option: \u201cEvade an incoming attack\u201d<br/><br/><b>Improved Propulsion</b> \u2013 Engineering System<br/>The as long as the ship has at least 1 functioning Booster Engine for every 5 modules, the ship\u2019s Pilot Move gains the following option: \u201cIncrease/decrease distance from another ship\u201d.<br/><br/><b>Booster Engines</b> \u2013 Engineering System<br/>The as long as the ship has at least 1 functioning Stabilizer Drive for every 5 modules, the ship\u2019s Pilot Move gains the following option: \u201cPerform an extreme turn, climb, dive or other stunt\u201d<br/><br/><b>Stabilizer Drive</b> \u2013 Engineering System<br/>The as long as the ship has at least 1 functioning Stabilizer Drive for every 5 modules, the ship\u2019s Pilot Move gains the following option: \u201cHover/maintain position/maintain stability\u201d<br/><br/><b>Advanced Impulse Drive</b> \u2013 Engineering System (max 1)<br/>The ship gains +1 to its Maneuver Stat<br/><br/><b>Advanced Piloting Console</b> \u2013 Computer System (max 1)<br/>The ship gains +1 to its Maneuver Stat when using the Pilot Move from this console<br/><br/><b>Autopilot Program</b> \u2013 Computer System (max 1)<br/>The ship gains +1 to its Maneuver Stat, and can fly itself in non-challenging situations</p>\nThe Modules mentioned in a few of the above systems are large sections of the ship, which can each accept 5 systems. So players can put their engineering systems all in the same Module and have it be their Engineering Bay, that kind of thing. If a small-ish ship took up 7 of its available System slots to make it as maneuverable and fast as possible, its Pilot Move would look something like this:\n<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilot (+Maneuver (+3))</span></b><br/><b>When you pilot the ship in a challenging or dangerous situation</b>, Roll+Maneuver (+3). On a 10+ choose 1. On a 7-9, choose 1, but the GM will describe a cost (time, energy, damage, etc) or a complication.<br/>-\tTake off/Land<br/>-\tDock/Undock<br/>-\tEnter Atmosphere/Exit Atmosphere<br/>-\tEvade an incoming attack<br/>-\tIncrease/decrease distance from another ship<br/>-\tPerform an extreme turn, climb, dive or other stunt<br/>-\tHover/maintain position/maintain stability</p>\nAs the ship gets damaged, components are taken offline, reducing the effectiveness and abilities of ship\u2019s Pilot Move.<br/><br/>What do you guys think?

If it is just miscellany that most ships have (docking hatch, etc), how is one ship's better than another?</blockquote>\nSystems is shaping up to be the most "add-on" of the stats; there are going to be dozens of things it can do, such as Tractor Beams, Salvage Arms, Boarding Pods, Probes, etc. The stat itself is a bit of an abstraction; you only need to roll it during challenging situations, so it's a measure of how responsive and efficient the system is (otherwise in routine situations there's no need to roll). The strength of the tractor beam, the accuracy of the salvage arm against a volatile wreck, launching the probe or boarding pod to avoid it getting blow out of the stars, etc. <br/><br/>It's also the skill to use when trying to re-initialize the miscellaneous systems after they've been damaged: if your life-support goes out and an airlock is blown, you better hope your Systems have the resilience and performance to prevent massive, ship-wide decompression.\n<blockquote>Does only one player make rolls for piloting the ship?  Are rules coming for gunners during ship-to-ship combat, or did I overlook them?</blockquote>\nUsually yes, though the ship can be upgraded with additional consoles if someone in the party wants to be a co-pilot (or co-shieldsman, or co-systems-operator)<br/><br/>Gunner rules are currently nebulous; some of the person-to-person gunplay from the current playtest group has me re-designing a lot of shooty-related things (which is why 6.0 is a bit slow in arriving)\n<blockquote>The Debt portion of the game isn't particularly interesting to me.  Do you feel like it could be stripped out in play pretty seamlessly?</blockquote> Sure, if you want to run a setting with a global currency (cred-sticks, etc), then the whole Debt/Favor thing can be more or less ignored. You'd have to set prices for various purchases, but it shouldn't be harder than a D&amp;D game otherwise.\n<blockquote>Overall this looks really cool and I'm definitely looking forward to playtesting later editions.

The idea of wound slots and rolling for damage all felt very numerical, and lacked the breadth and variety. It also lacked an amount of realism, as all \u201chp-damage\u201d systems do.<br/><br/>On the NPC damage side, I toyed with a LOT of different mechanics, including damage charts and Moves for damage or extra choices in the Open Fire move (which is the standard Move for shooting at stuff). It just got more and more complex. So I went back to basics. I embraced the deadly nature of the galaxy, and I asked myself; what is the core mechanic of *World games.<br/><br/>This is the new Open Fire move:<br/><br/><b>OPEN FIRE</b><br/>When you fire at a target within your weapon's range, explain how you want to harm or affect them (within your weapon\u2019s capabilities), and Roll+Mettle.<br/>\u2022\tOn a 10+ they are driven back, pinned, hurt, maimed or outright killed, as you described. If they have protection or mitigating circumstances (cover, armor, etc) the GM will explain how the damage is reduced or lessened.<br/>\u2022\tOn a 7-9, you get a reduced result, an unintended side-effect, and/or an additional cost for the attack (the targets get to shoot you too, having to unload your whole clip to hit, other enemies get to act, you cause property damage, etc)<br/><br/>As for players, I saw <a href="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/63408904/Apocalypse%20harm.pdf" rel="nofollow">Paul_T\u2019s \u201charsher damage\u201d</a>, and what I liked about it is that it eschewed hit points and instead just added description after description, leaving it up to the narrative to decide the actual effect.<br/><br/><b>SUFFER HARM</b><br/>When you would take damage, the GM will tell you the severity (Minor, Major, Critical or Fatal). Roll+Armor.<br/><br/>\u2022\tOn a 6-, you suffer an injury of that severity and an injury of each lesser severity as well.<br/>\u2022\tOn a 7-9, you suffer an injury of that severity.<br/>\u2022\tOn a 10+, you manage to avoid or resist the majority of the damage, and only suffer an injury of a lesser severity (Minor deals no damage)<br/><br/>The rule of thumb is that unarmed attacks are Minor, melee weapons are Major, guns are Critical, and heavy weapons are Fatal.  Explosives have falloffs, so a player that\u2019s close to a bomb might take Critical or Fatal damage, while a player further away would take Major damage from the blast, and a third player down the hall would take Minor damage from the shockwave, flames or debris.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a lot looser and open to interpretation, but I feel it conveys the effects of combat better than \u201cyou lose 3 HP\u201d. (Obviously this means I have to revisit how armor and weapons work, as well as re-write a number of skills. Ah well.)<br/><br/>Thoughts?

I have a few thoughts to throw out, for what they're worth:<br/><br/>1) I like the Origin+Careers chargen, it has a bit of the Traveller feeling.  What I can't help noticing is that there aren't any downsides to any of the origins or careers that I can see, not even ones like Artificial which I expected would have an associated flaw.  I know "balance" is not a huge issue in Apocalypse-powered games, but in my experience with other games in the family, it's the disadvantages, problems and connections built into the playbooks that drive a lot of the early game and make the characters come to life.<br/><br/>2) It all feels a bit generic -- it's very good, but there are an awful lot of generic space opera games out there that all use the same stock science fiction tropes.  When I think of space-opera RPG's that stick out in my mind, they're games like Ashen Stars, Bulldogs! and the playtest version of Galactic that all gave a very specific setting and flavor.  These constraints then made it easier for me as GM to come up with ideas.  <br/><br/>3) I feel like the factions are described too granularly, and that's going to cause trouble while running the game.  In a particular game, a crazed Admiral of the Imperial Navy might be one influence, while Naval Intelligence is another, maybe working at cross-purposes.  Since the interactions of factions and debt look like they'll drive the game to large extent, this is really important to get right.  Having a list of suggested factions might, AW-style, help create an implied setting which groups can color in to suit themselves and avoid the paralysis of wide open choices. <br/><br/>4) Careers: It jumped right out at me that you don't really have any "soft" careers: no obvious career for somebody who wants to play the emotional, caring side of the crew, like Bones McCoy or Counselor Troi or Inara.  There's no obvious career for Lt Uhura, even!

Lots of interesting stuff there, let\u2019s see what I can address\n<blockquote>1) I like the Origin+Careers chargen, it has a bit of the Traveller feeling.  What I can't help noticing is that there aren't any downsides to any of the origins or careers that I can see, not even ones like Artificial which I expected would have an associated flaw.  I know "balance" is not a huge issue in Apocalypse-powered games, but in my experience with other games in the family, it's the disadvantages, problems and connections built into the playbooks that drive a lot of the early game and make the characters come to life. </blockquote>\nHmm, an intriguing concept. Both my RL group and online group tend to dislike disadvantages, and obviously I write for the people I know. It\u2019s certainly something I can look into, though, could be cool. However, having played both AW and DW, I feel like I may have missed the explicit, playbook-defined disadvantages/problems. Could I ask for an example?  Maybe I\u2019m just overlooking something obvious.\n<blockquote>2) It all feels a bit generic -- it's very good, but there are an awful lot of generic space opera games out there that all use the same stock science fiction tropes.  When I think of space-opera RPG's that stick out in my mind, they're games like Ashen Stars, Bulldogs! and the playtest version of Galactic that all gave a very specific setting and flavor.  These constraints then made it easier for me as GM to come up with ideas. </blockquote>\nSad but true. It\u2019s a product of the \u2018history\u2019 of the development. At first it was a Mass Effect hack, but then I discovered that someone with more clout/popularity was attempting the same thing hehe. It evolved into a Traveller hack (as evidenced by the character generation), and eventually evolved into a more generic frame. I certainly intend to apply a more well-defined/unique setting as things solidify, and the Factions and Debt is undoubtedly going to be the basis of it. I\u2019m open to suggestions!\n<blockquote>3) I feel like the factions are described too granularly, and that's going to cause trouble while running the game.  In a particular game, a crazed Admiral of the Imperial Navy might be one influence, while Naval Intelligence is another, maybe working at cross-purposes.  Since the interactions of factions and debt look like they'll drive the game to large extent, this is really important to get right.  Having a list of suggested factions might, AW-style, help create an implied setting which groups can color in to suit themselves and avoid the paralysis of wide open choices. </blockquote>\nFunnily enough, that\u2019s just what I was toying around with this morning! I have a new playtest soon which includes new faction creation rules. The new rules try to emphasize the \u201cPrimary Colors\u201d ideology of space-opera. I\u2019ll report back about that.\n<blockquote>4) Careers: It jumped right out at me that you don't really have any "soft" careers: no obvious career for somebody who wants to play the emotional, caring side of the crew, like Bones McCoy or Counselor Troi or Inara.  There's no obvious career for Lt Uhura, even!  There's also no career for the guy who wants to be the captain of the ship -- that's an important enough role in the source material I think you should consider making it a career of its own, or have rules for creating an NPC captain if no one's into it.</blockquote>\nAn interesting point. In my opinion, I\u2019d say that Inara is a Priviliged Starfarer Personality. That said, one of the strengths of the system that I\u2019m particularly happy with is the ease at which you can add a career path and exponentially increase the overall number of Archetypes. For example, while I personally wouldn\u2019t want psionics in the \u2018main setting\u2019, adding a \u201cPsion\u201d career path would allow everything from Military-Psions to Personality-Psions to Clandestine-Psions. The question is; what is the \u2018skillset\u2019 of this \u201csoft\u201d career? Is it a form of leadership and fellowship? Empathy and diplomacy, maybe? Perhaps a split between the \u201cstar/artist/entertainer\u201d of the Personality career, and a more diplomatic/empathic/verbal career. I\u2019ll certainly look into it, could provide some new options.<br/><br/> As for \u201ccaptain\u201d, I\u2019m very hesitant to actually push that one player be a superior of another. I\u2019ve had too many bad experiences with that; it pushes certain players into the background because they assume subservience, etc. In any event, I don't feel that captain needs a career path; a \u201cCaptain\u201d could be a Military Personality or a Scoundrel Starfarer; it all depends on the ship, crew, and tone of the game.\n<blockquote>5) Ship and Ship moves: another thing I noticed is that the careers that are more ship-oriented don't really buff the ship any more than the careers that go along with being a passenger.  It seems a little disappointing to create a Spacer character with Starfarer-Industrial careers and not get many more ship-related gimmicks than somebody who took the Clandestine career.  I also really liked Orlando's idea of ship moves being like sex moves, and it would be awesome for each character to get a certain move that they can do shipboard that nobody else can do, to represent those scenes of downtime while the ship is en route to its next destination.  </blockquote> Very true. Once ship rules are solidified and destruct-tested, I agree that a couple of careers could get ship-based skills. My fear is making skills that are very situational. If your skills are awesome in a ship and useless outside of one, it\u2019s much harder to make a scenario in which you\u2019ll want to go out and explore. And in ship-based situations, I\u2019d like everyone to be able to do something useful, not just the ones with a ton of ship-based skills stealing the spotlight. It\u2019ll be a fine line to walk, but I do agree that the Starfarer needs a ship-based move. <br/><br/>Awesome feedback, great food for thought.

While it did unify the team, it also lessened inter-party dynamics. With an individual Debt/Favor, players can be "I'll get the component from AstroMining, they owe me" or "Guys, I can't go against StarSword Navy, they're already breathing down my neck." In play, it ended up being a very nice dynamic, informing a lot of desperate decisions. Last playtest, I presented a simple choice between completing a delivery for their employer, or handing over the delivery to another faction that 3 of the players had Debt 3 with (3 out of 4, to be clear, so pretty damn high). They sold out their employer for a chance to alleviate some of their worst Debt.<br/><br/>For example, with individual Debt, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjgGWOpksEw" rel="nofollow">it certainly can create situations like this</a>.

For shared costs like refueling, repairs, upgrades, etc.  Otherwise, a specific character probably needs to take on Debt to pay for this stuff- but I can see how that would be a source of inter-party tension.  Along those lines, I think the 'ships share' of takings used to be a thing amongst privateers and the like, for maintenance.<br/><br/>If so, do you have a defined Captain role, where the ship is 'theirs' in some way (decision-making or ownership)?  Perhaps that's a tradeoff in the Captain book- it's your ship, but it's Debt is also yours.  Maybe they get to be accountable for the ships' Debt, in addition to their personal Debt.

We're in Better Tomorrow space. They'd flay me alive if they knew I was buying stuff from their affiliates before paying back what I owe them.")<br/><br/>I'm kinda wondering how to handle captaincy; I've had bad experiences in the past with having one player being higher up in a hierarchy than one or more other players. So far my base assumption is that the Crew are more or less equals (player crew, that is; the players could have subordinates that fill out the crew; mechanics, scientists, followers and such), and as such all have an equal say in the way the ship is handled. The idea is that the Ship's "Debt" is the sum of the problems caused by its Crew's debt. When a faction decides to impound the ship or take pot-shots at it, the ship is suffering for the Debt of someone onboard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422030/#Comment_422030" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-26T11:55:55+00:00" title="September 26, 2013 11:55AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of the genre as I see it is that the Captain doesn't have much actual sway over his crew he is a leader, not a commander. In Firefly Mal was the Captain, but most of the time the crew acted by consensus (or bickering). Sometimes Mal would DEMAND fall in line, but more often that not that would strain his relationship with the crew.<br/><br/>Maybe give the captain a special move: "Lay Down The Law" that he can use to "strongly encourage" people to get in line, but would come at a cost (Strings in Monsterhearts?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422081/#Comment_422081" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T07:36:00+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  7:36AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2013 7:37AM by Archangel3d.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. Good point, and gives me an idea: <br/><br/>Perhaps a Loyalty ranking, which ranks the other players from highest to lowest. So when a decision needs to be made, someone who's high-up on the Loyalty list can "pull rank", in a story sense (not mechanically). It's not a 100% "you have to do this" (because telling players what to do sucks) but it will at least guide their decisions. It makes someone a <i>de-facto</i> captain, rather than <i>de-jure</i>, by being at the top of other player's Loyalty lists. (Wash is not as loyal to Mal as he is to Zoe, but Zoe has Mal on the top of her Loyalty list, so Wash rarely disagrees with Mal if Zoe has a say.) Also, the "top" of a Loyalty list means little if the character is self-centered and/or treacherous (Jayne has Mal on the top of his Loyalty ("I didn't rat YOU out"), but that loyalty is as shallow as a puddle).<br/><br/>At the end of each session, each player can increase the Loyalty with one person and/or decrease it with another, allowing them to shuffle things around based on what happened in the session. If the person at the top of their Loyalty list led them astray or pulled rank on something stupid, then they just lost that respect. If someone low on the Loyalty list did something awesome for the character, then the Loyalty increases.<br/><br/>This works well with the Principles of "Everyone has someone pulling their strings" and "The ship is a home, the crew its dysfunctional family". Once the ship rules are in place, I'll give this a whirl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle" title="Paul_Riddle"><img alt="Paul_Riddle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">Paul_Riddle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422224/#Comment_422224" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T18:41:00+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  6:41PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, make a relationship map part of your game!

If you're trying to balance out control so that there's not just one person in charge who is above the rest, then you might draw from Strings (Monsterhearts) or debt/pecking order/coerce (Undying - inspired by MH). <br/><br/>The reason I suggest making R-maps part of your game is that it serves as a constant, visual reminder of the obligations between characters.

Choose 1 additional general trait for them.<br/><br/><b>Crew: Gang (Scoundrel Career)</b><br/>You have the loyalty of a handful of gang member NPCs. Give three of them names and short 2-4 word descriptions of their personalities. The gang members are armed with simple melee weapons and pistols, and can be Commanded to engage in destructive and/or criminal violence (assault, brawling, mugging, vandalism, etc). Choose 1 additional general trait for them.<br/><br/><b>Crew: Followers (Personality Career)</b><br/>You have the loyalty of a handful of NPCs. Give three of them names and short 2-4 word descriptions of their personalities. The followers come from a diverse background; choose 2 general trait for them.<br/><br/><i>The "Give three of them names and short 2-4 word descriptions of their personalities" is just for the start of the game, just to get things rolling and give the GM a starting point; the rest will be defined and named during play.</i><br/><br/><br/><b>General Traits:</b><br/>\u2022\tSidearms: The crew is equipped and trained with small firearms, and can be Commanded to engage in limited combat.<br/>\u2022\tMedical Training: The crew is trained in first aid and equipped with trauma packs, and can be Commanded to provide basic medical aid to multiple victims or assist in emergency procedures.<br/>\u2022\tSocial: The crew is socially adept. In situations appropriate to their personality and sophistication, they can be Commanded to interact and entertain a group of people over a period of time, improving dispositions.<br/>\u2022\tIntimidating: The crew is imposing in some way, you decide why. Most people tend to avoid interacting with them or angering them, and are distinctly uncomfortable in their presence.<br/>\u2022\tDisciplined: The crew is especially disciplined and dedicated. They don\u2019t question orders and quickly recover from the -1s of reduced disposition and effectiveness. They only take Commands from you.<br/>\u2022\tPolitical: Choose a faction. The crew has ties to the hierarchy/command structure of that faction. They can be Commanded to interact with that faction in your stead, granting +1 to any Rolls involving Debt or Favor with that faction.

Then, make rules that build on the relationships. Then, you have a crew and getting your way can have its cost.</blockquote>\nThis is a neat idea.  What would be really cool is if you could create a little diagram (or even drawing of a ship) that showed the relationship between the PC's, any major NPC's, and the gangs associated with the ship.  This could be Uncharted World's module that goes in place of Hx, Bonds, or Strings.  <br/><br/>Optionally, you could also use this to determine damage locations during ship combat -- instead of determining damage logically from the outside in, determine it based on affiliations and what's important.  That way, when Jim's character starts a fight that ends with the explosive decompression of my space boudoir, it feeds right back into the fiction instead of just being a negative modifier on a scanning roll or something.  If you want to be nasty, let the crews serve as ablative armor for the sections, so you can burn through redshirts in a thematically appropriate manner.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Lovely.<br/><br/><br/>I'm making a little module for one of my games that focuses on relationships. I'm not sure how useful this is as Undying has a rather lovely and intact system to inspect, but anywho: I'm playing with something kind of like Keys in Lady Blackbird by way of the Bonds Hx variant. I have a number of Bonds each of which is essentially of the form: I Owe ____ and am owed ___ so long as ____. I'm still fine-tuning and streamlining, but the ones I'm pretty sure will be part of the final list of "official" bonds (names aside as evidenced by my use of /'s) are Command/Service, Duty/Respect, Favor/Debt. The connection to Keys is not explicit, but essentially each Bond comes with something the target owes (command is obedience), something owed the target (command is leadership which involves taking responsibility, offering resources, giving directions), and those obligations play into moves and can be invoked both to hurt and help you in various circumstances so long as the relationship holds; the relationship can be "bought off" in a sense when the "so long as" condition is broken, absolving you of the obligations of the Bond by removing it or altering it (being discharged ends Command). At first, one think I liked about this is that you can plug beliefs and motives into the system just like people and factions and places and ships--I have a Duty to protect my homeland. But such things probably work better as a character tag/aspect type thing to avoid additional fiddliness. Save the complexity for big, important relationships!<br/><br/>When you make a Bond, there are some basic trappings that can be assumed but you can also write out a short contract that ends up reading kind of like a Key statement in Lady Blackbird which is why I mentioned that connection. Contracts make explicit what happens when a bond is broken if it is different form the default, or alters certain terms of the default bond slightly or simply makes them more explicit. I'm currently working on how to deal with conflicting bonds, how to handle bonds that break-out into other bonds (going rogue instead of being discharged can give the leader a Duty to Apprehend and can damage the reputation of the follower) without making the whole thing too messy to be worth it. I'm also toying with mechanizing it further by giving bonds "health" and changing how they work under strain ... but that seems like a fast track to "more fiddly than it's worth" except for really, really big relationships like your relationship with your political faction or with your core beliefs. Sort of like making custom moves for really important characters and places.<br/><br/>I want authority, reputation, and obligation to be mechanical and while I don't really have a solid system yet I figured I'd mention it in case it jogged anything since that's what's being talked about here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422695/#Comment_422695" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-10T11:13:54+00:00" title="October 10, 2013 11:13AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>fun house-rule idea: within each crew team (mercs, engineering, etc), have each player claim one character and flesh in out (back story etc).

It\u2019s tentative; I\u2019m writing it out cautiously in the hopes that I don\u2019t scare the idea away.<br/><br/>The problem is that I\u2019ve done away with a hitpoints system in the \u201cperson v person\u201d combat, opting instead for narratively appropriate injury descriptions. Players accrue injuries of Minor, Major, Critical or Fatal severity, depending on what they are hit with and how poorly they fail their Armor roll; death happens at narratively appropriate times, rather than when a number reaches 0. \n<blockquote><b>SUFFER HARM (+Armor)</b><br/>When you would suffer harm, the GM will tell you the severity (Minor, Major, Critical or Fatal). Roll+Armor.<br/>On a 6-, you suffer an injury of that severity and one or more additional effects (knockdown, drop weapon, damage armor, broken gear, etc), or you suffer an injury of a greater severity<br/>On a 7-9, you suffer an injury of that severity.<br/>On a 10-12, you manage to avoid or resist the majority of the damage, and only suffer an injury of a lesser severity (Minor deals no damage)<br/>On a 13+, you ignore all but the worst of the damage relatively unscathed. You suffer a greatly reduced injury. (Minor and major deals no damage, Critical deals Minor, Fatal deals Major)</blockquote>\nOn the other side of the coin, this is the rule for PCs hurting NPCs:\n<blockquote><b>OPEN FIRE (+Mettle)</b><br/>When you fire at a target within your weapon's range, explain how you want to harm or affect them within your weapon\u2019s capabilities, and Roll+Mettle.<br/>On a 10+ they are driven back, pinned, hurt, maimed, killed, etc, as you described. If they have protection or mitigating circumstances (cover, armor, etc) the GM will explain how the damage is reduced or lessened.<br/>On a 7-9, you get a reduced result, an unintended side-effect, and/or an additional cost for the attack (the targets get to shoot you too, having to unload your whole clip to hit, other enemies get to act, you cause property damage, etc)</blockquote>\n<br/>Again, narrative, not hitpoints.<br/><br/>Aaaaand because of that I feel like I\u2019ve written myself into a corner when it comes to ship combat. I want to maintain consistency, so that it\u2019s not jarring. On the player-suffering-damage side, it\u2019s not so bad; Shields replace Armor, and it\u2019s the ship and crew that suffer damage and injury. Pretty straightforward, and scales up well enough. There are some neat tricks to be had with using Transfer Power to the Shields and such, very space opera.<br/><br/>But when it comes to enemy ships, I fear that the Open Fire philosophy (\u201csay what you want to accomplish, on a 10+ it happens\u201d) won\u2019t cut it. Ships are multi-system affairs protected by layers of shields. A single missile or plasma cannon shot shouldn\u2019t be able to just wipe one out, even if the player describes it that way. I\u2019d like to inject a bit of Star Trek/Star Wars into a ship-to-ship encounter, narrative-\u201ctactical\u201d choices, rather than \u201cI blow them the eff up\u201d as the default decision.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, its FTL that gave me a bit of inspiration. I\u2019m toying with the idea that the Shields of an enemy ship are a separate \u2018entity\u2019 that has to be defeated before the ship itself can be hit by weaponry, and that an average enemy ship is composed of 2-4 parts that can be targeted individually to disable various capabilities (once the shields are down). A 7-9 on an attack against a ship could mean their shields are back up. So a fight against an enemy ship is really a cluster of 3-5 enemy 'entities', one of which protects the others.<br/><br/>What do you guys think? Any ideas for alternate solutions?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422946/#Comment_422946" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T21:10:37+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  9:10PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2013 9:33PM by Gwathdring.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I would do it as custom moves. Some ships are just metal NPCs. Some ships are just NPCs in a very large, dangerous suit of armor. Some ships are <i>places</i> or terrain. Some are really, really interesting and have special rules and features. My instinct would be to just treat some general ship classes as functioning in about the same way and have a few custom move templates I'd alter to taste based on the features of the ship--but most of the time I'd play it a little more by ear and just think about how the ship works. Does it have shields their weapons can't get through? Well ... that sounds like a custom move or something that requires inventive tactics on the part of the PCs. Does it have shields they just have to whittle down first? I'll just take that into account as they fire. Especially if I'm not using health or clocks!<br/><br/>They fire a missile at the ship ... what happens? Well now it's shields seem to be weakening. The pull of some science wizardry to precisely examine the shields? You tell them how to counteract the shields right now or exactly how many missiles will take shields down or what-have-you. They miss a relevant roll ... well, I might say "It's still heavily damaged, you've got it on the ropes, but it seems they've managed to get their shields back up at full strength while you were messing around in engineering."  Consider when you should zoom in and when you should zoom out. Sometimes, they say they want the ship to go over there and it goes over there. Sometimes you make them struggle with the steering or the flight computers. Sometimes they attack like the ship is their weapon. Sometimes they have to struggle to get the ship to do what they want.<br/><br/>If you really want enemy ships to be codified in a particular way consistently ... well, I need to know more about your setting. What allows you to target specific subsystems of a ship? Your available weapons? Your ingenuity? Your aim? Is it different for every sub-system? Maybe ships have Modules. Each module has some move-modifiers associated with it or something. <br/><br/>I don't know ... if you really want to inject some real ship-to-ship tactics into the mix, I think narrative options are going to work better unless you create an elaborate rule-set. Ask what you want ship-to-ship combat to be like. Do you want players controlling themselves on-board their ship, or controlling the ship as their avatar? Is the ship effectively a character or is it effectively a series of tools, weapons, fictional bonueses, mechanical bonuses and custom moves disguised as a single object for conceptual and narrative convenience. I guess if you really want to codify it in detail and stay true to *world ... well at that point I'd suggest having separate basic moves for space ships. The ships are NPCs that in turn contain NPCs.  When you're in your space ship, the ship has it's own set of moves and it's own stats. You can do things on board that affect how the ship functions, but the ship is almost like it's own character. Pull a FATE-Fractal, *World style.<br/><br/>And if none of those sound attractive, I'd suggest your basic moves don't work. If you don't want a whole new set of moves just for ships (maybe even a smaller set?), and you don't want to just treat ships with the same casualness AW uses for vehicles--just an extension of the PCs that maybe gives them a stat burst, a custom move, minor move modifiers, extra armor, or what-have-you--then you need to change your moves to make sure they <i>do</i> work whether you're at the ship level or not.<br/><br/>Ask yourself what the play experience should be like. Because there are quite a few ways to achieve the narrative experience of Star Wars or Star Trek. Again, are players focused on the exact status of all of the enemy subsystems? Are players focused on the status of their own subsystems? Are players focused more broadly on whats happening? Are players focused on the ship's positioning and momentum?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422947/#Comment_422947" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T21:30:17+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  9:30PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2013 9:32PM by Archangel3d.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> I guess if you really want to codify it well and stay true to *world ... well at that point I'd almost suggest having separate basic moves for space ships, instead.

The Ship (as a character built collectively by the players) has 5 Stats; Power, Shields, Sensors, Maneuver and Systems (Systems is a bit of a catch-all for airlocks and tractor beams and such). Combat was my last big thing, and I wanted that to be based off the character's Mettle, rather than a ship stat (though I'm sure there will be an upgrade that allows a weapon to be fired by the ship's Sensors roll, auto-target or something)<br/><br/>That said, perhaps a custom Move is in order. Might even tie it to the type of weapon you're firing (point defense has different options than a torpedo launcher)<br/><br/>Your point about needless codification, and about the variety of ships. I feel I may need to sleep on it, but ultimately I think you may be right; I may need to simplify, and accept the Zen of *World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422948/#Comment_422948" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-15T21:38:02+00:00" title="October 15, 2013  9:38PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, I appear to have ninja-edited.

I do feel that UW will probably have a base setting; I'm currently playing with a setting of wormholes + self contained, culturally unique sectors, with "wild-space" outside that is reached by blind jumps (semi- random exit point) rather than wormholes (fixed entry and exit). <br/><br/>That said, playing the game as a trade-game <i>a la </i>Suns of Gold would be imminently do-able. The big issue would be refactoring it to account for the Debt/Favor mechanic rather than whatever wealth system is present in SWN (again, I had fully intended to look into it and then didn't because I suck and am forgetful).<br/><br/>Speaking of; I've run a couple of playtests but I would like to run an intense study of how well Debt/Favor works in practice. It's one of the most ambitious changes from traditional rpgs in Uncharted Worlds, and I want to make sure it holds up.<br/><br/>On that note, if anyone is interested in trying out a playtest of UW over G+ Hangout, send me a PM with what days and times you'd be available and I'll try to organize something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czevak" title="czevak"><img alt="czevak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czevak">czevak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423306/#Comment_423306" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-22T23:49:09+00:00" title="October 22, 2013 11:49PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2013 12:00AM by czevak.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As always with SWN supplements, Suns of Gold comes with a ton of tools / tables / examples to help the GM to create adventures<br/>(see for instance, the review here <a href="http://andyslack.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/review-suns-of-gold/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://andyslack.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/review-suns-of-gold/</a>). <br/>There are already rules for factions in the core rules of SWN which are expanded for traders in this supplement as this is an important aspect of commercial transactions.<br/>(SWN has a quite complete free edition <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423944/#Comment_423944" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T19:28:15+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  7:28PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huzzah, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ky16XZasoPWm5WMHI0aGVMdDA/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><b>version 0.6.2</b></a> is uploaded!<br/><br/>Pretty major additions in this version, including Vehicle creation, Heavy Weapons and a completely overhauled and streamlined Debt system!<br/><br/>That basically covers all the mechanics for the game!

(Actual quotes between the Broker and Mercenary: <i>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell the presence of physicists unless you observe them\u201d \u201cBut we can tell you how fast they\u2019re going\u201d</i>). They deliver the physicists to their peers in Project Jotun. One of them is a Thyraphysicist (litt. \u2018student of the nature of doorways\u2019), a Wormhole Physicist, but her experiments collapsing/redirecting wormholes had to be cancelled; the expansionist empire on the other side of the wormhole had sent a fleet through into the sector. The session ended with the party and the various science vessels of the Jotun Project scattering away from the in-bound fleet, heading for other wormholes out of this system.<br/><br/>There were a lot of neat moments and creativity. I had a lot of fun, and I\u2019m really interested to see where the story will go. For a party made up of mostly bruisers and/or rogues, the team\u2019s solutions were surprisingly non-violent and mostly above-board. (I blame the Broker's smooth talking and cleverness).<br/><br/>The new Debt/Favor worked surprisingly well; it greased decisions without being a straitjacket. I'm going to have to run a few consecutive sessions to get a feel as to the long-term impact of Debt, but so far so good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429684/#Comment_429684" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T17:47:06+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  5:47PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2014 8:30AM by Archangel3d.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Goodness it's been a long while since I last posted here. I've been heads-down rewriting a lot of the rules and playtesting like mad; got a LOT of great feedback from playtesters both in real space and over Google+. Some of the core philosophies of the game have been greatly improved (in my totally biased opinion), and I'll write about them in detail below. I feel very confident in the solidity of the current design, barring some revisions with the ship systems/rules that have lagged behind the rest of the changes. I think it's about time for me to consider moving into the Verbosity Phase, where I write a whole lot about the whys and whats of the rules, rather than the more spartan 'I know what I meant when I wrote that' current layout.<br/><br/>There's a big scary thing looming, though; Kickstarting. Getting an artist, and a copy editor, and the publishing and distribution. I cannot express how much that terrifies me, hah.\n<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ky16XZasoPODl5VDJqRGU5Tjg/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><b>Uncharted Worlds v0.75 available here</b></a></h3>\nAaaanyway. For those of you who may have tried out an older version, there have been 2 big changes:<br/><br/>- 'Pulled out' narrative combat. For single attacks, the catch-all Move 'Face Adversity' still applies. However, in situations involving enemy forces to overcome, which would invovle a real battle/firefight, the players are encouraged to use Open Fire and Launch Assault. These are what I call 'pulled out' combat. The granularity of roll - damage - roll - damage is replaced by a single roll. The player describes what they want to accomplish and the tactics they will employ, and then roll. They and the GM are then free to describe the series of events in that combat much more freely, as long as they inevitably end with the result proscribed by the dice. This has allowed a LOT more cool action sequences; the player can be as cool as they want to be without worrying about how many rolls they're triggering. Check out page 7 for more info.<br/><br/>- Faction reputation descriptors. Debt and Favor are still in the game, but players now have a semi-fixed word that describes what a Faction thinks of them. This descriptor is used by the GM to give them a cue when they play as the Faction. Descriptors come in five varieties; great, good, neutral, bad and terrible; earn enough Favor with a Faction, and you can choose a new, better descriptor (example: you were considered 'Mistrusted (Bad)' or 'Dangerous (Bad)' by the Galactic Police, but after earning enough Favor with them, you can go from Bad to Neutral; maybe you'll choose to be 'Useful (Neutral)' or 'Cautious (Neutral)'. Check out page 18 for more info.<br/><br/>Plus there are a bunch of smaller changes, like shuffling around the career skills, having a fixed amount of 'Narrative Wounds' (wounds defined by words rather than numbers), adding Codex Entries (a permanent information-based +1 that you gain through the Assessment move, to reward curiosity)  and changing the way Get Involved works (it now upgrades a roll from 6- to 7-9, or 7-9 to 10+, rather than just giving a +1).<br/><br/>If you have the chance, I invite you to give the rules a read-through; I sincerely appreciate any and all feedback, suggestions or questions. I'll be popping in regularly to answer any queries while I prepare myself for the next phase of development (seriously, it surprises me just how much anxiety the whole Kickstarter/publishing causes me. If anyone has any experience or advice about <i>that</i>...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gornul" title="Gornul"><img alt="Gornul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gornul">Gornul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429708/#Comment_429708" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T12:12:16+00:00" title="March 21, 2014 12:12PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am one of Archangel3d's Hangouts group players, and it has been an amazing ride to watch this game come together from the early-Alpha state up to now.<br/><br/>I have developed a set of character sheets for use in running Uncharted Worlds, whether online or in person.

Should I trash it for something else?

Strong opponents of bioengineering, overpopulation and expansion.<br/>\u2022\tAllied Prosperity (Merchant Consortium). A trade conglomeration spanning a dozen planetary governments.<br/><br/>Each of the [Underlined] words are chosen or described by one of the players; a big part of an early Uncharted Worlds story is letting the players make key decisions about the scenario\u2019s dynamics and politics. They decide who the actors are on this stage.\n<blockquote><i>Between two Jump points, the player\u2019s ship comes upon a large debris field, caused by a recent space battle. The ships belong to [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faction A</span>] and [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faction B</span>], and most are entirely destroyed. However, one vessel belonging to [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faction A</span>] is still intact enough to be emitting a distress beacon. In addition to having lost its engines, the ship is also suffering from another [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Major Issue</span>].<br/><br/>Onboard, boarding troops of [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faction B</span>] have taken control of the ship, imprisoning the [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faction A</span>] crew. In the ship\u2019s hold is a [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unique Thing</span>]. Eventually, the [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Major Issue</span>] becomes a lot more pressing/dangerous, and to make matters worse [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faction C</span>] shows up with a boarding ship of their own, demanding the [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unique Thing</span>].</i></blockquote>\nThe GM needs to weave the player prompts into the description; \u201cAfter the initial pelting of tiny materials that bounce off your shields, larger panels come into view. Drifter, what faction\u2019s symbol do you see on some of those panels?\u201d and then \u201cBut some of the other destroyed ships are of a different configuration; the fight wasn\u2019t one-sided. A massive wreck turns slowly, surrounded by a cloud of twisted metal. Wrench, you know only one faction makes ships in that particular torus configuration; which one?\u201d Etc<br/><br/>Most initial UW scenarios I\u2019ve run were built like this; pitting 2 or 3 Factions against each other, and discovering the politics and tension at the same time as the players. Because players have varying Debt and Favor with each faction, and different friends and enemies, the decision of who\u2019s fighting who, and who to support, tends to be one of politics, profit and ethics. It also allows the same scenario to play out dozens of different ways. For example: If Faction A is New Humanity, then the Cyborg will probably argue to rescue them from their captors. However, if Faction B is New Humanity, then the Cyborg player might rather help them fix up the ship they\u2019ve captured so that they can leave.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Borogove" title="Borogove"><img alt="Borogove" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Borogove">Borogove</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429973/#Comment_429973" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T14:57:34+00:00" title="March 25, 2014  2:57PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm new to the site and super-excited about UW; it's really scratching my Classic Traveller/Firefly itch. <br/><br/>Chargen and the associated Faction-introduction is so straightforward and pleasing that I think offering pre-generated characters and factions are almost a disservice.

Talked about the feedback here, and the philosophies of the Origins themselves; the how and why of the stat boosts, the skills granted by Origins, etc.<br/><br/>Origins were intended to give a selection of thematically linked skills from various careers, to give a few more options when building a character. That's why they have copies of career skills, rather than unique ones. The only unique skill that a career offers is its unique stat boost.<br/><br/>Excluding Artificial for the moment, the reasoning behind the 5 origins' stat boost is 'people who grew up in this milieu are more likely to at least be competent in that stat'. Thus the limitation of +2; your 'natural' +2 stat choice is who you are, the stat that gets upgraded (usually a +1 that becomes +2) is your cultural upbringing.<br/><br/>However, Artificial didn't feel quite special for two reasons. One, it did something that the other origins did, and nothing unique. And two, it was incongruous to be a genetically engineered/programmed to be good at a stat, but that stat was your +1 so that you could take skill to make it +2, and that your natural +2 stat was elsewhere.<br/><br/>So, two of the changes that are coming to the Origin stats;<br/>The 5 stat-specific skills (Decorum, Hard Knocks, New Horizons, Hard Labor and Wired) will have extra "fluff" mechanics to add to the +1 Stat. For example, Hard Labor will read something like "You can perform strenuous physical work for extended period of time before becoming exhausted. You gain +1 Physique (maximum +2)." This is a small change to give the skill more weight when considering the behavior and outlook of your character; someone who has Decorum should not just have more Influence, they should also be adept at etiquette and protocol.<br/><br/>The Artificial Origin will no longer have the 5 stat boosts. Instead, it will have 4 skills chosen from different careers, like the other Origins, and it will have the following Stat skill (wording is work in progress): "Paragon - You were engineered with a specific goal in mind. The stat you assign as +2 becomes +3 instead." Or something, I probably need better wording.<br/><br/><br/>Now, the question I have is; should Origins have one or more <i>unique</i> skills that are unavailable to careers?

Likewise, the Faction system seems at odds with having an established setting.<br/><br/>I'd rather see more building blocks and jumping off points. For example, for each pair of Faction types, what are some ways those Factions might come into conflict, and how might it involve the PCs? Or a selection of MacGuffins and a matrix of Faction/MacGuffin interactions. </blockquote>\nI agree that a big part of the game is the char gen and the Faction gen. That said, they are rather time consuming, I understand the need to have those things out of the way in order to just play the game. This is doubly true for folks who have not played before and haven't yet read through the rules. Dumping all those possibilities at once just leads to decision paralysis, especially if you're not familiar with the rules.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to further define the above scenario; having players chime in with important definitions is great, but some GMs feel more comfortable running off of a very predictable script. So I'll lock that all down, so that the GM can mentally prep ahead of time (not knowing who the Factions will be or what the Important Object is makes it very much more of an ad-lib game).<br/><br/>That said, having a 'Jump Point' of basic conflict combinations is a good idea for the final product. I'm thinking a pick-and-mix chart of elements, or even a randomizer, to inspire stories/scenarios.

I had originally planned to use it the week before, in a modified form, with one faction kidnapping someone from another faction planet-side (so not in space) and then the PCs fled that planet right away, so they had no chance to get involved. But since they ended that session stuck in the wrong part of deep space, I figured I'd just steal this scenario wholesale.<br/><br/>The PCs, aboard the Permanent Crimson, comes upon about a dozen ruined ships, half belonging to Striker Enterprises, the other half belonging to Xenolith. Striker is a private military op that Pevin Alsarth knows about from her days in the army stationed on an occupied world. She says they are pretty elite. Xenolith is a private company that does the same job as the scouts (the Permanent Crimson is an off-duty scout ship, Captain Severin is an off-duty scout). Ismail Tabari has heard of Xenolith working for his family before (he is a noble), and suspects they might go so far as to do kidnappings and stuff.<br/><br/>One ship still has people on it. The Crimson makes contact with a Striker team that has taken control of the large Xenolith ship and finds out that the Xenolith operators on board have sabotaged the engine and are barricaded inside the cargo bay. The Striker team tells them Xenolith is carrying illegal cargo.<br/><br/>The PCs don't trust the PMCs, so they dock with the cargo end of the Xenolith ship and talk to the Xenolith operatives. They say they are carrying survey drones, not robots (robots are illegal) to a client, for use on an abandoned planet that has been the ruin of many treasure-hunters.<br/><br/>Then the navy jumps into the hex. The Crimson fail a bunch of sensors rolls and don't get much info on them except a standard command to surrender. The Striker crew notifies the Xenolith operatives and demands they surrender. A majority of the Xenolith operatives ask to be rescued by the Permanent Crimson, a few refuse to abandon their cargo. The Permanent Crimson decide to book it out of there.<br/><br/>On the jump back to planets connected by actual trade routes, they find out that Xenolith was working for Omnitech, a company run by the oligarchs of the region. This does not mean they worked for the same faction that controlled the naval ships, but they came from the same world. Either side could be facing a quick death, and who knows where the hi-tech survey "drones" will end up?<br/><br/>The PCs tried to recruit one of the Xenolith operatives they rescued, but she wasn't too keen on staying with them, and got off at the first world with most of the other operatives they rescued.<br/><br/>When the ship docked at a scout base, the scout chief on site gave them a mission: take a bunch of data back to the first world that had some plot on it. So perhaps I will will still get to use the non-space modified version of the idea. It seemed to work pretty well this session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430596/#Comment_430596" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T21:07:37+00:00" title="April  6, 2014  9:07PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2014 9:08PM by Archangel3d.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I threw together a first prototype of a character sheet.

Each time it triggers, one player rolls (preferably a different player each time). It's a 'random encounter' Move, but the 'encounters' are between the player in question and one of the other characters onboard (PCs or NPCs). On a 10+ they bond over something that happens during those days, on a 7-9 there's a minor argument, disagreement, annoyance or squabble, and on a 6- something is said or done that causes a rift between the two characters. The specifics are up to the player and the one who controls the target (a player for a PC or a Loyal NPC, or the GM for an NPC passenger)<br/><br/>Now, to be fair, this is just a tentative Move, I'd like to see how it plays out. But I'm having trouble coming up with a good sci-fi themed name for a Move about being stuck in a cramped, claustrophobic environment with other slightly dysfunctional people for days and weeks on end. After, one of the Principles of the game is \u201cThe Ship is Home, the Crew is its Dysfunctional Family\u201d. <br/><br/>I\u2019d kinda like a Move name that expresses that idea of being trapped with the same people for too long, with a sci-fi theme. I tend to prefer subtle reference to popular sci-fi (like \u2018Boldly Go\u2019, \u2018Acquisition\u2019  and \u2018Calibrations\u2019 Moves).<br/><br/>Any ideas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431047/#Comment_431047" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T15:15:18+00:00" title="April 15, 2014  3:15PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first hunch would be something like <i>cramped quarters</i>.

Not sure what you mean by cabin fever not fitting the theme--nautical stuff translates very nicely into space and there is a rich tradition in sci-fi of treating space-faring military engagements as a natural extension of the naval tradition. The core cultural and practical problems of naval expeditions have robust analogues in space-faring sci-fi. Cabin fever is hardly an exception.<br/><br/>Also "Between You Me and the Bulkhead" works just fine as a move name. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> If it doesn't work for your aesthetic, that's another thing. But for my part, I don't feel like move names need to be particularly straight-forward or punchy unless that is specifically demanded by the aesthetic of the system; longer and more theatrical move names would be essential, for example, in a Discworld hack. But not exclusively so. Long (of for that matter long and theatrical) need not mean farcical or insincere.<br/><br/>Directness is a tool that isn't right for every job. With the basic moves, you don't want cluttered names getting in the way. With more peripheral or situational moves ... having a little extra wordiness can give the situation that extra dash of salt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431066/#Comment_431066" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T21:21:27+00:00" title="April 15, 2014  9:21PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2014 9:22PM by Archangel3d.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, don't get me wrong, the names are all good, they're just not quite what I'm looking for.

Being shut up in small spaces.<br/><br/><br/>On the move: I wonder if it wouldn't work better as something like "When you make an extended journey through interstellar space" rather than "every few days." As a matter of pacing, I think it sounds cool to roll it when you do a sort of fade-to-black; the journey is going to take a few days and no one has anything they particularly want to do on board the vessel.<br/><br/>If your goal is just to fulfill the pinciple, though, you don't need to roll--just make an MC move. If you want to make it more player facing, perhaps something like:<br/><br/>"When you make an extended journey through interstellar space, roll [something, probably flat?] for the most restless character. Pick another character. On a 10+, pick one of the following and take +1 influence with that character. On a 7-9, the MC picks one of the following. On a 6-, pick one; the MC will provide complication, unforseen consequence, or cost.<br/><br/>--You and another character have bonded in some way over the past few days. Say how.<br/>--A minor disagreement or annoyance passed between you and another character. Describe it.<br/>--Something happened between you and another character that caused anger, bad blood or hurt feelings. "<br/><br/>It's very, very rough, but hopefully useful in some manner. There are a fair number of moving bits in it that can be removed or adjusted to taste, but hopefully you see the core of what I'm getting at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431071/#Comment_431071" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-15T23:13:15+00:00" title="April 15, 2014 11:13PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cabin fever gets applied to ships sometimes, too.

Maybe have specific Travel GM moves that are called upon every few days (I still prefer 'every few days' rather than 'once per trip', mainly because I envision longer voyages, and I'd like two or three such interactions.)<br/><br/>Actually, I think there may be some merit to looking at Torchbearer's Grind mechanic and applying it to the ship and its crew. Like, every d6 days of space travel, choose either a minor mechanical malfunction or a social malfunction between two of the crew.<br/><br/>Also, on the subject of minor malfunctions, I kinda like the idea that the ship has X number of permanent, annoying, but non-threatening malfunctions/quirks that just won't go away. I almost feel like it should be a character creation question or something, to give the ship a bit of personality. Stuff like "the loud hum" or "the creaks in the piping" or "the smell of the recycled air".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431128/#Comment_431128" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T15:54:07+00:00" title="April 16, 2014  3:54PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2014 3:55PM by Gwathdring.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, cool!

But even most truly brilliant operas areridiculous and melodramatic and most of even the best would be utter tripe were it not for the awesome music. In particular the height of Italian Opera was just copy-cat blockbuster after copy-cat blockbuster. We remember the more unique and interesting ones as canonical and forget how much of it was just silly melodrama with formulaic singing and composition.<br/><br/>Put differently, there's a reason they're called "soap operas" and not just "soap theater."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431129/#Comment_431129" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T16:01:00+00:00" title="April 16, 2014  4:01PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about the, uh, <i>other side</i> of close quarters?

I use them in my Traveller/AW game (it's more concerned with space trading economics, though, and less with good old adventure). But probably once per trip is a good number. If you don't like the idea of a longer trip having just one upkeep roll, break it up into multiple legs. Only give ships enough fuel to go X far (or 1 upkeep roll far) before they have to refuel at a starport or gas giant.

But even most truly brilliant operas areridiculous and melodramatic and most of even the best would be utter tripe were it not for the awesome music. In particular the height of Italian Opera was just copy-cat blockbuster after copy-cat blockbuster. We remember the more unique and interesting ones as canonical and forget how much of it was just silly melodrama with formulaic singing and composition.<br/><br/>Put differently, there's a reason they're called "soap operas" and not just "soap theater."</blockquote>\nYeah, I appreciate that Opera as a term is quite expansive and covers many different creative periods and themes - but I would feel a <i>bit</i> pushed to call <i>Firefly</i> a Space Opera when it's certainly a Space Soap or a Space Western (more of a soap...).

Seriously, if you don't think Soap Opera and Opera are really, really, really close together in terms of how over-the-top and extravagantly theatrical they are you have a very limited sampling of both. The Ring Cycle, Tosca and similarly famous operas have been <i>staged</i> with particular extravagance by particularly major troupes/houses, but if that's what you're getting at there really isn't much on television that compares. Ostentation is a big thing in live stage arts--musicals, operas, magic shows, circuses. But beyond ostentation and (of course) musical composition, you need look no further than day time television in particular on the Spainish Language channel to find Opera's equal.<br/><br/>Wagner is a really unusual force in opera in quite a number of ways. Verdi is a much better conceptual average, I feel, of what Opera offers--and take the music away from Verdi and you've got Days of Our Lives and General Hospital episode arcs ready for camera with only a few tweaks.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call Firefly Space Opera, for my part. It's too ... slick and down-tempo. I don't say that just because it's not "campy" either. The Vorkosogan Saga isn't campy and that's very Space Opera, to me. The drama is thicker and more up-tempo. It's more high-strung and sprawling. If Miles, Murder and Mayhem is an Opera, Firefly is a low-key stage play.<br/><br/>Mass Effect? Space Opera.<br/><br/>Halo? Not Space Opera for all that it is schlocky and campy and high-octane.<br/><br/>Farscape?

I haven't watched BSG so I can't say one way or the other.<br/><br/>Farscape has a feeling of ... grandness, bigness, legend, pomp-and-circumstance. With Firefly the scale and the stakes feel different; the focus always comes back to the characters as people. Firefly feels smaller and more intimate. It doesn't feel big. Farscape feels big. It feels sprawling. BSG could go either way, not having seen it--the premise is rich with over-the-top potential with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, the whole Skinwalker thing, etc ... but from what I've heard it plays those cards fairly close to the chest and focuses on smaller things a lot of the time.<br/><br/>I'm a little too tired to explain it very well but the crux of it is that: it's a tonal thing. It's about the sum of the parts, not the parts themselves. Not all operas are melodramatic and/or ostentatious in any case.<br/><br/>If you break it down to plot elements the way you do in your post (family living on a starship, outlaws, a web of obligations and debts), we could essentially erase all genre and tonal distinctions entirely. We could similarly equate Harry Potter and Mistborn or Mistborn and Ocean's Eleven. There are contexts in which that kind of barrier breaking is useful and fruitful but I don't think this is such a context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Niko" title="Niko"><img alt="Niko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/nN2P8QVOIEP27.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Niko">Niko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431153/#Comment_431153" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T23:48:53+00:00" title="April 16, 2014 11:48PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>I dunno if it should be a flat Roll, or if it should be Roll+Influence.</blockquote>\nSeems like Influence would be more accurate.

It can be any skill from any career. New skills are earned by achieving milestones; performing actions or experiencing events that are directly related to the skill in question. The player needs to accomplish a number of milestones equal to the number of skills they already have (i.e. 4 at the start). All skills in your careers start the game with 1 milestone earned already, so it\u2019s faster to earn skills within your careers than outside of them.<br/><br/>Milestones are specific to each skill, and a player can only earn one milestone per session (if they do stuff that falls in multiple categories, they choose which one applies). They can accomplish the same milestone multiple times in consecutive sessions, but they have to be different situations/actions; a continuation of the same action/situation won\u2019t earn a second milestone.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ky16XZasoPRXM0NnpQZHhmbWM/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><b>Here\u2019s an example.</b></a><br/><br/>Thoughts?

The skills you <i>do</i> have actually allow you to accomplish milestones for skills you don't in a very organic sense. Take Performance; with it, you could set up situations to earn a milestone in Authority, Reputation or Crew: Followers. And it totally tracks, narratively. Spend enough sessions leveraging your performance/art from Performer, and you'll eventually earn yourself a Reputation, too!<br/><br/>Super excited about this, this was one of the biggest holes in my design for the longest time.

It's a bit bare-bones right now, but I'll try to toss in some updates when I can. Feel free to pop in with any feedback, suggestions or questions!<br/><br/>- I reworked injuries and Brace For Impact (the armor Move), added Cramped Quarters and changed the philosophy behind Assessment. I also gave the Clothing more customization, like Weapons and Vehicles. With the changes to Brace For Impact, Armor values have been slightly increased; there is a much more significant difference between wearing armor and not wearing armor, but it limits the other choices you have for your Clothing.<br/><br/>- A few skills are getting modified to a) make them cooler, and/or b) keep them in line with updated mechanics.<br/><br/>- I will hopefully be in mechanical lockdown by this time next week. No more major rules changes; I'll be writing the detailed explanations of the Moves, GM Moves, skills, and other elements of the game.

It felt cluttered and it rarely came up in play; most of the time, the situation that could have delt with that just called for a Face Adversity using +Tech. At the same time, commanding robots or AI used +Influence because of the Command move. <br/><br/>I took a step back and examined what I really wanted out of the move; a way to interact and give commands to computer systems, AI and robots. Ultimately, Program should be a variant of Command (the +Influence standard Move) but for technology; getting 'loyal' programming/electronics to perform a dictated action to the best of its ability.<br/><br/>As a side note, this means that Artificial Intelligence (the Academic career/Artificial origin skill) allows you to make systems loyal enough to Program, and greatly expands the scope of what that system can be commanded to do; you couldn't Program the ship to pilot itself (or not very well), but if your AI was in the piloting console, then the AI could auto-pilot the ship, and you'd use your +Tech to order it to do so.<br/><br/>I feel that it makes the Move much more robust and sci-fi.<br/><br/>The new Move:<br/><br/><b>PROGRAM</b> (+Tech)<br/>When you transmit instructions to robots, AI or other computer systems that are open to your directives, Roll+Tech. <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On a 10+</span>, they follow your instructions to the best of their ability. <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On a 7-9</span>, they follow your instructions, but suffer degradation, bugs, glitches or other breakdowns.

For example, you might choose the body-type "brittle" from Space, the mien "pallid" from Academic and the outfit "antiquated gravsuit" from Explorer. I haven't decided if a player should be restricted to picking just one item from each playbook (i.e., if you choose an outfit from one playbook, you <i>have </i>to choose mien and body-type from the other playbooks) or being more flexible and allowing the player to choose any combination of items from his or her three playbooks (i.e., allowing a player, in theory, to choose his/her body-type, mien, and outfit from just one playbook).<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432515/#Comment_432515" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T07:46:34+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  7:46AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...

Pretty big changes coming down the pipe, but I'm continuing with v 0.82 for the time being; there will likely be bigger gaps between versions. <b>Also, looking for ideas/inspiration/opinions, see below</b><br/><br/>A sample of the changes in the works:<br/>- Crews have been removed from all careers. They are now one of the choices a player can take as a starting loadout.<br/>- The 4 new starting loadouts are: Fighter (better weapon), Survivor (better gear/armor), Driver (simple vehicle), Leader (crew). Each loadout also gets a simple weapon and a common set of gear.<br/>- New skills have been added to the careers to replace the Crew skills (more on that later)<br/>- Invention (Engineering) and Experiment (Academic) are being redesigned because they were too vague and open to confusion<br/>- The Explorer career skills are being revisited to be bolder and more daring. Currently, Tenacious (which was a boring +1 on failure) is being replaced by Recklessness (when attempting something foolhardy/dangerous for the first time, you can assure success at great personal risk and/or protect allies from the consequences of your attempt)<br/><br/>However, the biggest change/issue I'm currently trying to resolve is a pretty fundamental one; the confusion caused between Tech and Ingenuity. I separated the "mental/logic/creativity" stat in two; the Use Computer aspect alone was so strong and frequently used in a Sci-Fi setting that, as a stat, it had more weight in play than all the other skilled/science/engineering actions put together. So the divide (as laid out below) has to stay more or less as-is...<br/><br/>However, the <i>names</i> of the stats themselves repeatedly cause confusion because they aren't unique and descriptive enough. So I'm trawling for ideas; <b>if you have a suggestion for unique names for these stats, I'm open to any and all suggestions.</b> I need excellent terms that clearly define what's in each stat without overstepping into the other stat. The boundaries need to be as clear as possible, to avoid confusion.<br/><br/><b>Stat A:</b><br/>- Repair, Maintenance, Construction<br/>- First Aid, Medicine, Chemistry, Experimentation<br/>- Economics, Logistics, Administration<br/><br/><b>Stat B:</b><br/>- Computer Use, Programming, Hacking<br/>- Sensors, Scanning, Diagnostics<br/>- AI, Virtual Reality<br/><br/>This has been one of the big issues from the playtests, and I'm looking for inspiration.

Seems totally clear to me.  I suppose some players are thinking "ingenuity" can be applied to "tech" problems (and hey, maybe it actually can, at a -1 or something).

This is a Bad Thing (tm). I'd designed the leveling to be a logical progression, achieving milestones related to a skill before earning that skill. However, the nature of the game means the characters will often not accomplish an act that is close to a skill they want. This leads them to either pick a skill randomly ("good enough") or just abandon the idea of getting a skill ("meh").<br/><br/>I've been toying with the idea of centralizing character definition and advancement into the careers themselves, rather than in the individual skills. <br/><br/><b>Description:</b> Taking a page from other *World games, I'd give a choice of one-word descriptions ("rugged", "emaciated", "portly", "scarred", etc). These lists would be in the origins and careers; you'd choose 1 from your origin and 1 from each career to give your description. For example: 'Filthy' from a Poverty origin, 'Palid' from an Academic career and 'Wiry' from a Clandestine career. (kudos to Sharnett for this suggestion, I really like it)<br/><br/><b>Quarters:</b> The description of your personal quarters in the ship would be picked from a list in your career, rather than a per-skill list (so any Academic could have a lab in their section of the skip if they wanted, etc).<br/><br/><b>XP:</b> At the end of each session, you earn 1 XP towards a single career (assuming you meet a milestone for it), and when you earned enough XP in that career, you'd level up and pick a Skill from there. This would lead to broader milestone achievements, which fit with the general outlook/personality of the career, rather than the minutea of individual skills. Your own careers start with 1xp already (making it faster to earn a level in that career), but you can earn XP in any career.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433926/#Comment_433926" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T18:50:27+00:00" title="June 16, 2014  6:50PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quarters: While at first it sounds weird that one character might select a lab if they don't know how to use it (didn't take the "lab move" or whatever), actually if you write the options in a certain way, it lets one player pick something for the ship that helps support another player's character, instead of their own. In general, I like the idea that you have a choice between options that make your character "better" and options that make the ship "better," if you know what I mean, so if one player can pick something that is more for the ship as a whole than just for them, cool.<br/><br/>XP: Yeah, probably a lot easier to do it that way. Now you have to go through painful edits as you trim the lists down, though, right?

Physics, math, medicine, archaeology, psychology, biology; they all have a place in most space operas. Now, I'll admit that they tend to add on prefixes to <i>specialize</i> the fields and make them sound more sci-fi (especially prefixes like 'xeno'; xenobotany, xenobiology, etc. But those are more narrow specifications (a common sci-fi trope about the microspecialization of the future workforce) that still fall under their scientific branch. All that said, I'm not opposed to a name-change.<br/><br/>Colonist - It may be my Pakistani heritage, but the word "Colonial" has veeeeeery different connotations to me than 'Colonist'. I know they're of the same etymological roots, but "Colonial" refers to a not-very-nice era of humanity, and belongs in textbooks. 'Colonist', on the other hand, belongs in such staple sci-fi phrases as "We've got to get there in time to save the _____" and "This creature has been eating all the ______" :P<br/>(Not that a 'Colonial' space opera setting wouldn't be interesting. Conquistadors. In. Spaaaaaaace!)<br/><br/>Pioneer - That works<br/><br/>Void - Not quite the adjective I'd look for. That said, I toyed with "Stellar" instead of "Spacer". The main issue is the slang usage of "Stellar" as a superlative rather than an adjective denoting "of the stars". Also "Astral" is too sword and sorcery fantasy a term despite being accurate.

In my experience, "colonial" refers to the white dudes that move in and treat Indians like shit, and "colonist" refers to the white dudes that move in after the Indians are all dead and thus have the privilege to ignore them (the other Indians, I mean). To put it bluntly.<br/><br/>I think more people than not will probably have your reaction, where "colonial" feels more oppressive than "colonist," but I also think the pulp sci-fi colonist narrative is more often a way of recontextualizing the American colonial experience in a way that erases the Native peoples, and less often an actual intellectual exercise that imagines what would really happen if humanity left Earth for other planets. I mean, part of the allure of colonizing exoplanets is exactly that: it offers all the glory of colonialism without any of the Natives. As such, the only real human experience it can reference without erasing people is the conquest of Antarctica, which is a far shallower well than even the smallest area of the Americas.<br/><br/>Obviously, your game, go with what you're comfortable with. To me, both words seem pretty similarly full of white privilege (also: Settler!), and there will be others who feel the same. Not that I feel personally bothered by either one being used in a game or anything (or games that romanticize the colonization of space). I might even prefer Settler because it has a specifically Canadian context and would thus feel (to me) to be more aware of its oppressive origins. Other names you could use instead of Colonist could be Migrant and Diaspora, with the connotations of having left somewhere less-than-enthusiastically, or even having fled.<br/><br/>Anyway, on the subject of names, it doesn't seem entirely clear to me, just from the descriptions, what the difference between Colonist, Frontier, and Spacer is, exactly. Colonist sounds like an advance terraforming mission? You could call it Terraformer maybe? I feel like Pioneer is a better name for the Colonist description than it is for the Frontier description.<br/><br/>Frontier sounds like people who live on Dune? But that doesn't have to be on any sort of actual frontier, because of space. Also, if they live on a world that is actually hostile and not just hard to live on, they're kind of the same as Spacers, because people living on a world with boiling seas and corrosive air live the same as people who live in space, right? They both live in entirely built environments. Or are these people just supposed to be isolated and low-tech? Isolated, low-tech, and hostile environment don't automatically go together in my mind. Maybe Isolated is a better name?<br/><br/>If Spacers are supposed to be growing up in microgravity, the unique feature of outer space, you could call them Zero-G, Low-G, Low Grav, Flyers, Floaters, etc. If this one is supposed to include people who live on space-station-like environments on inhospitable worlds, maybe you need a different name. Sardines? Troglodytes? Can't think of one right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sharnett" title="sharnett"><img alt="sharnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sharnett">sharnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434756/#Comment_434756" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-03T04:49:51+00:00" title="July  3, 2014  4:49AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2014 6:01AM by sharnett.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, I meant no offence by suggesting "Colonial", and I'm sorry if any was caused any.

No need to state intention, though you certainly can just to give the GM a heads up and to remind yourself to keep an eye out for opportunities. Note that already having a career's skills allows you to more easily accomplish the career's milestones in a natural manner, thereby allowing you to easily improve in your own career paths. If you want to gain a non-career XP, you'll have to make a conscious effort to step outside of your own skills/comfort zone and do things you're not already good at. As a side note, it was pointed out that the Origin's 'Stat Move' is a seemingly "better" pick than one of the cross-class skills, because those skills can be earned later. However, having a cross-class skill from your origin makes it subtly easier to gain XP in the career that skill comes from.<br/><br/>I've playtested a previous version in which each individual skill had its own milestones. Didn't work out at all (I think I posted about it a bit earlier in the thread). This new XP system still needs to be tested.

It's obvious what's going on if you're familiar with AW etc., but could be confusing to a new player. <br/><br/>I think it's inherently a bad idea to treat Armor like the other Stats, so maybe in the Stats section you should point out that sometimes you'll roll with one of 5 character Stats, and sometimes you'll roll with some other value like Armor or Availability.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435083/#Comment_435083" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-10T07:53:43+00:00" title="July 10, 2014  7:53AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2014 7:55AM by Archangel3d.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True.

They fundamentally altered or ignored or added to the basic rules to one degree or another (Cybernetics as purchasable skills? 'Mind' as a 6th stat to use telepathy? Alien diversity/non-humanoid aliens?). Also, on a thematic standpoint, I don't want to make assumptions about another player's campaign universe by including those 3 in the base game; I want the individual GM to have a say as to whether player-character telepaths, robots or cyborgs exist, or whether aliens are playable character origins. After a lot of internal wrestling, I decided to delay working on those three until I have released the core game, to give that tricky design space a much more solid foundation. They will come, I've saved a lot of my design work, but I don't know when.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Borogove" title="Borogove"><img alt="Borogove" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Borogove">Borogove</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435189/#Comment_435189" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T09:04:08+00:00" title="July 13, 2014  9:04AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435192/#Comment_435192" name="Item_194" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T13:33:46+00:00" title="July 13, 2014  1:33PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we had our first run of Uncharted Worlds last night (combined with a very nice barbeque). We didn't get to see the characters in play as we spent our available 3\xbd hours creating them and building our little slice of the galaxy.<br/>We began by jotting down a few base rules for how our universe would work.<br/>1: There are fixed jump points in a network. Some of them lead nowhere but you can still get back. Jump points are stationary and rather far from the star. It takes at least several days to get there.<br/>2: You can't fly FTL, and there's no FTL communications. However, there are comm-sattelites that constantly jump back and forth at their designated jump-points, delivering messages.<br/>3: No aliens. At least, not yet.<br/>4: Earth is a myth, lost in the mists of time. <br/>5: Most worlds are shaped by the original Terran cultures that colonized them, although there is, of course, overlap.<br/>6: There are both single and multi-system governments, with some large empires of 10+ systems.<br/>7: Only shuttles land on planets. Starships dock at orbiting stations connected to planets via space elevator.<br/><br/>Here's what we discovered:<br/>Character creation takes a damn long time compared to other AW hacks due to having to read through and select two carreers and an origin. On top of that you have to set some standards/rules for the universe to get everyone on the same page. You also have to get some somewhat detailed starting factions together. It's fun, but time-consuming.<br/><br/>What we hacked together:<br/>We stole a page from Monsterhearts to create the crew. We'd decided early on that actually <i>having</i> a crew was necessary for the gameplay, as that would give me (the GM) some ready cannon-fodder/possible hostages/interpersonal crisis/story hooks. We needed names, and we needed to make them matter, their deaths mean something, other than "We lost redshirts 2, 7 and 15. Hire some new ones next time we dock". We divided them by department and then created interdepartmental relationships. We'll be doing a relationship map to keep better track.<br/>We also drew the ship, deciding what it would look like and where the various departments were located.  <br/>Mostly for flavour, but also to decide what crew to get sucked into space during battle. I know this isn't covered by the rules, but it really helps immersion.<br/><br/>What I <i>wish</i> we'd hacked:<br/>It takes a bit to create a backstory, so what we decided we needed was a Monster of the Week-style backstory generator. It could be located on the origin sheet and would speed things up, not to mention making it easier to remember the basic backstory between characters. On top of that, it's very easy to build upon.<br/>A faction background generator would be nice as well, as would a ship relationship (how'd you get on the vessel).<br/><br/>In two weeks, the trade/salvage ship HMMS Pandora, an old but servicable tub of a ship will take to the stars with its crew of miscreants, wash-outs and grizzled veterans.<br/><br/>I'll crosspost this to the Uncharted Worlds forum on Barf Forth Apocalyptica.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435193/#Comment_435193" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-13T14:11:04+00:00" title="July 13, 2014  2:11PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds great Tore!

As a GM, I absolutely love asking a player to come up with a backstory on the spot for an NPC or Faction or themselves, especially colored/tainted by the character's own personal perspective/biases. That usually means that I leave a whole bunch of background undefined before the game starts, and let that stuff get filled in organically. Same goes for the crew; to borrow a saying from J. Michael Straczynski, they are defined at the speed of plot.<br/><br/>Obviously, it goes without saying that this is just my personal preference. And though I'm writing UW with that philosophy in mind, I'm in no way opposed to a group sitting down and drawing up the important backgrounds beforehand.

We did decide to make up a few sample star systems just as a warm-up.<br/>As for the crew creation, it makes it a LOT easier for the players to remember the crew <i>consistently</i> and bring them into play. It also helps to have all the npcs out in plain view for all to see, with a word or two of description. It helps cement relationships and make them three-dimensional. It doesn't mean we don't create NPC's on the fly, we most certainly do. And when we do, we write down the npc on an index card and put it on the table for all to see. Otherwise we'd just forget them.<br/>This has the added bonus of the players being able to draw in npc's they find interesting, not to mention keeping them aware they exist between sessions. In our GM-less Monsterhearts game one of my more artistically minded (and skilled) players drew every single pc and npc.<br/><br/>On a side note, I just got a chat this morning from one of my players, who'd apparently been inspired by our world-creation, has almost finished sketching the ship. Another player who'll be a guest whenever he's in town, has taken it a step further and plans to build the ship out of lego's :-) So you see how excited my players are about UW (I'll send you some pictures later). Admittedly, they may be going a bit over board :-)<br/><br/>As for the more technical aspects, I would prefer skins. To me, skins are great at creating a beginning character that's playable from the get-go, and it makes it easy to add back-story as you go along. It also gives you a feel for the type of person you're playing, the personaity behind it. It also makes introductions quicker and, for lack of a better word, deeper. My experience with skins from Monsterhearts and Monster of the Week is that you simply get to <i>play</i> quicker, instead of spending a lot of time having characters meet and greet. You get to the meat of the game a lot faster, and you also get a lot of background in a very short time for the GM to play with.<br/><br/>What you might want to include at some point in the game is a 3:16-like planet creation list, a basic randomizer. One is also includes one for alien species.<br/>Neither of these are <i>needed</i>, but they can be damned nice to have as a gm tool for when your head starts spinning when the players are asking too many questions and your imagination is lacking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435308/#Comment_435308" name="Item_199" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-15T10:16:59+00:00" title="July 15, 2014 10:16AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2014 10:18AM by Archangel3d.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome, that's great feedback!

Skins are Monsterhearts Playbooks. I highly recommend reading Monsterhearts, because debt, or "strings" in that game, an emotional tie you have with someone that can give them a mechanical bonus against you. You burn the string for the bonus. <br/>Monsterhearts also has conditions others can play on. Usually social. For instance, if my character has been embarrassed in front of the whole class, that character might have the condition "humiliated". Until that condition is removed through the fiction, anyone can bring it into play in the fiction to get a +1 to their roll against the character with the condition.<br/><br/>For UW, strings could actually be applied in a slightly different form to illustrate debt or favours or even blackmail to give a bonus in negotiation situations or to manipulate. Conditions could as well, both in social situations as well as combat. For instance, a ship could recieve the condition "Shields down" or "hull breach", and the condition would have a fictional effect that could then be negated through fiction.

I might have some feedback for you, if you're interested.<br/><br/>Firstly though, I should note, that I have a knack for being negative or perhaps just appearing that way, so please don't let me discourage you!<br/><br/>First of all, I should talk about what I love about the game. I think you totally nailed Principles, both player and GM. It's probably the best advice how to play characters I have seen in game so far. I think the whole idea of "in here/out there", debt and ship and stuff is great. And, most of all, the origin / career / career is one of the best innovative things someone did with Apocalypse Engine. I love the Factions. I love the name "Interface". I love all the references (Influence is about "making friends and influencing people"). I love how the equipment works. And more.<br/><br/>Now, I have some other stuff. I'll try to make simple bullet (or laser) points instead of long paragraph.<br/><br/>I wonder about the stats. I'm sure you thought about this already, but Physique is kind of the odd man out. Mettle is kind of like Hard and Cool from AW, it represents how good you're with violence, and when things go sideways. Influence represents how good you're with people. Interface represents how good you're with computers and cyberspace. Expertise represents how good you're with non-computer tech, stuff like medicine, labwork, mad science, hyperspace engines, etc. But the physique does not represent how good you're with something, it represents how fit, string and pretty you are.<br/><br/>That's kind of strange. And especially with character strapped for points, like military technocrat (archetype that should be called "Motoko"), you end with those weird combinations of stats with -1 Physique and +1 Mettle, where the character is pretty good when firing rifle, but bad when firing shotgun, or the other way around. And while Physique works with Face Adversity, it is kind of difficult to use with Assessment.<br/><br/>So, I would like to suggest dropping Physique. It really doesn't do anything that wouldn't make sense for Influence or Mettle to do, it works on different level of abstraction than other stats, and makes some things kind of weird. If five stats are required, I would propose splitting Mettle, not by the physical / emotional side, but by the pressure / violence axis, the way AW does it. That would put shooting gun, and commanding ship when torpedoes are flying on different stats, for example.<br/><br/>Now, mostly small things that concern the 0.7.5 -&gt; 0.82:<br/><br/>1) I love that NPC crews are equipment instead of moves. It works much better.<br/><br/>2) I'm sad to to see the Artificial Origin go. Especially when it was Harder Better Faster Stronger! (to be frank, Advanced, Regimented or Violent works for Artificial characters depending on how and where they were created - vat-grown human with better computer connection works with Advanced, combat replicant works with Violent - but having it's own flavor was nice)<br/><br/>3) I'm sad to see the geeky computer move (/HAYWIRE /BREAK /DELTREE) go. It really screamed science fiction to me. But I guess it was too geeky for normal people? And I'm not sure Coding needs separate move.<br/><br/>4) I like the equipment cleanup. I'm not sure how to work with Gadgets really, but I like how I can get fighter package and +hidden +melt +cut pistol for integrated laser for my runaway replicant.<br/><br/>5) I'm not sure about the "there are four things that may be on your ship" instead of "you origin gives you interesting detail about you living space". More stuff is good, obviously, but I liked how before it was kind of about the character, while now it is about the ship. If I could, I would probably return the little detail about living space back to Origin, and make huge list of the things that can be on ship and have every player chose two as part of ship creation, that way you can have both.<br/><br/>That's all I can think of for now. I'll be looking forward to answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436572/#Comment_436572" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T10:23:47+00:00" title="August  6, 2014 10:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2014 10:28AM by Archangel3d.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya RS. First off, thanks for your kind words: believe me, this is far from a negative post. I've had a LOT worse. My ego is purring nicely at your compliments, hehe.<br/><br/>Lemme see if I can\u2019t address some of your concerns.<br/><br/>Physique: I find it very interesting that you question this stat; most of the time, it\u2019s the split between Expertise and Interface (called Ingenuity and Tech, back in the day) which drew comments. I guess the rename there worked well enough, haven\u2019t heard any comments about them since then. Anywho, Physique is indeed the most \u201cnatural\u201d of the stats; while the others are all somewhat cerebral, Physique is the only \u2018Body\u2019 stat. I felt it important to have, specifically because it covers so many of the more action-oriented situations.<br/><br/>Basically, I felt the distinction between long ranged combat and close quarters fighting was important enough to fall into two separate stats. Perhaps it's my Warhammer 40k side showing up. :P I can totally see \u2018violence\u2019 and \u2018pressure\u2019 being the split instead, but I prefer to have something that covers purely athletic situations. It\u2019s probably my most used Face Adversity stat. Sure it\u2019s more reactive than the other stats, but I\u2019m ok with that. I don\u2019t disagree with your statement at all, by the way, but Physique has proven useful enough as a stat to warrant keeping. <br/><br/>Physique Assessments: Climbing/hiking through hostile terrain to make an Assessment about the terrain, wildlife, etc. Spelunking into an asteroid to make an Assessment about the minerals, resources or alien ruins within. Seducing/sleeping with someone to make an Assessment about them (as an alternative to charming them with Influence). Beating the snot out of someone/threatening violence until the subject disgorges all the information about the subject you want.<br/><br/>Artificial Origin: As I mentioned earlier, in this thread, I love the Artificial Origin, but I feel that it would have to bend the rules to do the archetype justice. So I wanted to complete the basic game rules first, and I\u2019ve pushed them into a secondary material. I\u2019ll probably eventually write up expanded rules for Cyborgs, Mutants, Psionics and Aliens.<br/><br/>Run Program: The old \u2018use computer\u2019 Move was fun, but not especially useful. It was a bit too restrictive for a *World style game, and tried to cover too many possibilities. The new Program works basically like a \u201cCommand Computer\u201d, which is a lot more freeform and robust. Still, I agree that I miss the /Deltree and such. Hmmm\u2026 maybe I can rename the Technocrat\u2019s moves? I\u2019ll look into it.<br/><br/>Gadgets: I\u2019m currently re-evaluating the implementation of Gadgets. Right now they\u2019re too nebulous and are stuck in a weird zone between fluff, mechanics and potentially abused system. There will probably be changes coming down the pipe on those.<br/><br/>Ship rooms: I tried the big list approach in playtests, when I was doing rapid iteration on the revamp of character creation. Turns out that just having the big list leads to the dreaded Peanut Butter dilemma, a pitfall of design. The living space theme/feel, however, is something that could be included somewhere in character creation.<br/><br/>Again, thanks for your great feedback, and I hope you have fun with the system. I\u2019ll be posting something I\u2019ve been working on later today to get people\u2019s general impressions; I\u2019ve revamped and seriously tightened up the whole economic system of the game; Debt, Favor, Standing, Acquisition, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RainbowSommelier" title="RainbowSommelier"><img alt="RainbowSommelier" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/227/nP4IQP04NLGH1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RainbowSommelier">RainbowSommelier</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436775/#Comment_436775" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T13:20:43+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  1:20PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 1:24PM by RainbowSommelier.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Physique: I find it very interesting that you question this stat; most of the time, it\u2019s the split between Expertise and Interface (called Ingenuity and Tech, back in the day) which drew comments.

Physique is way broader than I assumed, I guess because of the AW model there hot is both how pretty you are, and hos influential you are, so I would never expect to roll Physique to seduce someone, for example. But this way it makes sense, thanks.<br/><br/>I would have never guessed from the description of Assessment that you can do Physical assessment (and gain a Codex entry) using Physique by sleeping with someone to gain information.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to use Mettle, then. I guess it is both cool and hard from AW, no? And I know this isn't usually the highest priority in Apocalypse Engine games, but my inner realism nerd is unsure about how shooting someone with pistol and shotgun is completely different from shooting someone with rifle at the same range <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I noticed that thing about Expertise and Interface, but I also read you explanation upthread, and it makes sense. Also, Interface is such a cool name that I would forgive it even being completely useless (which it isn't).<br/><br/>Now I kind of wonder about the stat descriptions. You have to put -1 to one stat, that's how it works (unless you gain Origin move to counteract the -1, which is interesting from roleplaying standpoint, but not very good idea from character optimization standpoint). From the description of stats that means every character is either<br/>1) someone who falls apart under pressure,<br/>2) ugly or unfit or unhealthy,<br/>3) uncreative, slow and stupid,<br/>4) someone who can't deal with people,<br/>5) someone who isn't good with computers.<br/><br/>That's fine I guess, I have the experience of everyone who isn't playing hacker taking -1 Interface (though it was Tech when we played) and I guess hackers have to deal with it. But from the actual moves, Expertise makes you medic, doctor and mechanic. Influence makes you mostly trader and business man. Mettle and Physique seem to by mostly about fighting. I'm not sure the descriptions fit.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm discounting Assessment and Face Adversity or something?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Also, Apocalypse Engine is weird in one way -- the failure may be rather decoupled from the person failing. Since the system kind of removes the "nothing happened" and since GM is supposed to be fun of the PCs, fail may often mean that something out of control of the PCs went wrong. Failed stealth may mean there's one more patrol, not that you stupidly made yourself visible. Fail means something went wrong, but it's not necessarily your fault.<br/><br/>That's interesting because it means that low stat doesn't mean you have to be bad at something, just that things go wrong more often. Someone with low Influence may be someone who can be influential, but has bad luck and something always go wrong when he negotiates. And you can't say in character "If it was me negotiating with the pirates instead of the Capitan, the Galactic Navy patrol cruiser wouldn't be here" because that's just something in the mechanics, but makes no sense whatsoever in fiction.<br/><br/>Same things happen with Assessments (or reads or discern realities or something), where fail probably means you now know something you didn't want to hear.<br/><br/>But that's something I'll have to think about more. I still feel like I'm missing something.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Now I also wonder how UW would work with cool, hard, hot, sharp and interface, but that's just me wondering, not suggestion for you to change anything <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I seem to have a crush on AW mechanics.\n<blockquote>Artificial Origin: As I mentioned earlier, in this thread, I love the Artificial Origin, but I feel that it would have to bend the rules to do the archetype justice.

There are three levels of Psionics, first level that affects just your own brain (like rain man computation, knowing someone is watching you or perfect memory), second level that affects other minds (like knowing there's a thinking being nearby, psyching assault or sharing of memories and skills) and third level (RAW NPC only) that can do physical effects or things that telepaths get to do only in the movies, like memory traps or something. That would work nicely with "how powerful you want psionics to be in your game".<br/><br/>I know you put this back until rest is finished, just an idea <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Run Program: The old \u2018use computer\u2019 Move was fun, but not especially useful.

Some of the moves depend on other moves in non-trivial way, no?<br/><br/>For example, you can command computer using the Interface move. But you can't make it do something and then shut down, or make something repeat infinitely, because that requires one move from Technocrat. When you're making acquisition, you can buy anything ... but political favor or VIP access, because that requires the Bribe move.<br/><br/>I would propose changing this somehow, because those are things that you would guess are part of the basic moves, and only then you learn they aren't (or possibly are, but then the extending moves don't make sense).<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to change the Technocrat move, the Bribe can just become "Greasing the Wheels" and give discount for buying those things. I'm not sure why buying VIP access or political favor should not possible for normal characters anyway. Discount would mean you can get those things more easily, and that fits into my idea "trader with something more" well I think.<br/><br/>Also, can I hack computer using Face Adversity with Interface? Sure, the Hacking move is better (it gives me free action in case I get 10+) but do I need it, or is it an upgrade like with the upgrades to Patch Up and Acquisition? That should maybe get written somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436799/#Comment_436799" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-09T21:36:00+00:00" title="August  9, 2014  9:36PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2014 9:46PM by Gwathdring.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, Apocalypse Engine is weird in one way -- the failure may be rather decoupled from the person failing.

It means that things already established come to fruition. That where otherwise you would establish possibility and ask or escalate a situation and ask or just ask provocatively ... instead you instead create something explicit and make some permanent change that follows from the fiction established.<br/><br/>Incautiously throwing in one more patrol because you want to represent "failing" the roll on a miss can be just as awkward as causing the player to fail at the task at which they most excel at an inappropriate moment to represent the failure of the roll in a game like DnD; Apocalypse Engine gives us the tools (and indeed requires that we use the tools) to determine what is and is not a fictionally appropriate moment, but it does it like so: make as hard a move <i>as you like.</i> It doesn't mean something goes wrong, then, but that something irrevocable happens. Something that can't be undone. Permanent marker stuff. It can be good or bad, big or small or something in between; afterall if you're a fan of the players sometimes you don't <i>like</i> to make the hardest move you <i>can</i> or even a move that's all that hard.<br/><br/>Having a high stat means you get to choose more options, exact more narrative control, and get what you want on your terms more of the time within the bounds of the moves you have available to you. But it also means you have a high stat; it's a statement about your character and the moves are statements about how characters like yours get on in the setting. Having a character with a high Sharp means something on it's own; the moves then tell you what the world does to and for people with high (or low) Sharp. The fictional/mechanical disconnect is there, I suppose, but I feel like you're exposing it more by skipping that middle step.<br/><br/>Why is that Galactic Navy patrol cruiser showing up, again?<br/><br/>Jon Harper put it really nicely somewhere. Aha!\n<blockquote>I've seen people struggle with hard moves in the moment. Like, when the dice miss, the MC stares at it like, "Crap! Now I have to invent something! Better make it dangerous and cool! Uh... some ninja... drop out of the ceiling... with poison knives! Grah!"<br/><br/>Don't do that. Instead, when it's time for a hard move, look back at the setup move(s) you made. What was threatened? What was about to happen, before the PC took action? Follow through on that. Bring the effects on screen. Bring the consequences to fruition.<br/><br/>And speaking of consequences, a hard move doesn't automatically equate to severe consequences. The severity of the threat is a separate issue, depending wholly on the fiction as established. The hard move means the consequences, large or small, take full effect now.<br/><br/>It's not about being mean, or punishing a missed roll, or inventing new trouble. It's about giving the fiction its full expression. Setup, follow-through. Action, consequences.</blockquote>\nI'm sure you're plenty familiar with this sort of idea in the game, but I bring it up here (in my meandering way, sorry <img alt=":\\" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":\\"/> ) because it pertains to stats high and low and what missing means. Missing doesn't require punishment, doesn't require things to go wrong. Nor does a low stat.

Only if you're more interested in exacting control over the fiction than following through on the clear opportunity. Maybe you don't mind missing the roll, and want to take the chance. Maybe the fiction is stacked in your favor sufficiently and the MC would have to really stretch to make that -1 seem threatening in this scene, right here, right now (of course, maybe Danvers makes a move against your territory near the lake while you're busy here in town but that's neither here nor there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RainbowSommelier" title="RainbowSommelier"><img alt="RainbowSommelier" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/227/nP4IQP04NLGH1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RainbowSommelier">RainbowSommelier</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437510/#Comment_437510" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-19T09:35:00+00:00" title="August 19, 2014  9:35AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm sure you're plenty familiar with this sort of idea in the game, but I bring it up here (in my meandering way, sorry <img alt=":\\" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":\\"/> ) because it pertains to stats high and low and what missing means.

But it isn't always and even when it is, the MC <i>is</i> a fan of your characters.</blockquote>\nYou're right. It is an excellent advice, and thinking about it, maybe I knew at one time, but looking at my games in the past, I'm not sure I always did things that way. Maybe it is a flaw in Dungeon World that it requires rolls (because everyone calls moves, I don't think you can "say yes or roll") and gives XP for fails, so it kind of pressures me to be as mean as possible. Maybe it's flaw in Dungeon World because it gives moves that are hard to make fails for (Discern Realities: "look around" x Read a Sitch: "look around in charged situation", Spout Lore: "think about something" x  Open you Brain to the Psychic Maelstrom).<br/><br/>Most likely it is just flaw in me and the way I do games, though. <br/><br/>There's one more principle that kind of goes against this. I like mapping randomness/luck in real world to randomness/luck in fiction. It kind of seems more fair. The player didn't do anything wrong to roll 6. He didn't make a mistake. So I don't like describing that the character did something wrong or made a mistake.<br/><br/>But this way of thinking leads to galactic navy that appears when you fail talking to pirates, so you're right that it needs restraint and more thinking about the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437521/#Comment_437521" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-19T15:50:47+00:00" title="August 19, 2014  3:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2014 4:23PM by Gwathdring.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

Most moves won\u2019t say what happens on a 6-, that\u2019s up to the GM but you also always mark XP."</blockquote>\nThat said, failing an observational type action can mean you choose which question you answer; throw them useful information, but they don't get to pick the question; you tell them what honesty demands--you're not trying to trick or trap them. You're giving them something genuinely useful ... but not on their terms and they probably won't like what they find out.<br/><br/>The galactic navy can also totally show up if that's something that flows with the established fiction. I feel like Read a Situtation should probably always let the player ask at least one question even on a miss, and you should tie the revelation of your hard move into that action even though you're not doing it through failure. Make your move, and misdirect.<br/><br/>The player fails their Read a Situation roll. So you let them ask a question and while they pick one you're thinking "What are my fronts doing? What are my NPCs doing? What tension exists in my PC-NPC triangles? What have the players not been dealing with? What setup moves have I made recently that the players haven't responded to?"<br/><br/>If you still come up with nothing ... well, you probably need to do more setup moves in the future and apply more pressure from your fronts!<br/><br/>But if the Galactic Navy has a reason to be here that follows from the fiction? Is there a warrant out for their arrest? Did they screw a bully in the GN with pull enough to use it for his dirty work? Both? Now is as good a time as any, right? But you want to misdirect--weigh your options. How hard a move do you want to make? Maybe you get lucky and they ask "What's my greatest threat?" Opportunity on a friggin' platter. Maybe you answer differently or you answer their question about something else ... but you still proceed after combining their expertise, local knowledge and sensor systems to misdirect in answering their question: "While you're examining the sensor readouts, you hear a message coming in over coms. It's a bit garbled (their ship has [Poor Wiring]), though you catch something about a GN Cruiser and the word warrant. Chessa, you're pretty sure the voice is Boris--maybe he's coming through for you after all; you might want more information if you can get the coms to cooperate."<br/><br/>You're thinking offscreen--the Navy knows they're here and is approaching but they have some time to avoid direct confrontation. You're making as hard a move as you like--it's not right on top of them because that doesn't flow nicely, but it's still making their day worse and you misdirected. They asked for information about their surroundings ... they got more than they bargained for, but in a way they're actually getting the drop on their enemy. Depending on the context that might be a bit of a soft move ... how is that irrevocable? Well, you're thinking offscreen--it's not just a GN cruiser, is it? Its worse than that, in the bigger picture. They're cornered and hemmed in. The GN knows where they are and has good, reliable leads on where they're going next. They can't run for long and they can hide for only barely longer and that's IF they don't do something really stupid AND they hit the dirt FAST. You're also making this otherwise soft-ish move potentially rougher than it looks--Chessa doesn't trust Boris any further than she can throw him and he's pretty hard to throw; he does owe him and he's on the level here and you're not *trying* to mislead them and trap them (you'll tell them what honesty demands), but if Chessa's player runs with it and seems to enjoy distrusting Boris, you've made the day that much more interesting!<br/><br/><br/>It's not the best example at all, but it's an example of how even the "I must make something bad happen, but there isn't anything bad that can happen here and now" sort of thing can work out.<br/><br/>If you're doing your job, the fiction is just WAITING for an opportunity to get all up in the player's faces. mess with their stuff, call in their debts, and so forth. When they miss that roll talking to the Pirates ... what do the Pirates want from them that this negotiation is holding at bay? What would the pilots be doing if the players weren't trying to assert themselves? And even failing that, you're thinking offscreen, you're thinking in time and space. What is going on while they're talking to the pirates? What was going on since the last time we checked in on these NPCs and these fronts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437541/#Comment_437541" name="Item_212" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T07:22:17+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  7:22AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I occasionally use 6- just as "the GM gets to make a Move with their characters/pieces". Because it's the only time the GM is allowed to act without the players. Obviously, the GM has to stay within the confines of the established fiction thus far (just like the players) but it at least gives the option to interrupt a player action to add a new element to the scene. From a writing/pacing point of view, this is important. It allows the GM to throw curve-balls without seeming entirely arbitrary.<br/><br/>Speaking of Read a Situation, I'd like to ask those that have playtested: have the Codex Entries come up? Have the players used Assessment much, or at all? I feel I overshot with the Assessment design; the old version was a "ask the Gm a question" which was used too frequently (I had a similar problem with DW's Discern Reality and Spout Lore). But now I fear it may be too much narrative investment to make an Assessment, and that the rewards of doing so are nebulous. I'd appreciate any feedback/suggestions while I mull over how to rewrite it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437544/#Comment_437544" name="Item_213" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T09:46:50+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  9:46AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2014 9:51AM by Gwathdring.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM should be getting to do that during normal play, too when golden opportunities arise and also even with soft-moves.

As long as you spend part of your downtime educating yourself about the subject of one of your Data Points, the Data Points of that subject do not expire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437616/#Comment_437616" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-21T22:52:39+00:00" title="August 21, 2014 10:52PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Data Point is much, much better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437719/#Comment_437719" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T13:50:21+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  1:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick update on the 0.83, which I should hopefully publish this week.

Ow! That was a painful month, followed by two weeks of sickness due to the aforementioned month of overtime. Aaaanywho, I'm back in the saddle, writing away under the effect of cold and flu medication. Also: My wife and I are expecting our first child in May! I'm gonna be a dad! It is now a race to see which of us will finish out 'Project' first. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Anywho, on with the update:<br/><br/>Right now I'm revisiting the Commerce section of the rules, specifically Cargo. <br/>- Firstly, all Cargo will be referred to as being Grade 0 to Grade 4. (I've been doing a pass, unifying the code-words in the rules, and 'Grade' will now be used to describe an object's relative value/power/upgrades; A Grade 1 weapon has 1 upgrade, etc. So Grade 2 cargo is much more valuable than Grade 1, while Grade 4 are the top-notch, best quality goods). <br/>- Secondly, whenever a unit of foreign cargo is brought to a new market, it can be bartered away for higher Grade local cargo. <br/>- Thirdly, Cargo can be used to give +Cargo Grade to an Aquisition roll, or once a Cargo hits Grade 4, it has the chance of catching the eye of a Faction, and can be gifted to gain a Favor with said Faction (or repay a Debt).<br/><br/>However, before I start expanding on that system, I'm looking for a general opinion about Interstellar Commerce in Space Opera games. How important is it, especially in a Powered By The Apocalypse system? How 'in depth' should it be, and how much rules overhead should be spent in fleshing it out? Should instead I simplify what I described up there even further?<br/><br/>On the one hand, it provides extra rewards for the players to seek, and a robust system of import/export (want/need) can flesh out the web of interplanetary relationships. A proper system of planetary surplus and demand, combined with a Type for each cargo (Industrial, Medical, Scientific, Luxury, etc) might encourage groups of players, giving them a solid short-term objective or a reason to go to X planet or make a stop at Y station or even land on Z hostile, uninhabited planet.<br/><br/>On the other hand, my experience with Traveller, while fun, was a bit closer to EVE Online than it was Mass Effect, if you get my meaning. It was hilarious to have the ship's Broker player pull up his honest-to-God spreadsheet with planetary surplus and demand when determining their next stop, but it certainly didn't make for action-packed sessions (except on one Rich, High-Tech planet, where the stock market was turned into an endurance-based virtual reality ESport.)<br/><br/>Thoughts/comments/opinions appreciated!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440363/#Comment_440363" name="Item_229" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-22T16:15:47+00:00" title="November 22, 2014  4:15PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a side note, I'm looking for a freelance illustrator/concept artist who can put together <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=spaceship+concept+art&amp;rlz=1C2ASUM_enCA503CA504&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1075&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gbJwVMf9I5CrogTRpIL4Bg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#imgdii=_" rel="nofollow">stuff like this</a>.

Back in the day I had a "Why are you on this ship" question as part of character creation, but ultimately did away with it because it felt a bit artificial. This could be an interesting alternative.<br/><br/>However, after doing a major overhaul of the Debt and Favor system, I've eliminated individual Debt and instead made it a group-wide Debt. As far as the subsequent playtests are concerned, it's worked spectacularly for abstracting the system. Something like a personal financial profile sadly would run counter to that change.<br/><br/>Not saying it's a bad idea at all. It's actually quite interesting, a very good jumping point for a commercial game. However, general feedback I've been getting from other places has kinda been skewed towards abstraction over detail, so I probably won't be adding to the Cargo system (not to say that I won't be tweaking and refining the rules;I'm still not 100% happy with their implementation, I think I can tighten them up some more).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440371/#Comment_440371" name="Item_232" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-22T23:33:18+00:00" title="November 22, 2014 11:33PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://juanochoascrapbook.blogspot.ca/" rel="nofollow">Juan Ochoa</a> maybe?

Contacted Juan, getting some artwork done by him. Hopefully if the eventual Kickstarter goes through, I'll be able to get some more work done, give the project a nice, professional PnP book look.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>General Update:<br/><br/>Currently working on the starship rules in detail, including the player's starting ship, ship sizes/capabilities, and ship-to-ship (and ship-vs-hazard) encounters. Of course, there's the elephant in the room that I'm studiously trying to avoid looking at, which is actually putting the basic gameplay into text. I mean, <i>I</i> know how a Powered By The Apocalypse game is supposed to work, but I really have to sit down and frame it in the context of Uncharted Worlds.<br/><br/>It seems petty, but I'm seriously waffling between the word 'Grade' and the word 'Class' to describe the relative value/power/superiority of an subject. I started with Grade, because it described how many upgrades a weapon had (a Grade 2 weapon has 2 upgrades). However, in normal conversations, my playtest groups and I found the word 'Class' felt better on the tongue. "You can't take on a Class 3 starship with just a Class 2, unless you've got a significant advantage" or "It'll be easy to find a market for this Class 3 cargo". Thoughts?<br/><br/>Finally, since I'm thinking about art, I've also been considering layout and such. Now, the current document has a layout of sorts; not amazing, but workable enough. 2 pages per Career, 1 page per Origin, etc. However, I realize that if I want to make this a proper print document, I'd have to really up the font size to something legible. Plus the margins are narrow. 9 point font and narrow margins might work for an e-document, but on printed page it looks really cramped. So I did a test, upping the font size to a more manageable 11 and giving regular margins... Iiiiii'm gonna need to redo the whole layout of this damn thing, piece by piece, re-examining how things are arranged, because that breaks <i>everything</i>. *weeps*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440529/#Comment_440529" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-27T02:13:40+00:00" title="November 27, 2014  2:13AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I like "Class"!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440531/#Comment_440531" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-27T03:27:00+00:00" title="November 27, 2014  3:27AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you thought writing a game that works when you play it was the hard part?

Naming them feels like it's giving at least a small connotation to their function and/or design. Instead, I'd rather leave it just number based (Class 1 to Class 4) and have the more evocative names be used as shorthand for the ship's purpose/capibilities. Also, the Faction that built that ship type will have a big impact on the naming convention of the design; what one calls a Dreadnought, another faction would call a God-Hand or a Purifier. Since the Factions are player-created and unique to each game, I'd rather leave the flavor-naming of ship Class as hands-off as possible.<br/><br/>That said, looks like Class is a uniform winner of the Class/Grade question, heh                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440733/#Comment_440733" name="Item_238" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-08T19:32:30+00:00" title="December  8, 2014  7:32PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2014 7:32PM by Archangel3d.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, it's hard to know exactly who I'm writing for anymore.

I hope to have news about the kickstarter very soon. (unfortunate delays, including influenza followed by bronchitis, have made it... difficult to film a Kickstarter video :P ). Have you had a chance to take an early version for a test spin yet?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>General update:<br/>Hard at work on making a more presentable version of the rules, with proper font and stuff. I'm quite happy with the way things are coming together. It might be a little kitschy, but I'm naming my chapters as if they were sectors of a space station. So the Injury and healing and Armor rules are in 'Sector 07 - Med-bay', the Faction creation, Debt, Favor and Standing rules are in 'Sector 06 - Embassy', etc.<br/><br/>I've run into an interesting dilemma concerning Moves. On the one hand, I feel like it would be good to have all the common Moves in one chapter, to make it easy to reference. On the other hand, individual chapters would certainly benefit from having the appropriate Moves right there, to avoid flipping back and forth (for example, the Acquisition Move in the chapter detailing weapons/equipment, the Brace for Impact Move in the section detailing injury rules, etc). I'm thinking that the Big List Of Moves might have go towards the end of the book as an Appendix chapter... but I worry that without them front-and-center, reading the book might be confusing.<br/><br/>On the other other hand (gasp! purge the mutant!), all the basic Moves will be referenced (in short form) on the reverse of every character sheet. Maybe that will be enough? Argh second-guessing myself. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441089/#Comment_441089" name="Item_243" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-30T23:25:18+00:00" title="December 30, 2014 11:25PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            List appropriate moves in the appropriate sections.

You'll make me blush. You've read through things a number of times, is there anything that stands out to you as "this should be fixed" or "this probably won't work and will need to be house-ruled"? Obviously some sections are unfinished or missing (*cough spaceship rules cough*) but overall things are pretty set, so this is the time when I would need important issues to be flagged. I wouldn't want to make a 4e Skill Challenges -style mistake.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>As for the Moves issue, I've taken the feedback into account (thank you all for your opinions, by the way) and I've restructured the table of contents to have an early chapter about Moves, which will explain each of them in slightly greater detail.<br/><br/>If anyone is interested, <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ky16XZasoPTkRINXo1eEtuTzg/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">here's a preview of the current Table of Contents</a></b>.

Of course, the storyteller is slapping him in the face and locking him back in the closet. I guess the one thing I'm a little confused about is how the career kits work. I don't know why, but it took me until now to realize that the Utility Gear loadout includes 3 career kits instead of 2. I think it's because the first one is listed in the line with the loadout's name.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is an issue for anyone else, but I'm likely to just pick the stat boost for my origin, because those are the only bonuses that you can't get during play. Even if you choose an origin with non-stat boost skills that don't match your chosen Careers' skills, you can get those skills in play by accomplishing other XP milestones.<br/><br/>Maybe make a single stat boost in available as an upgrade in your Career? It would only be available if you hadn't taken it at character creation. Say my character, Alamir, comes from a Hillbilly Background with the Lamplighter and Keypunch Operator Careers. He can choose a +1 Physique bonus, the Moonshiner Career's Bootlegging skill, the Dirt Farmer's Mullet-Growing skill or the Keypunch Operator's Being Obsolete skill from his Background. He chooses the Dirt Farmer's Mullet-Growing. Now say since he didn't take the stat boost, he can later take one (but not both) stat boosts available from the Keypunch Operator or Lamplighter Careers. He decides that he'd rather have a boost to Interface (available to Keypunch Operators).<br/><br/>Having a stat boost available in every career will make the other Origin skills more attractive. And now players could wait and see which stats they need a boost in and then take the boost in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441109/#Comment_441109" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-01T04:31:11+00:00" title="January  1, 2015  4:31AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and as for the name of the Quarantine Section, maybe you could take a cue from Star Trek and call it Stellar Cartography?

class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, the munchkin in me wants there to be a way to add infinite upgrades to my shuttle. </blockquote>\nHehe, yeah, after a lot of playtesting on that front, limiting all Assets to maximum Class 2, with possibly Class 3 with a Skill, made it a lot less Swiss-army-knife-esque. That said, there is potential for Class 4+ weapons, equipment, vehicles and potentially even crew when it comes to ancient alien technology and such. And some of the upgrades would be unique to the alien civ. You could probably have a whole story based around finding, keeping and maintaining a Class 5 "Shuttle" with Living (+Regeneration) and Intelligent (+Self Control) upgrades, somewhere between Moya from Farscape and Kitt from Knight Rider.\n<blockquote>I guess the one thing I'm a little confused about is how the career kits work. I don't know why, but it took me until now to realize that the Utility Gear loadout includes 3 career kits instead of 2. I think it's because the first one is listed in the line with the loadout's name.</blockquote>\nCareer Kits function a lot like "Adventuring Kits" from Dungeon World, full of just the right sci-fi gadget you need at the time. The main difference is that they are more or less unlimited, but they only have tools/gadgets appropriate for a specific career. They also affect the look and style of the character's clothing; if you want to stand out and look awesome, get a Personality Kit or Commercial Kit (or both!). If you want to go out in bad weather, get an Explorer's Kit. Kits were introduced recently, so I may not have written them up very well yet.<br/><br/>Good point about the Utility Gear; I'll be sure to make the base bonus clear when reformatting the layout of the various Assets (chances are the base bonus/abilities of the Weapons and Vehicles are similarly difficult to notice). \n<blockquote>I'm not sure if this is an issue for anyone else, but I'm likely to just pick the stat boost for my origin, because those are the only bonuses that you can't get during play. Even if you choose an origin with non-stat boost skills that don't match your chosen Careers' skills, you can get those skills in play by accomplishing other XP milestones.<br/><br/>Having a stat boost available in every career will make the other Origin skills more attractive. And now players could wait and see which stats they need a boost in and then take the boost in play.</blockquote>\nThis is a very interesting observation that comes up fairly often from self-avowed 'munchkins'. Back in the earlier versions of the game, the Origin only had a stat boost. However, when making characters, I got the comment that 'just one more skill' from another career would 'tie the character together'. Cross-career skills were added to each Origin in order to give the option to build your ideal character from the get-go. The trade off was not having the +1 in a stat.<br/><br/>Additionally, the way the milestone system works, if you have a skill in a career, it makes it much easier to earn a milestone in that same career simply by making use of the skill. In that regard, building towards a third career is easier for those who take a cross-career Origin skill. It's negligible, true, but it has come up in the longer campaign that I've run.<br/><br/>Finally, the idea of adding a +1 in a stat through milestones is one I've been toying with. I'd rather not have them in the Career, though. Instead, it may go into the Healing rules; Critical damage can be repaired with prosthesis, and if you "spend" Milestones, you can gain better-than-average cybernetic or surgical upgrades, effectively giving yourself +1 in a stat if you don't already have a stat increase. Or something, that still remains to be seen. Maybe it'll have to wait until the (tentative) [Alien/Psionic/Robot] expansion book, where Mutated and Cybernetic would be 'careers' you could gain Milestones in to boost your stats. Just spitballing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441119/#Comment_441119" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-01T20:32:58+00:00" title="January  1, 2015  8:32PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like where you're going with that.

I've gone and made minor or major tweaks to all 5 of the stat Moves, stuff that I didn't even know was bothering me until I actually started writing it out and was like "who thought this was a good idea... oh yeah... -_-"<br/><br/>The biggest change is the removal of the +Interface Move 'Program', replacing it with 'Access'. Basically, I felt that everything you could do with Program could be done with either Get Involved, Assessment or Face Adversity using +Interface on an open system. Instead, the new 'Access' Move is about getting past protections, encryption and other security. It's now less of a 'Command Computer' and more of a 'ICE Breaker'.<br/><br/>Anywho, as a bit of a sneak peak, I thought I'd post what I have so far for Chapter 03. I'd appreciate any comments and impressions about the mechanics/functionality of the Moves and readability of the sections, especially by folks who have seen older versions. I know it's a bit long to read, but I'd also like to know if the full description matches what you expected about the Move.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ky16XZasoPNXV1T01EOG1Ua1E/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><b>Preview of Sector 03 - Ops (Moves)</b></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441548/#Comment_441548" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-15T16:49:14+00:00" title="January 15, 2015  4:49PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2015 4:50PM by Archangel3d.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Had a great playtest last night, which really allowed me to get my hands dirty with the combat, and find what felt the most natural and fluid. What came of it was a fast-slowmo-fast style in 300 or Batman Arkham Asylum, jumping from one pivotal maneuver/attack/dodge to the next, speeding through the motion in between. The GM describes an enemy action and asks the character how they handle it. They follow up the player's answer with another action and asks again how they handle it. No rolling (the Open Fire or Launch Assault roll has already been made), just rapid-fire this then this then this.<br/><br/>In the case of partial successes, the GM can easily fold the consequences into that rapid-fire sequence, even prompting the character to fill in those details.\n<blockquote>Example: The character with a shotgun that fires explosive rounds (+Messy, +Property Damage) flanks a group of thugs holed up in a doorway. He rolls 9 for his Launch Assault as he charges them. I made the assumption that the character was going lethal (it's explosive shotgun shells, he doesn't have much choice here :P) I haven't quite made my choices as to the 7-9 consequences for partial success at the time of rolling, instead I let things flow and look for opportunities.<br/><br/><b>GM:</b> The first one turns and only has the chance to say "urk", how do you deal with him?<br/><b>Character: </b>"Urk" in this case translates to "where did my intestines go?" I shoot him in the gut.<br/><b>GM: </b>The explosion almost tears him in half, spraying viscera. The second thug turns and fires his own scattershot wildly, blowing out the lights*. He pumps his shotgun again, but before gets a shot off...<br/><b>Character:</b> His head gets blown off.<br/><b>GM: </b>The body hits the bloody metal floorplates.

The size of the groups can differ, based on how challenging the GM wants to make the encounter. If I had, say 6 thugs, I could make an easy encounter with a single group of 6, harder with 2 groups of 3, have a special character in one group alone (because they're more awesome/better equipped) and a second group of 5 goons, etc. Groups can also be divided by location (one coming from the east, the other coming from the west) because they can't be engaged at the same time.<br/><br/>(I go into this in the Chapter 3 preview of the move (posted previously) and will go into more detail on how to run combat encounters in the GMing section)<br/><br/>In this case I had a group of 3 shotgunners who took cover in a doorway. There were other groups in this fight; a pair of riflemen on a balcony below the character's platform, and a gang of 4 thugs with pistols and combat knives coming in on a gantry above them. The other characters were dealing with their own targets (the Scientist dropping a cryo grenade in on the riflemen, the Pilot using his rapid fire (+Area) SMG to suppress and drive back the group coming from above.)<br/><br/>The Soldier of the group (the dude with the explosive shotgun) decided to take on the gang holding the door. He didn't want to charge head-on (because that would be suicidal), so he kept low and used stealth to access another door that joined back up with the room they were bunkered in. (Face Adversity +Mettle (overcome opposition using stealth)). Once in, he charged them, shotgun blazing. I called him to roll Launch Assault (roll+Physique, because it was a physical, close-quarters charge). A success (partial in this case) allows him to choose the fate of the group he engaged, based on his description of how he was going into the fight. In this case, guns blazing with an explosive shotgun really had only "dead' and "maimed" as options.<br/><br/>Open Fire and Launch Assault are used in lieu of a dozen attack rolls, damage rolls and dodge rolls. If a single shot or strike would end the encounter (sniper round, mortar shot, knife in the back), then it's a discrete Face Adversity. When faced with a complicated combat encounter, rolling Open Fire/Launch Assault once per engagement/exchange and then doing a back-and-forth description of that outcome ended up working really well.<br/><br/>I should point out that I chose not to harm the character despite his partial success; "suffer harm" is usually the top consequence of a partially successful or failed Open Fire/Launch Assault. But, in this case, because he had the advantage of surprise (successful stealthy maneuver to set up the attack) I didn't bring the full power of the consequences to bare. Had he tried the same tactic while charging straight at the door, I would have definitely shotgunned him for a severe injury as part of his consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441558/#Comment_441558" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-15T22:06:56+00:00" title="January 15, 2015 10:06PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2015 10:08PM by Johnstone.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, no I think I get most of that (even just from the example), and I noticed that you were aiming for a one-roll resolution from fights from the rules.\n<blockquote>Once in, he charged them, shotgun blazing. I called him to roll Launch Assault (roll+Physique, because it was a physical, close-quarters charge).</blockquote>\nThis is the part I was asking about. One of the things that sort-of strikes me as a big feature of AW moves-style resolution is that the player describes a fictional action (or reaction to a situation) and then the particular move is decided based on that. Of course, Vincent also says the option of stating the move and then describing how the character makes it is also good. But it still feels very much like a system where we describe stuff that happens until we get to a question about the outcome, roll for it, and go straight to the outcome.<br/><br/>It seems to me, in this example, that you are pushing the part where you roll more toward the beginning of the conversation (if that makes sense). Like, did the player say "okay, I assault them with my shotgun" or "I use the launch assault move now" and then make the roll? Or was there more description of the fiction than that?<br/><br/>Hmm. I don't feel like this is as clear as I intended it to be. In my normal AW games, we would have more of the example assault conversation before the roll, and the description after the roll would be "here's a choice, what do you do" and we would be back into free talking really quickly. It seems like (and maybe I'm wrong) you've gone for the roll pretty quickly, and then presented the choices dictated by the roll result as the focus of the conversation. As in: "I assault them with the shotgun," "okay, roll it, "I got a 7-9," "okay now let's talk about what that means in the fiction."<br/><br/>I'm not saying this is bad. I think it's an interesting choice. It reminds me of a lot of conflict resolution in games from the 00s. Probably plays well to making fights go faster, as well. If that's what you're going for and not just me being mistaken, though, I think you should try to be really, really clear that this is how you intend it to work, just because people will likely bring various other assumptions to your game when they play it (including stuff like my first paragraph after the quote in this post). Like, talking about how you group combatants together goes toward that, but even "6 guys = 1 roll" doesn't necessarily say where in the conversation the roll should happen.<br/><br/>Hopefully that made sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441559/#Comment_441559" name="Item_258" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-15T22:07:46+00:00" title="January 15, 2015 10:07PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2015 10:09PM by Johnstone.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            double post, damn these interface changes<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441569/#Comment_441569" name="Item_259" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-16T06:00:16+00:00" title="January 16, 2015  6:00AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It seems to me, in this example, that you are pushing the part where you roll more toward the beginning of the conversation (if that makes sense).

Yes indeed, the "resolution" is known from the beginning, and all the combat actions that would "trigger" during the following conversation simply refer back to the original result. It's a bit predictive/scripted in that sense; we know the rough outcome from the start, lets find out how we get from here to there.<br/><br/>So yes, the description of the fiction happens after the roll, which is triggered as combat is joined. This ended up with a pretty fluid back and forth without having to 'watch' for move triggers. It might be the wrong way 'round from what most folks are used to, but it ended up feeling very natural to me by the end of the session.<br/><br/>Your point about making that aspect clear is very noted; I've left myself a reminder in the outline of my GMing chapter with a link to that post, just so I don't forget.

Instead, I'm toying with the idea that any character can call in a Favor or go into Debt with a Faction to cancel or greatly diminish social, political or commercial costs and/or consequences of a Move.<br/><br/>Did your Command result in your crew getting arrested? Call in a Favor with the StarSec fleet and get that overturned. Did your Acquisition attempt end up too costly? Go into Debt with the RedStar Syndicate to get a loan (or put the squeeze on the seller).<br/><br/>Of course, having Debt still means the faction will be looking for you to repay them.<br/><br/>In this mode, Debt and Favor act like 'hero points/last-chance points/second wind'; a player-controlled alternate means of overcoming/mitigating certain consequences (within reason; the Faction they call upon still has to be appropriate to the consequence and currently operating in that sector. Also if the character's standing is too low, there's a good chance the Faction won't touch the case.) It further removes Debt and Favor as a currency.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441632/#Comment_441632" name="Item_262" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-17T23:50:38+00:00" title="January 17, 2015 11:50PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2015 11:51PM by Johnstone.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it's "more like hero points," I imagine it would go like this:<br/><br/>You flub a roll, wind up with some kind of scandal.

Earlier I had advocated making the "+1 to X" ability selectable after character creation. I think a better option would be to have a second unique ability. Right now I'm making a "party" of five characters, where nobody has an overlapping career or background. There's still going to be some overlap unless I pick the "+1 to X" ability. Putting another unique ability into each background would take some work, but the yield in in extra options would be tremendous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441752/#Comment_441752" name="Item_267" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T13:35:00+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  1:35PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooooh <i>solo</i>, sorry, confused it with one-on-one (running for one person). My bad. That one I have done. Still feedback is welcome :P<br/><br/>Remember that just because a character has 2 careers, doesn't mean they get all 10 skills within those careers. In fact two characters can have the same origin and career and have very different thematic builds without overlap at all. With 1 skill from their Origin and 3 skills divided between their two Careers, it's very likely that there won't be any significant skill overlap. Also, most skills are designed to be able to function in multiples (or at least not interfere with each other), should two characters have the same skill.<br/><br/>I actually agree that having the [+1 Stat] as an Origin-only skill causes some issues (players encouraged to always take it), but I'm willing to live with that offset. However I'm <i>very</i> reticent to add unique skills as well. Not just for the amount of work involved, but also because by their very nature they would be skills that the characters could not ever work towards earning, and thus must be limited in usefulness to the point of being esoteric.<br/><br/>I'll have to ask my math-brain playtester for his numbers again, but he calculated that currently there are something like 2592000 character combinations possible using Origin + Career + Career + 1 out of 4 origin skills + 3 out of 10 career skills. (Obviously, there <i>is</i> overlap in that particular number, but thematically two similar skill choices from two different origin/career combinations can yield two very different archetypes)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441781/#Comment_441781" name="Item_268" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T18:55:18+00:00" title="January 20, 2015  6:55PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to use the excellent <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/118337/Star-Trader?term=star+trader&amp;affiliate_id=319435" rel="nofollow"><i>Star Trader</i> supplement</a> from Zozer Games.

Pruning the wording, rephrasing them, and sometimes overhauling them to fit the new basic Moves is very satisfying.<br/><br/>For example, the old and slightly clunky Assassination:\n<blockquote><b>Assassination</b><br/>When you want a lightly guarded or unsuspecting NPC out of the picture, describe how you arrange their death and Roll+Mettle. <br/>On a hit, they\u2019re dead, and no one knows it was you. On a 7-9, they\u2019re dead, but there may be evidence linking it to you. <br/></blockquote>\nIt honestly didn't need to be a custom Move when it's basically just a restricted Face Adversity. Instead, I went for something broader that can affect a lot more situations, while being more succinct.\n<blockquote><b>Assassination</b><br/>Any successful (10+) Move that results in someone\u2019s death also leaves no evidence that you committed the act.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442457/#Comment_442457" name="Item_285" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-04T18:39:07+00:00" title="February  4, 2015  6:39PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2015 6:39PM by Archangel3d.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still working my way through the Careers, pruning heavily.
