I'll even provide a link! Please navigate to <a href="http://stores.lulu.com/ndpdesign" rel="nofollow">my lulu.com storefront</a> in order to purchase.<br/><br/>The Interim Edition of Annalise is a 66-page perfectbound 9\xd77 landscape book. It comes in 4 flavors: there are two covers (red or white), and your choice of grayscale interior for $20.00 or full-color interior for $25.00. This edition of the game contains none of the fiction or art that was in the Unbidden Guests Edition released at Gen Con, but the game text is exactly the same. All of the fiction and art that has been made public so far for the game is available for download from <a href="http://www.findannalise.com" rel="nofollow">the website</a>.<br/><br/>The Eternal Tears PDF edition is also available for <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/annalise-eternal-tears-pdf-edition/6012930" rel="nofollow">purchase from lulu</a>.<br/><br/>Many thanks to everyone who has bought and played the game so far, and my most humble apologies for the egregious delay in making a print edition available.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198598/#Comment_198598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-24T14:39:20+00:00" title="March 24, 2009  2:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah yes, I knew I forgot something.<br/><br/>So, if this is the "Interim edition", then what is planned for the future?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
