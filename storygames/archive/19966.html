In the end, I realized that they were pretty much the same. Neither really tells you how to prep and run the game (Everway and Fudge come the closest, but are mostly about adjucating specific situations, which is helpful/necessary but not enough). All five of them are about creating characters but have not much on how to create and run the actual game.<br/><br/>Some post-Forge games were very different and they usually worked (love Fiasco) but I never got the hang of how traditional roleplaying games should work.<br/><br/>This is also why I thought "A Primer for Old-School Gaming" missed the mark at first. It was talking about adjudicating specific situations and it says pretty much the same things as Everway did and I was unaware just how codified late 3.5 and it's twin children 4e and PF had become. "More bike paint" I thought.<br/><br/>Then the OSR happened and I started by reading Dark Dungeons and Labyrinth Lord -- still mostly bikepaint (character rules, combat rules), even if a few things in there like the concept of a "turn" in the dungeon with strong consequences for torches etc were interesting -- then I read Moldvay or Mentzer (not sure which) and to me, that was a jaw-dropping experience. One of the most well-knows RPG books in existence but I had been missing out for all of my life. Here was a book that clearly said how to prep and run the dungeons! This was the missing puzzle piece. To find this in my thirties\u2026 so many lost years.<br/><br/>All of those 90:s games were so vague on this. I guess because they were already familiar with how to prep and run D&amp;D. They had drifted it beyond recognition (in pursuit of telling stories) but weren't clear on where they'd landed. Yet they billed themselves as explanatory "What is a roleplaying game".<br/><br/>I tell variants of this story, my journey through RPGs, all the time.

I wrote it in a way that all traditional roleplaying games have been written.\n<blockquote>All of those 90:s games were so vague on this. I guess because they were already familiar with how to prep and run D&amp;D. They had drifted it beyond recognition (in pursuit of telling stories) but weren't clear on where they'd landed. Yet they billed themselves as explanatory "What is a roleplaying game".</blockquote>\nIn my opinion, a well written roleplaying game shouldn't need "What is a roleplaying game" but instead the reader should understand what it is by reading the game. Now, take the time and think about how this can be done.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Should you convey how the game should be played in the Character Generation chapter, or the Combat chapter that should have this? Should it be the Game Master Chapter that tells how to write an adventure?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Take your time and think about this before you read on.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Because if you thought in the lines of the questions, you had the wrong perspective. A game should only tell you how it should be played, and every additional part should add to that. Almost no roleplaying games focus on this. Instead, it's a bunch of bikepaints. Think about how roleplaying game books are structured. They either start with character generation or the world, but that doesn't mean anything unless you know how they are used during play.<br/><br/>The closest thing I can find to a structure of play is how to write an adventure, but it doesn't say anything about how a session should be run. Games like <b>Mouse Guard</b> explains it, but you have to figure it out by yourself by jumping around to different parts of the book.<br/><br/>Focus on explaining how to play the game. Write a structure of play, which describes the procedures and processes that the group has to go through to reach the end of the game.<br/><br/>I did that with <i>This is Pulp</i>. It's basically played out the same way as Matin\xe9, but it's only three pages long. My first iteration was bad, because my external playtester didn't grasp how the game should be played: he brought a lot of his established conventions of how a roleplaying game should be played. I realized that I had to learn a new way of writing a roleplaying game if I wanted to present a structure of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441475/#Comment_441475" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T11:27:35+00:00" title="January 14, 2015 11:27AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Should it be the Game Master Chapter that tells how to write an adventure?

This is what I meant in my OP here.\n<blockquote>Games like <b>Mouse Guard</b> explains it, but you have to figure it out by yourself by jumping around to different parts of the book.</blockquote>\nMouse Guard and Burning Empires both do this, yes. But so does the old Basic D&amp;D, which I was surprised by.<br/>And I think MG/BE/TB explains how <em>they</em> are played but a lot of the assumptions in traditional games (whether the games embraced or went against those assumptions) come from D&amp;D\u2019s place-based structure rather than from the linear path of conflicts in Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>You know from before, Rickard, that I am very bitter at Drakar och Demoner 91 because it was the first game I read and it set me upon a path that in the end was a unsatisfying game experience.<br/>Ironically, all three preceding editions outline the procedures of prep (if not play), a decent guide to how to build a game world. This was lost in the 1991 edition.\n<blockquote>Focus on explaining how to play the game.

The specifics of the surface mechanics (what dice to use etc) are the \u201cpaint color for the bikeshed outside the powerplant\u201d. Somewhere in between are some very important choices (that are often left implicit).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441479/#Comment_441479" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T13:23:58+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  1:23PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What you guys are saying makes perfect sense if as a designer one of your goals is to teach newcomers how to RPG, or if your game brings such new concepts to gaming that no one has ever seen them before.  It makes less sense if your rules are written for experienced hobbyists who already understand the intention and application, or ditto (for trad games) if you assume that the GM is an autonomous individual who will determine their own way of using the tools you have provided.  This is why Rickard was closer to the mark in an earlier conversation where he said rulebooks are toolkits.<br/><br/>Sure, some may be more than merely a box of tools.  Some toolkits may choose to include a tutorial DVD.  Some don't.  But what they all have in common is <i>they contain tools.</i>  That is their primary property; the minimum requirement for inclusion in the definition.  Mechanics aren't surface.  They are literally essential to ("the core essence of") anything that happens once the system gets into human hands.<br/><br/>By way of analogy: Theatrical Scripts don't include instructions about "How to project your voice", "What the Director's job is" or "What 'stage-left' means".  Automobile manuals do not include instructions on "How to sit in this car" or "When to accelerate" or "Who goes first at 4-way stop signs".<br/><br/>People can bikeshed about anything, mechanics included.  But before anyone picks up the dice it is the way your mechanics work, the shapes and properties of your tools - not the style of your tutorial or instruction manual - that distinguishes your system (product) from other systems (products) in the marketplace.  That's non-trivial (at least until capitalism has ended).  After they pick up the dice, what happens at the table has as much to do with the players as it does with your rules.<br/><br/>I can already imagine some people responding as though I'm speaking normatively.  I'm not.  I'm speaking anti-categorically.  And I'm certainly not saying that one should necessarily <i>avoid</i> writing the kind of texts you're speaking of.  I'm simply pointing out that you cannot say "what game rules should do" and assume that they all have the same purposes, components, intentions, markets, or requirements.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441480/#Comment_441480" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T14:00:17+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  2:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The instruction/tutorial is a big part of what I'm saying -- because I missed out on it for twenty years! despite games billing themselves as starter games -- but not the <em>only</em> part.

As you know, I based <b>Matin\xe9</b> off Drakar och Demoner (1991 is the 4th one), and when I later analyzed adventure writing, I had to go back as long as the one from 1985 (2nd ED) to find how to write an adventure. On the Swedish market, Drakar och Demoner was like <b>D&amp;D</b> (d20) was in the US, but based off <b>RuneQuest </b>(BRP). What's interesting is that the game left out these important parts, which meant that roleplaying games were written for roleplaying gamers, and making it harder for newcomers to enter the stage.<br/><br/>I can even go so far to say that this is one of the reasons of why roleplaying games became less popular.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I will check out Moldvay and Mentzer.

Greyhawk and Blackmoor were big on "You can try ANYTHING" as a distinguishing characteristc from Chainmail and contemporary wargames with Stats. And. Tables. For. Every. Goddamned. Thing. Just one (two?) year earlier, "D&amp;D" was not much more than rules for fighting with weird fantasy races and monsters using already-existing tabletop systems, and rules for advancement (itself not a D&amp;D innovation, but a carryover from some even earlier wargame that I can't recall ATM).<br/><br/>It was a LONG time (maybe not even reached today, in the mainstream!) before coherent procedures for play *outside of combat* came into existence. In that gap, most of the games you listed were born. Heavy, heavy focus on systems for simulation, without any real mention of getting started, sustaining play, focusing on the fun over the minutiae, knowing when to wrap up ("RPGs are neverending stories!" hah--hardly!). And that ever-present notion that "the GM will figure out how to rule fairly, for anything not in these rules." (hah! I say again)<br/><br/>Summary: if one can "try anything" how does one write rules to cover it all? Heck, even Blackmoor was more a pile of Arneson's rulings and hastily ginned-up resolution systems, with some history and principle NPC info thrown in for seasoning. NO ONE knew how to run it except him; everyone else was faking it (just like him!).<br/><br/>One could even argue that The Forge Phenom was the first serious analysis of procedures of play, focus, and criticism to evolve the experience of play from "four hours of play for twenty minutes of fun" (IIR the numbers correctly). The first smart step towards that was figuring out what system did, when, and how and then ask, "OK, why? Sacred Cow or Critical Component?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441507/#Comment_441507" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T22:09:37+00:00" title="January 14, 2015 10:09PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I get uncomfortable when a game forces me into its flow rather than rather than leaving me room to create my own.
