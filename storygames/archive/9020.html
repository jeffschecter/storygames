I don't know how Story Games come across if the first exposure is reading one. My first experience was playing PTA and I think if I had read it I wouldn't have bought into it and would have convinced myself that it wasn't for me. But, of course, I can't know that for sure.<br/><br/>Did anyone here start out reading a Story Game without playing first? What was that like?</blockquote>\nAnd here's hansel's response:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hansel</cite>I'd read numerous indie games before I ever played one. In fact, I'd read the D&amp;D 3.5 core books mostly cover to cover before I ever got a chance to play (run) the game, which was my first time.<br/><br/>Dogs and BW were my first two to read, and even with such a short experience with trad games, I knew, heart beating and palms sweaty, that<i>this</i>was what I wanted.</blockquote>\nSo that's two rather different first experiences! I'm definitely interested in hearing more.

One day, while talking about how I ran Call of Cthulhu's sanity mechanics with my FLGS owner, he pointed at the rack and said "There's this new game, Power Kill, from a weird independent publisher, that no one gets but maybe is perfect for you."  Power Kill is, of course, the B-side to Puppetland.  I read both games while walking from the store back to campus, and was totally reeled in, so I assembled a group about two hours later, and ran Puppetland.  I spent years looking for more of that, mostly without success.<br/><br/>Like many other people here, I see, my finding my way into the current crop of games started with Costikyan's enthusiastic recommendation of My Life With Master..  I have yet to play it, but at some level I don't feel like I need to.

I was getting sick of the tabletop games I'd been seeing circa 1995-2000.<br/><br/>But now that I think about the response, I'd been playing freeform games and incredibly rules light LARP games for a while before I started writing some of my own stuff. So maybe playing comes first...it's a bit chicken and egg.<br/><br/>One of the last things I started doing was reading the other products out there. Mostly because I simply didn't realise they existed until the early 2000s (and later), in fact many of them didn't exist when I first started getting the idea for new forms of generating a story through gameplay.<br/><br/>I honestly can't remember the first story game I read, but it was good to see that there were other people who were trying to plunge into new directions in roleplaying.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199370/#Comment_199370" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T17:31:23+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  5:31PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if The Window counts, but it did start to turn my mind to new ideas.

The real question here is what exactly counts as a Story Game?  My first experiences with RPGs included playing Shadowrun, then AD&amp;D.  At which point, I started looking into other sorts of games and came across things like The Window, and later Risus, both of which I've read but never actually had a chance to play.  At that point I just started reading as many games as I could, absorbing all sorts of styles from White Wolf to the Forge.  Throughout this I've played D&amp;D 3.5 and 4E, but I've always looked for a chance to try my hand at other games.<br/><br/>Only in the past year did I get to sit down and play my first indie game, and that was In a Wicked Age, with which I immediately fell in love.  I played it before I read it, though, and I think that's probably the best way to experience that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199381/#Comment_199381" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T19:08:44+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  7:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does playing and hacking Fudge a lot 10 years ago count?

I should have. Last thing I want to do here is engage in that debate. I have a pretty broad definition myself, but lots of people have their own definitions. I like the way the way everyone is defining it for themselves here. If I were to alter my definition to fit some of theirs, then I would say "writing" myself because of a few different things I was running at cons before I first played PTA. But for me it was that PTA experience that changed the way I played from there forward.<br/><br/>So to refine the question a bit, did your "Aha!" S-G moment come while reading a new game or playing one? (Of course, feel free to just answer the original question or respond to whatever you like.

If it doesn't, there's lots else to talk about here.<br/><br/>I think I had an "Aha!" moment the first time I played Settlers of Catan too.

The great dividing line - perfect! Did you read it or play it first?</blockquote>\nI read it first.  Then the books.  Then I tried to play it...with GURPS.  Wow that brings back memories, what was I thinking? B-)<br/><br/>On whim I went to Ambercon since I obviously didn't know what the heck I was doing and played and ran games.  It <br/>'clicked' then.   Went on to play Amber for the next 15 or so years.  <br/><br/>I only recently fell into the 'story games', mainly because I was have problems finding Amber players and want to get something else to draw players in (of course to hopefully play more Amber later, I'm such a geek).  <br/><br/>I've come to see some problems with Amber as written (they were always there I just worked around them) and interesting ideas in the 'story' design community.  I like these games now and will keep playing them into the forseeable future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199737/#Comment_199737" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T12:25:20+00:00" title="March 31, 2009 12:25PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing.
