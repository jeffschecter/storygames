This approach helps reduce a potential lack of clarity between how player role-playing and character social prowess interact together to affect the fiction, but comes with the caveat that some players may fair better than others for various reasons.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395930/#Comment_395930" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T14:00:34+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  2:00PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen this in some groups...in my own group there is 1..maybe 2 people for whom this would lead to them dominating the fiction.

Then it should be reflected in their stats, not simply to describe the benefit, but to assess the opportunity cost to their other stats.  In a lot of games, if you are letting someone who rps high charisma to benefit from their natural charisma but <i>also</i> from their character's high dexterity, strength, etc., then you've got a problem... unless they've paid for their natural benefit by purchasing high charisma through the game's mechanics.<br/><br/>Simply removing charisma as a stat doesn't solve anything; it just removes the possibility of a fix -- while implying that the game isn't about charisma even though actually it is.  The fix is to keep the charisma stat and make a correction to the character's stat distribution to reflect how the character is actually being played.  Since it almost never happens that a character in play comes off exactly as originally designed, then there's got to be some way of enforcing or encouraging a correction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395972/#Comment_395972" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T20:01:50+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  8:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Waaaaaait a second.

In tactical RPGs (lets say "chess" as a subsystem in a fictive RPG), it would test the players analytical skills, and that is actually OK in most minds. The only difference is that the players in these kind of tactical systems don't get judged by the GM like poodles at an dog exhibition. Remove the dog exhibition bit, and I would have not trouble with player charisma affecting character skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395974/#Comment_395974" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T20:21:46+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  8:21PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 12:44AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zachary, if it fits the game's priorities, I'd say go ahead and ditch the Charisma stat.  <br/><br/>I have a game where that approach fits perfectly, and it's awesome.

People are okay with things not being fair. </b><br/>That can be because they still think the gaming experiences will be awesome, even if it not fair.

Depending on the gaming system, it can be used so little that no one cares about it all.  Maybe you'd roll once to see if you convince a town guard to let you pass.<br/><br/>But for games with more talking and interpersonal mechanics, the "charisma" stat is still surrounded by player roleplaying.  If a player gives an actual convincing speech to the guard (/GM), then what is the meaning of the Charisma roll done by the character?  The guard (/GM) is convinced.  A failed Charisma roll would imply some interfering force that neither the player nor the GM can explain.<br/><br/>So, it makes sense that for some games the roleplaying comes first, and the roleplaying defines the character.  After all, the player group came together to play by TALKING; if some players are not sure how to do so in the group, they can be encouraged to learn.  And if the group came together to, say, climb walls, fire BB guns, and shoot arrows, then that is also their prerogative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396244/#Comment_396244" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T16:57:39+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  4:57PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CHARISMA IS MY DUMP STAT, YOU SNIVELING FUCKER.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396257/#Comment_396257" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T19:04:55+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  7:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My question would be: how does this improve character building or improve the story?<br/><br/>I would think that this limits character options for the players, meaning you can't have players engage the story in certain ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396293/#Comment_396293" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T00:36:45+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 12:36AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My question would be: how does this improve character building or improve the story?<br/><br/>I would think that this limits character options for the players, meaning you can't have players engage the story in certain ways.</blockquote>\nBecause it can give more room for the subtle interaction and complex issues of conversation. To reduce conversation with another human being to a purpose that you either succeed with or not (bribing the guard or not) you miss out on all the rich other stuff that goes on on a conversation.<br/><br/>What means more engagement for some type of players means more engagement for others. I personally don't like when stuff like conversation is determined or simplified to simple purpose you simply succeed with or not. It a not very fun way or interesting way to model something like communication. A roll doesn't keep you from roleplaying, but setting a stake and deciding what a conversation "is about" and what the "purpose" of the conversation is limits and  models the conversation into a very limited frame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396356/#Comment_396356" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T09:22:31+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  9:22AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I find setting the stakes and topic useful, especially as a GM, if it's an NPC I haven't developed, I need something to go off, and I need it fast.

I'm comparing TT to live combat larp (where player charisma is almost always dominant).<br/><br/>In a larp, you have 12 different NPCs played by 12 different people, all at the same time. If you're trying to convince one of them to, for example, follow you to the edge of town so your friends can ambush them, then you actually set that up and do it. You choose your victim. You act out whatever diversion you think will get them to come away with you. You lead them away. You shank them.<br/><br/>Part of why this works so well in larp is step one - choose your victim. Again, there are 12 NPCs to choose from played by different players. You can look them over, talk to them, and get a sense of which one you should try to lure away, and how you should try to do it. You might convince the shady looking merchant guy to slip off and talk about an illegal business deal. You might convince the mercenary you need a paid guard for a dangerous trip. You might convince the cleric you have someone who needs healing or wants to talk points of faith.<br/><br/>By having all those NPCs to interact with, you have lots of opportunities for real life assessment and acting to play out in an interesting way.<br/><br/>In tabletop, you usually just have the one GM representing all those people. Having some chance element worked in can be a good way to make things work out differently and inspire unexpected outcomes to riff off of.<br/><br/>If you approach social skills as an opportunity to introduce interesting complications and inspirations, rather than gateways to be unlocked, then having a few dice to roll can add to the fun.<br/><br/>If all you're going to do with them is decide whether or not something works like a social light switch, then it's probably best to remove them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sir_Knight" title="Sir_Knight"><img alt="Sir_Knight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nJ5F4CQNLJE3E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sir_Knight">Sir_Knight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396389/#Comment_396389" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T11:27:39+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 11:27AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 11:28AM by Sir_Knight.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think an issue those last few posts brought up is, simply, number.  It's a distribution of "mental resources" (including patience).  If this one shady merchant is the (or a) pivotal encounter in the session, then play mechanics that emphasize conversation make it richer.  If all those encounters are actual people (i.e., LARP), then there are enough "mental resources" to make all conversations rich.<br/><br/>However, if you need to bribe three "NPCs I haven't developed" in a row, anything that slows down play is counterproductive.<br/><br/>This sort of thinking has been applied to other parts of gameplay, including combat.  Some RPG I've forgotten created "cannon fodder" or "cardboard cutout" enemies, where they were simply easier to kill via dramatic methods.  That is, weapons such as the shotgun got a bonus against them, so whole swaths could be cut down and the characters could move on to the "boss fight."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396403/#Comment_396403" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T12:01:00+00:00" title="November  5, 2012 12:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the player annoyed me earlier in the night?

I see points and issues here and there. To me, it kind of seems like ditching the Charisma Attribute can the potential to work given the right group of players, but in general is probably not the best way to handle it for a game designed to work with most groups. Though, this does get me wondering about how different groups handle the overlap of player and character charisma.<br/><br/>As a GM, I usually let the player decide how they want handle any particular social situation. If the player just declares what they want their character to accomplish (like, "I want to convince the guard to let me past."), I always ask for a more elaborate description ("How?", "I try to pass myself off as a former guard.") and then let them roll to see how well they do ("I rolled a 18!", "Okay, the guard doesn't ask too many questions and you manage to convince him to let you enter."). <br/><br/>Otherwise, if the player starts role-playing (like, "I walk up to the guard and say, 'Hey man! Remember me? I used to be a member of the guard just like you. Is Josin still kickin', that old bastard?'") I will let the scene play out, and depending on how clever they're being (yes, my subjective opinion) I may let them get an automatic success, or call for that roll after all. If they go with role-playing and don't do a great job, but roll well, I'll retcon the conversation to some extent in order to make the success believable, or reduce the NPC's resistance to giving the player what they want. So, within my line of thinking, if the player puts forth some effort to role-play, they end up with a better chance of success overall. In a way, I use the role-playing as a social version of physical fictional positioning. So players might not have to roll if they role-play cleverly,  in the same way a player describing their super-clever method to sneak into a fortress might not have to roll for it because their description and ideas are so clever or creative. <br/><br/>How do you do it with your group?

My hoarder Boa is manipulative untrustworthy snake. Most of the manipulation she does, doesn't trigger the manipulation/seduction move, but is more subtle things. Body posture, word choice, physical placement in the room, body language.<br/><br/>The thing is, once the manipulation move IS triggered, it will be triggered in different context then if all that more subtle manipulation hadn't been going on.<br/><br/>Actual play example: My hoarder is rich as a troll. But right now there is a communist revolution going on and she made a deal and joined the communist movement to get access to the Angels healthcare.<br/><br/>She was getting care at the communist head quarters. In the kitchen some of the communist moments leaders had gathered informally after a battle to drink coffee.

So maybe the guard mentions how cold of a winter it looks like it'd be and how his wife would be so much more comfortable if he could get her that fur coat she's been wanting (ie. he's looking for a much bigger bribe). Because the player set up the situation well, what is on the line is how much the bribe is going to cost them, not whether or not the guard is willing to wave them by at all.<br/><br/>Also, of course, it's all so much easier in a system that takes steps to make failure fun and interesting and easier to embrace. The Principles and GM Moves in AW-engine games tend to encourage social encounters that are not pass/fail gateways.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts' Strings economy is an example of something interesting you can do with social moves that don't just result in pass/fail tests.

In old hack-and-slash gaming, where experience is earned by killing things, it's handled by giving experience for "roleplaying well."  Okay, so, we're probably not talking about hack-and-slash games: in ones with a more rounded system, the player still deserves something for Being There and Playing.  RobMcDiarmid's suggestion for setting up the situation sounds like an excellent mix of both "rewards for roleplaying" and ensuring game mechanics are not bypassed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396468/#Comment_396468" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T16:32:05+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  4:32PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Me: Well...

You shouldn't be allowed to bypass the roll because I, buzz, think you, Zachary, are a really entertaining guy. That's horribly socially dysfunctional behavior, IMO.<br/><br/>Personal charisma shouldn't be a stick the player uses to beat the game into submission; it's a tool they should use to enhance the gaming experience for <i>everyone</i>. Liven up the session with some engaging acting, or funny accents. Encourage others to break out of their shells and feel that the table is a safe space to indulge there inner thespian.<br/><br/>That's how I felt back in the day, and how I feel now.

You are reinforcing the shared fiction, and that's cool. <br/><br/>An anecdote: I once had a very by-the-book GM. One night, my character gave an impassioned plea to the town council. He had spent multiple sessions digging up background information, researching the counterpoints to his case and refuting them, and getting key players on his side. I roleplayed my speech using all these elements. And then my GM asked for a standard Diplomacy check. No modifiers, no bonus, literally nothing that had to do with the case I had presented. He didn't roleplay a counterpoint or even hesitancy from the council. The whole scene hinged on my die roll; I may as well have just said "I roll to convince them."

Lizzie Stark has written excellent article in States of Play "We Hold These Rules to be Self-Evident" on how American larp culture and American culture in general prioritize the games to be fair very highly in contrast to Nordic larp that don't. <a href="http://www.nordicrpg.fi/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/states_of_play_pdf_version.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nordicrpg.fi/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/states_of_play_pdf_version.pdf</a><br/><br/>That fairness should always be top priority is not a universal rule. It is a preference.<br/><br/>So it not that easy. You can't just say "Fairness should always be the highest priority so the most important thing is that the rules create a level playing field, the end. Period. " Because it not always the highest priority. Not everyone feels that a level playing field is the most important thing to a good gaming experience in every case.<br/><br/>Some people prioritize the experiences of rules-free  in character conversation higher then a level player field. And that also something worth exploring. It also worth exploring how you keep a game fair trough other means if the mechanical rules isn't about leveling the playing field.<br/><br/>Some players being better at some stuff and some character being better at some stuff isn't bad. Usually having one player that is really good as something is seen as an advantage, as someone that can help the other players develop as player and a skill used to support the game. It only bad if you use it to make other people experiences less good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396563/#Comment_396563" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T07:49:13+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  7:49AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So I give bonuses for a convincing use of the game world.

The whole scene hinged on my die roll; I may as well have just said "I roll to convince them." It was a bummer.</blockquote>\nThe issue here is that D&amp;D's rules for social interaction are terrible.<br/><br/>And that's another problematic aspect of this discussion; we're not talking in the context of a particular game or about an instance of play. When I would have this discussion on ENWorld back in the day, D&amp;D's poor handling of social conflicts was always held up as proof that "role" trumps "roll", i.e., that rolling dice for "talky" stuff was an inherently bad idea ("You should just role-play!"). But, honestly, if we were talking about BW (or TSoY, or DitV, etc.), we wouldn't even be having this discussion, because those games have functional rules.<br/><br/>Anyway... the simple fix for this is to take a page from AW: "To do it, do it."<br/><br/>If you want to melee with an opponent in D&amp;D, you have to move your mini (or at least establish your PC's position in some way), define a target, declare what weapon and abilities you are using, and then roll some dice.<br/><br/>So... if you want to convince a duke to lend your party aid, you have to establish in the fiction that such an opportunity exists, explain what it is you are going to say, declare what, if any, special abilities you are using, and the roll some dice. ("I roll to convince them" is a straw man. "I roll to attack them" wouldn't fly in D&amp;D, so I don't know why the former statement would.) <br/><br/>If one player wants to do do all of that in-character with a funny accent, let them. If they don't, but they still <i>establish all of the fiction necessary</i>, then that's cool, too.<br/><br/>E.g.:<br/><br/>"What ho, my liege! Forsooth, the time has come in which we must beg aid of thee; let me remind your grace of our previous battles on your behalf..." etc.<br/><br/>...and...<br/><br/>"I walk before the duke's throne and kneel.

I don't see that coming from the other thread participants at all. I think you might possibly be carrying in your ENWorld discussion baggage and transferring it onto the conversation rather than actually reading what is being written. Maybe. Perhaps you should reread and consider that. If you still think that's what is being said, point out an argument and I'll go back and reread as well.<br/><br/>Players playing a fighter in a game with lots of tactical choices surrounding combat get a bonus for being good tacticians as players because they make good tactical choices. In D&amp;D4e, for example, those who are good at playing the board game of positioning minis are rewarded while those who are bad at it are punished. My wife would be at a consistent disadvantage playing that game, compared to my son who is a whiz at such things.<br/><br/>As for clerics, that depends a lot on how religion is actually handled in the game. Usually it's not handled well at all, so the point is pretty well moot. But if I was in a game with real religions and the player was quoting real religious text then hell yes that would give them a bonus on what positive benefits they got out of being a cleric. Hell, if they were playing a game religion and consistently said things that sounded like they fit the religion well, I'd reward that as well. Totally.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, this isn't just about rewarding engaging roleplay with stat roll bonuses (which, I think, potentially happens in all aspects of play as part of fictional positioning if that is part of the system in play at the table).<br/><br/>The OP's original question was whether social stats should exist and be rolled at all.<br/><br/>So is your opinion that every social interaction should come down to a straight up stat roll with no room for adjustment based on how the player engages with the situation at hand and attempts to affect their fictional positioning?<br/><br/>Or do you just not want to see the charming guy consistently get an extra +4 to all his social rolls because he's such a naturally good talker?<br/><br/>Cause I don't think that would happen in practice.<br/><br/>Every time I see players and GMs do this sort of thing, they always adjust a bit for natural talent and repeated use. When the quiet shy mousy player rises to the occasion and produces some impassioned speachifying, they get a big bump. When the consistently charming talker gets chatty yet again, they don't get much at all - and if they do it too much, they get people shutting them down to keep them from hogging spotlight time.<br/><br/>But again, I don't think the focus is just on the straight up roll bonus.<br/><br/>I think the focus is on how you use social fictional positioning to frame the test.<br/><br/>If you do good work framing the situation through your roleplay, you make it a roll for how much the bribe is going to hurt your pocketbook or how humiliating your flirting needs to be to be effective or how big of a favor you're going to owe the mayor to get him to do what you need, rather than whether or not you succeed at all.<br/><br/>In Princess Bride terms, it's all about making it "to the pain" rather than "to the death". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396597/#Comment_396597" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T10:56:22+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 10:56AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do wish to point out that I don't really have an aim or an agenda here.

What do you mean?  If you're rolling a d20 to succeed, then your odds of success are the relevant concern.  So improving those odds is inherently good. </blockquote>\nYeah, but if you roll under 8 (or 6), the modification would turn out to be rather pointless. Or if you roll 12 or higher. So why do something that's not useful 80% of the time (or 70% with if the difficulty is changed with 6)?<br/><br/>And what good does it do to the player? Is it to encourage the player to roleplay in the future? To say "That's a good puppy. Now, have a bone"? But what if the player already is doing this because the player thinks it's fun? Is this kind of mechanical reward really necessary?</blockquote>\nSomeone in a different topic said they were paraphrasing Ron Edwards with the quote "It doesn't matter what the percentages are, all that matters is the outcome."<br/><br/>My surface read of that makes me want to say, "But if I have a 99% chance to win or lose, the odds do matter to me." But I think what this is trying to say is that if the player spends time role-playing and that get's them a +2 to their Charisma roll, but they fail the roll anyway, it feels like a wasted effort - like the reward wasn't worth it. Maybe, I dunno, I'm not that intellectual. Someone correct me, please.<br/><br/>There seems to be a few different opinions or approaches for specifically handling role-playing ability slash player charisma and how it influences success in the fiction:<br/><br/>Role-Playing Has Primary Influence on Social Actions<br/>- Strong RPers can lead a group in a positive way<br/>- Good RPing won't be stymied by bad rolls<br/>- Judgment of RPing is subject to opinion and GM disposition<br/>- Strong RPers can get an unfair advantage<br/><br/>System Has Primary Influence on Social Actions<br/>- Maintains balance with other character abilities<br/>- Prevents unfair advantages for naturally personable players<br/>- Does not encourage, may discourage, RPing<br/><br/>System and Role-Playing Share Influence on Social Actions<br/>- Good RPing could be stymied by dice rolls<br/>- Strong RPers may have some advantage<br/>- Reduces balance with other character abilities somewhat<br/>- Rules need to be clear about how system interfaces with role-playing<br/><br/>Anything I missed or got wrong?\n<blockquote><br/>E.g.:<br/><br/>"What ho, my liege! Forsooth, the time has come in which we must beg aid of thee; let me remind your grace of our previous battles on your behalf..." etc.<br/><br/>...and...<br/><br/>"I walk before the duke's throne and kneel.

I also remind him of the time we retrieved the BaneSword..." etc.<br/><br/>...should be mechanically treated the same. Otherwise, it's dancing monkeys. </blockquote>\nTotally agreed. A strong description of the social tactics used by the character should be just as meaningful as actually pretending to be the character and say the lines. One question is whether or not a GM should judge the colorfulness of the narration or the quality of the role-playing and allow that to have an influence on the mechanics. Someone people say yes, others say no.<br/><br/>To me, this is a solid way to implement "to do it, you do it", which I understand to be descriptive mechanics - the fiction triggers the mechanics. This is in comparison to Rickard's example, where the mechanics are being used prescriptively - I say I want to use Deception to bypass the guard, roll the dice, and the results determine how I should narrate or role-play the attempt. <br/><br/>Both are viable options in game design. Apocalypse World and Dungeon World mechanics are both prescriptive and descriptive, which results in the mechanics being implemented as a sort of filter for the fiction to go through and determine the nature of the outcome. You have to generate fiction in order to trigger the mechanics descriptively, then engage the mechanics to determine level of success, and then use those mechanical results prescriptively to influence the narration or role-playing of the outcome.

He also talks about bypassing rolls entirely based on his self-admittedly subjective assessment of their performance. The trigger phrase for me here is <i>puts forth some effort to role-play</i>; it implies that roleplaying <i>isn't happening</i> when we're not doing the charismatic actor thing. Other people have expressed concerns similar to mine, as well.\n<blockquote>So is your opinion that every social interaction should come down to a straight up stat roll with no room for adjustment based on how the player engages with the situation at hand and attempts to affect their fictional positioning?</blockquote>\nNo. Of course we're engaging with the fiction; that's what roleplaying is. (Again, "I roll to convince them" is a straw-man; nobody is saying that's an acceptable mode of play.) My assertion is that you shouldn't prioritize the <i>method</i> used to engage. We've been down that path before; it turns the game into a bid for the GM's affection. Our hypothetical charisma-monster could be totally dismissive of the fiction while still putting on a display that somehow impresses the GM. Should they really be rewarded for that?<br/><br/>I realize that players have different strengths. Tactical players will obviously fare better in games like D&amp;D 3e/4e. You can't please everyone all the time. But, hey, how about you have the tacticians give the non-tacticians pointers? And have the charismatic/social players support the shy players: "Oh, hey Rob, you could remind the duke about the time we retrieved that sword for him!" Or have them ham it up playing NPCs now and then.<br/><br/>I reiterate, of course we want to engage with the fiction; that's the <i>prerequisite</i> for going to the dice. But we should still go to the dice. And sure, if player comes up with a really brilliant idea ("Hey, didn't we retrieve a valuable sword for the duke?"), they should be able to lobby for some sort of bonus; they're calling on a resource, just like they would in a melee.<br/><br/>But don't give charismatic player a "Get out of jail free" card... not unless you're going to give them out for other strengths, too. "Wow, you've set up an incredible defensive position; there's no way the goblins can win. You defeat them, no rolls necessary."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396605/#Comment_396605" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T11:43:07+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 11:43AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Totally agreed.

Likewise, they guy who was taking careful notes and lending helping dice all night will probably win Workhorse.<br/><br/>My overall question for this thread would be: What problem are you trying to solve?<br/><br/>If it's getting players to better engage with the fiction, my advice would be: play games that prioritize the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396606/#Comment_396606" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T11:43:21+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 11:43AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 buzz                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396614/#Comment_396614" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T13:22:06+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  1:22PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 1:38PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buzz, I understand your focus on "player putting forth effort to role-play gets a bonus", and admit that this was a poor choice of words on my part. Earlier in that post I said "this can work for some groups, not all groups." in reference to a player's personal charisma. Also, if you reread what I wrote, it was the player's cleverness (not acting ability or personal charisma) being used as the key judging factor as to whether or not they need to roll or get a bonus to their roll. By "putting forth an effort", I meant providing some beneficial fictional positioning for their character via role-playing or narrating their social approach in a clever and creative way, not necessarily gaining my favor by being a good actor or doing great accents. I don't think that rewarding a player for being clever is "dance monkey dance", it's fictional positioning.<br/><br/>There was a thread regarding how difficult dragons should be in Dungeon World. The resounding moral of the story that I gathered from that thread was: You don't even get to roll to attack the dragon unless you can position yourself fictionally in a place where you can conceivably do that. The opposite is true too: You don't roll Hack and Slash if you cleverly dislodge a stalagtite from the cavern ceiling and drop it on the dragon. This goes back to the old D&amp;D situation of you don't have to roll to attack and kill the unconscious goblin because the fictional situation bypasses the necessity to roll. D&amp;D had the Coup de Grace move for this.  <br/><br/>The same can be said for this discussion. If a character is trying to convince the duke to release some prisoners and the player is clever enough to blackmail the duke by reminding him that they know about his nightly trips to the brothel, as a GM, if it makes sense, I'll logically rule that the duke gives in without the need to roll because the player created fictional leverage over the NPC that allowed them to automatically succeed. The player is being rewarded for cleverness and engaging with the established fiction in an intelligent way.<br/><br/>I love the idea of different awards being given out at the end of the session for people who contributed to the game in a positive way, whether it's being helpful, giving great descriptions, miming their attacks entertainingly, being super creative with world building, helping with book keeping, role-playing their characters passionately, bringing delicious snacks, or making everyone laugh their asses off. Hopefully, these are all things the players are happy to do and have fun doing in the first place, so the rewards are just there to validate their efforts, not meant to be a carrot on a stick for dancing monkeys. I still think there is room to reward a player's fictional positioning on a roll by roll basis as well, not by numeric adjustments, but by changing the nature or the stakes of the roll (ie, how much the bribe is, not whether or not they'll get past the guard). \n<blockquote>My overall question for this thread would be: What problem are you trying to solve?</blockquote>\nThe point of the thread itself was see how people felt about removing the Charisma stat from the player and going purely off of role-playing. I wanted people to tell me about why it works and why it doesn't work. That's all. There have been quite a few people pointing out problems that result from a design decision like this, so maybe there have been some suggestions on solutions to those problems, but the thread itself has no problem to solve exactly. Mostly it is intended to chew the fat with people who have a strong understanding of these topics. <br/><br/>Overall, Buzz, you have given me some of the best answers so far, and I definitely thank you for your contributions to the thread. Unfortunately, your wisdom seems to be veiled behind a sort of elitist attitude that was apparent in your first snarky comment. I mean, just because you've got a clear understanding of the problems and solutions inherent to this topic, doesn't mean everyone else does. You found your answers on ENWorld six years ago - consistently pointing that out and claiming this is an outdated discussion comes off as very condescending to less enlightened folk like me. You say "I thought we were past this" as if to suggest that nobody else needs to discuss and understand this stuff since you already got it figured out on some other internet forum six years ago. Not to mention, there is no "one true way" and all that. But again, behind all that are greatly appreciated comments.<br/><br/>I don't think we can say "Play Burning Wheel and all your questions will be answered!" Maybe there have been some games that have solid approaches that eliminate some of the snags, but that doesn't mean those are the end-all-be-all approaches. It's great to learn from them, but discussions can still be fruitful, especially in the event that we don't have access to the suggested text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396615/#Comment_396615" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T13:24:04+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  1:24PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I reiterate, of course we want to engage with the fiction; that's the <i>prerequisite</i> for going to the dice.

If a character is trying to convince the duke to release some prisoners and the player is clever enough to blackmail the duke by reminding him that they know about his nightly trips to the brothel, as a GM, if it makes sense, I'll logically rule that the duke gives in without the need to roll because the player created fictional leverage over the NPC that allowed them to automatically succeed. The player is being rewarded for cleverness and engaging with the established fiction in an intelligent way.</blockquote>\nJust to pick a knit...<br/><br/>If you're talking about Dungeon World, then making the manipulate move requires you to have leverage in order to trigger it. So getting blackmail material is the player's way of triggering the move in the first place. You should still roll.<br/><br/>However, results are informed by the fiction, so if you are informing the duke that you have the originals of the blackmail documents in safe keeping with someone who will expose them if anything happens to you, this certainly shackles the duke in his response even if you fail the roll - he's not going to just have his guards attack you the way he might have if you hadn't set up your fictional positioning that way. Instead of failure meaning that the duke doesn't cave, it can instead trigger some sort of other GM move, like <b>Separate them</b>. So maybe you get what you wanted, but with harder consequences because you failed the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396620/#Comment_396620" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T14:01:47+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  2:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Just to pick a knit...</blockquote>\nOkay, fair enough. In *World games, there is usually a manipulate type move that would have gotten triggered, true. <br/><br/>But more importantly, I like your overall point - perhaps giving an "automatic success" is functionally the same as adjusting the chances to the point where the player can't fail, which doesn't strike me as interesting as changing the stakes of the roll. Since the player has solid blackmail evidence, the stakes aren't whether or not the duke will release the prisoners (he's definitely going to), but whether or not the duke will retaliate against the character for the blackmailing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396621/#Comment_396621" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T14:06:52+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  2:06PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>By "putting forth an effort", I meant providing some beneficial fictional positioning for their character via role-playing or narrating their social approach in a clever and creative way, not necessarily gaining my favor by being a good actor or doing great accents.

But, for me, what we are calling "fictional positioning" is the core of what play is about: "For something to happen, it has to be both mechanically possible and make sense within the fiction for the group" (<a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2008/03/08/fictional-positioning-101/" rel="nofollow">Reference</a>). I think what triggered me was relating this to "Charisma" stats in the first place, i.e., "Why do we need to roll dice, let's just role-play." To me, that's dancing monkey territory; that may not have been what you were trying to talk about, though.<br/><br/>(Honestly, I found the use of the phrase "fictional positioning" sort of confusing in this discussion. Maybe that's just me.)\n<blockquote>Unfortunately, your wisdom seems to be veiled behind a sort of elitist attitude that was apparent in your first snarky comment.

Having a clever approach to a social interaction could provide the necessary positioning to warrant some kind of bonus. Some people have mentioned they don't mind that bonus being a numeric modifier (get +3 to your Charisma roll for reminding the duke you found his lost sword), but I kind of prefer changing the stakes of the roll ("Okay, the duke feels compelled to oblige given your past deed of finding his sword, so you don't have to roll to get the duke to do what you want, but you're rolling to see if demands anything further in return since you've reminded him how skilled you are with finding things for him."). <br/><br/>Is that a functional approach?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396636/#Comment_396636" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T17:17:45+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  5:17PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2012 5:18PM by Paul_T.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a good approach.<br/><br/>I've always liked the model where what you say determines *how* you're tackling the problem, and then the dice tell us *how well* that method works.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>A. You want to kill an orc.<br/>B. You want to convince a guard to let you pass.<br/><br/>How do you tackle this problem? What do you actually do?<br/><br/>A. "I call out to it, draw my sword, and rush in, hoping to hack it before it hacks me!"<br/>B. "I offer the guard a bribe, saying, 'Hey, man, I lost my ticket. Here's the cost of one, why don't you let me through?"<br/><br/>How well does it work?<br/><br/>A. You roll well. You kill the orc. You roll poorly, the orc hurts you.<br/>B. You roll well, the guard accepts. You roll poorly, the guard calls security instead.<br/><br/>Now, the *how* is always important. That's the fictional positioning part. If the orc is sleeping and you drop a statue on it, you might not need to roll: you win the fight. If you can come up with a bribe the guard has no reason to refuse (e.g. offering him a new, better job as a guard somewhere else), no need to roll, he lets you in.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, same tactics just won't work. You can't attack the dragon with a ping pong paddle; no guard will let you in for a 25-cent bribe.<br/><br/>Why do you need the rolling? Aside from game balance and similar concerns, here are three points that come to mind:<br/><br/>1. Separating these two things conceptually, you allow a richer variety of playstyles. I can play the guy who's clumsy or untrained but still beats everyone in a fight because he's just lucky/brutal/blessed/faster/more experience/whatever. I give a description of an attack that might not work for someone else, but we all know that's just some colour for who the character is: the dice show the effects.<br/><br/>Likewise, you can play a character who thinks she's really smooth, but actually is always under suspicion because she just can't get the local accent quite right. <br/><br/>Or you can play someone who's dumb and inarticulate, and yet everyone loves her/him. (We all know someone like that.) Maybe a beautiful woman with a lousy personality still generally gets what she wants in your game world.<br/><br/>2. Injecting certain randomized procedures can enrich our play. Maybe the game we're using creates interesting twists or interesting consequences when we engage the mechanics, or determines how many experience points you get, or what resources are at risk. <br/><br/>Otherwise we should just play freeform, right?<br/><br/>Injecting the unexpected into our games also gives us creative constraints and creates new situations we might not come up with if we were just freeforming. That can be a valuable goal for many games and many groups.<br/><br/>3. In most fictional situations, there is enough undefined that we don't KNOW how things will turn out. When you say you swing at the orc's head, how tired is your arm, actually? How low is the orc's stance? Who has faster reflexes? We don't know, but the dice will tell us.<br/><br/>Will the guard be tempted by your offer, or are they so loyal to their job that they'd rather turn you down? We don't know: this is just an NPC we invented on the spot. Does the guard value a bit of spare cash? Does the guard feel a strong sense of loyalty to the organization they work for, or have they been thinking about quitting for the last two months anyway? The dice will tell us.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396641/#Comment_396641" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T17:53:32+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  5:53PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Someone in a different topic said they were paraphrasing Ron Edwards with the quote "It doesn't matter what the percentages are, all that matters is the outcome."<br/><br/>My surface read of that makes me want to say, "But if I have a 99% chance to win or lose, the odds do matter to me." But I think what this is trying to say is that if the player spends time role-playing and that get's them a +2 to their Charisma roll, but they fail the roll anyway, it feels like a wasted effort - like the reward wasn't worth it. Maybe, I dunno, I'm not that intellectual. Someone correct me, please.</blockquote>\nOK, here is another way to solve it. By doing some character play, you get a +3 bonus on any roll that you can apply afterwards. This is a bonus that you can use only once. So if you roll 14 and need a 16, you can use your bonus that you "unlocked" through character play.<br/><br/>THAT is when it actually feels like when the bonus matters.<br/><br/>But you know what? This is highly theoretical, because this is a way of thinking that is totally wrong. By talking about mechanical bonuses (or rewards) when it comes to something that is totally different to what roleplaying games were intended to handle in the beginning: to unlock doors and kill goblins.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games follows the same circle: you kill monsters, get XP, get higher stats so you can kill even bigger monsters. It it goes on like that. You get mechanical rewards to solve things in a mechanical way. It's the same thing with bonuses - it's something mechanical that is used to solve something in a mechanical way (die roll).<br/><br/>To play out your character or to tell stories are totally different. Players who do that do it because it's fun, just like the players who want mechanical bonuses think it's fun to get them. Encourage this by giving the method actors more to play with. Give them more relations, more situations that establish or challenge their personality and social consequences of their actions (both good and bad). In short: give them more interaction with other people. Dice rolls may still be included, but like what have already been said: the downside of a failed roll may differ depending on what situations the roleplaying part may lead to. Perhaps the guard will let them pass, but with more gold changing hands?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396647/#Comment_396647" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T19:02:45+00:00" title="November  6, 2012  7:02PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Roleplaying games follows the same circle...<br/>To play out your character or to tell stories are totally different.</blockquote>\nErm?

So, "I try to persuade my way past the guard by convincing him that the princess sent for me - I'm dressed like a handmaiden, right?". Once that's happened, and mostly regardless of how plausible or implausible their plan seems, it's up to their character skill, and if they succeed we play out the success. I reward actions with bonuses (so, wearing the handmaiden outfit), but not speech. If they fail, I tend to narrate their failure (and make a hard move, though I've yet to actually play AW. Soon..)<br/><br/>If the player feels like there's a way to accomplish their goal, but can't think of a way, then we talk about it a bit. "I'm pretty sure there's a way I can manipulate this guy into letting me past, but I can't think of how. I'm pretty sure my character could though.. any ideas?". We don't spend too long on it, and if we can't think of anything we just say 'none of your ideas seem plausible. Maybe you should try something else.'<br/><br/>This all sits on top of an advancement system which rewards being characterful (kind of keys-like) and in genre, and it works pretty well for us - if you want to have long conversations, you'll get rewarded for it, whereas if you just want to get past the guard you can easily roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396681/#Comment_396681" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T03:24:53+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  3:24AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2012 3:27AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the breadth of responses here nicely illustrates that different solutions are appropriate for different games/groups/goals.

In a game with any sort of strategic element, it's easy to wander over the line between <i>player system-optimizing</i> and <i>character situation-optimizing</i>.  Forming a plan to attack from above so you can use your excellent Jump skill is essentially <i>both</i>.  Whether smooth-talking an NPC also falls into that category really depends on the game, group, and goals.<br/><br/>Zachary, I think that works as an example of fictional positioning with known outputs: if you move to the high ground, you can use Jump.  The requirements for using Jump are pretty clear.  Social skills tend to defy that type of clarity because instead of operating on a known, static entity (like, y'know, gravity), they operate on an NPC's brain.  So, you can fictionally position all day -- giving the NPC reasons to love you, fear you, want to work with you, etc. -- but in the end it disappears into the black box of the GM's knowledge of this NPC and opinion of what would work.<br/><br/>Many solutions exist, but all are matters of taste:<br/>- screw the GM's knowledge and opinion of this NPC; let the dice determine the NPC's reaction, full stop<br/>- screw fictional positioning for effect; resolve outcomes first, and then narrate in appropriate fiction second<br/>- screw formal game-play; let's trust our GM to decide, abiding by our shared principles for what makes a fun session<br/>- screw consistency; let's pick the best system (no dice/coin flip/4d12/etc.) for each situation on the spot<br/>- let's not be extreme here; let's combine a bit of all of the above<br/><br/>If you do the first one, then you can treat it just like a Jump, with a long list of numeric social skills and pretty clear requirements about which you can use when.<br/><br/>If you do the fourth or fifth ones, you can still have rollable skills, but you won't know when you'll get to use them.<br/><br/>I haven't gotten much sense of your group in this thread, so I can't really recommend one.<br/><br/>Your idea about excellent roleplay altering the stakes is, if the GM has authority over the alteration, a version of "fictional positioning <i>might</i> matter, you won't know till the GM rules on it".  Is that helpful?  I guess it depends on whether you have some idea of whether that sort of thing works for your group.  I do think "changing stakes" is a neat thing to ask the GM to focus on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396687/#Comment_396687" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T05:20:41+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  5:20AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2012 5:24AM by vasquas.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one of my RPG if not resolved simply chatting, resolves mechanically. <br/><br/>There is the social bar, if the "social bar" comes tricked, your idea passes, but only for a specific purpose (declared by the player while talking ), if the bar instead reaches "brainwashed" to believe in the words than the PG will have a feeling of confidence in the character that he plagiarized.

Typically, we go to the rules when the next step isn't clear. Did I convince the guard to let me in? Did I manage to wound the goblin? Was it an overwhelming success, or hard-won?<br/><br/>Now, let me paraphrase a smart thing Mike Mearls once said: "A good rule is one that makes the game more fun than it would have been without it."<br/><br/>Ideally, the rules make determining that unclear outcome more interesting than it would have been if we just said yes. The savvy player's excellent plan is undermined by her PC's low Charisma. The timid player's weak plan goes over like gangbusters when her Cha 18 paladin rolls a 52 on their Diplomacy check; hijinks ensue!<br/><br/>Now, if the rules don't make this outcome any more interesting, I can see why one would want to jettison them entirely and just talk it out; that's how we did it back in the day! That's why my recommendation tends to be, "You should try a different game." <br/><br/>To bring this full-circle, my feeling is that leaving it all up to negotiation leaves too much room for group social shenanigans. It certainly can work, but it opens the door for all kinds of dysfunction that designers have worked to overcome for a decade or more now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396711/#Comment_396711" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T11:00:29+00:00" title="November  7, 2012 11:00AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In D&amp;D I liked to do the opposite of this:  roll the d20 for your social skill check before you roleplay doing anything besides stating intent.<br/><br/>After that, roleplay the interaction out, using your roll and success/failure to indicate how you should roleplay the scene.<br/><br/>Very few people I played with liked this idea much at all.

Sometimes having someone who is fully persuaded but still doesn't cooperate is a good thing for characterization.  Here's an example:<br/><br/>nWoD game, the characters are members of a crime family who, a few years previous, had been devastated by a horrible war with a drug cartel. Tons of people murdered, in jail, etc. Completely pushed the family out of the drug business.  Player character goes to NPC who lost her beloved husband first when he had to kill someone and then again when someone killed him in retaliation.  He attempts to convince her that taking a particular action against an obstreporous and potentially violent relative is in her best interest and the best interest of the family. PC gives a thorough, persuasive case and gets a success on his roll. <br/><br/>I say "Her voice shakes, tears well up in her eyes. 'I won't start this shit again. You're right, but it's not gonna be me that starts this shit again. I can't, I just can't.'"  What he got out of that was not her cooperation, but her capitulation.  Everybody knew that this conflict could emotionally destroy her, and it also showed that when it came to war, she didn't have the stomach for it anymore, even if it would hurt her, or hurt the family.  <br/><br/>I put the NPC in his hands rather than giving him what he "wanted".  If this were a conflict resolution system, the player would have just got what the PC wanted, and blah blah blah, boring.  By putting in this unexpected result - she's persuaded, she knows what the PC is saying is right, but she <i>can't bring herself to do what she knows is the right thing</i>, that becomes an important part of her characterization, and what the PC does with that becomes an important part of his. (He was so taken aback that he seriously rethought his approach. I made an NPC cry?!?)<br/><br/>I don't even know that the dice added that much to this decision.  If I said "you can't roll for this, you have to just tell me what you say", it might have worked just as well. Or maybe the dice showed him in a way my descriptions couldn't that he REALLY HAD persuaded her, that when she said "you're right", that's REAL, which gives her continued refusal more weight.  I'm not sure.<br/><br/>People are complicated and "persuasion", as opposed to sales, isn't a binary thing that can be determined with a pass/fail result, or even with a range of results. <br/><br/>I don't know how to model this in a system other than another human being thinking about the psychology of the character and responding accordingly, normally another player or GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397330/#Comment_397330" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T09:44:11+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  9:44AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another interesting thing that I've noticed is that if a system has a cut-and-dry diplomacy-type skill, with listed difficulty numbers for tasks, it presents a very misleading case. Sometimes there is just <i>no way</i> an NPC will go along with a player's action. If you try to convince the king to give his throne to you, it doesn't matter how many skill points you have or if you roll a critical success or whatever. That's just <i>not gonna happen</i>, y'know? So I feel like we necessarily need some combination of mechanics and roleplaying/immersion. There's no way to just separate them without making things ridiculous, right?

I guess it depends on your criteria for what's being modeled.  Duel of Wits choices certainly <i>could</i> be made just by the stats and odds and with no concern for character psychology... and the mechanical outputs would provide a sort of bare bones fictional result.

I point it out as it is the only system I have seen(my experience is broad, but not complete) that smoothly handles multiple opponents and multiple goals.<br/><br/>As a game powered by Fate the use of Aspects allow for a character to find out another character's(or NPC's) weaknesses and exploit them. I also mention it as the SRD is online. Generally I point this game to people who are looking to understand how a proper social system could work, but do not wish to invest in a whole new game which they may not want to play after they read it.<br/><br/>when speaking of binary social systems I find that they are usually used in games that are not focused at all in a social direction. The biggest example being D&amp;D, which is focused on combat and loot. I love D&amp;D, i love combat and loot, however I would never want to run a political game with the existing rules. It would take some serious retooling to make that work. My advice would be, find the game you want to play and play that. Some games have a concept that you love, but rules you hate. You may be so in love with the concept that you think the rules are also great(I had this issue with exalted for years...come to think of it I think I still do, dammit!). <br/><br/>Really look at the rules. What do they focus on? What style of play do they enable, enforce, and enhance? Is that what you want to play? Is there a better game out there?<br/><br/>Now I am just rambling so I will stop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397903/#Comment_397903" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T18:05:36+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  6:05PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html#social-combat" rel="nofollow">Here's the link to Diaspora's social conflict system.</a>  Thanks, gtroc!

I point it out as it is the only system I have seen(my experience is broad, but not complete) that smoothly handles multiple opponents and multiple goals.<br/><br/>As a game powered by Fate the use of Aspects allow for a character to find out another character's(or NPC's) weaknesses and exploit them. I also mention it as the SRD is online. Generally I point this game to people who are looking to understand how a proper social system could work, but do not wish to invest in a whole new game which they may not want to play after they read it..</blockquote>\nThis reminds me of a Diaspora/Dresden mash-up game I was in (gothic fantasy ... IN SPACE). We had a lot of multi-party social engagements. The GM would set the stakes (at least, those we were privy to) and tell us what each party's goal was/appeared to be and then we'd go at it. He'd summarize stuff NPC's said to each other, usually, but sometimes he didn't mind talking to himself and we didn't mind him doing it.<br/><br/>We didn't use Diaspora's social features all the time, but we liked them. More than that, though, I feel like Aspects and the FATE economy went a long way to establishing interesting social engagements with variable fictional stakes. So did Consequences, the Stress track and the ability to forfeit an engagement on your own terms. My character wasn't much for conversation so sometimes I'd hang in there because she was also rather stubborn but sometimes I'd take myself out of combat with a "Screw this, You people talk it over, I'll be over here" attitude. My social skills were awful, but that didn't mean I was always at the mercy of NPCs when social combat came around. I had options. I could have, for example, chosen to play the same stats as a character capable of more but utterly apathetic. I just don't <i>bother</i> unless the situation is right (i.e. the aspects are stacked so that I can mechanically perform in social combat).<br/><br/>FATE's aspects system was what really made these encounters work; you could have awful up-front social stats but use clever engagement with the fiction to stack useful aspects via other stats or static rolls versus the environment. More socially competent players could use the stack for a slam-dunk attack. While the talkers are busy engaging directly you can very noisily bar the doors for an aspect on the scene like "Trapped" or "Cornered." Those little +2's add up. You could use knowledge of a character's Aspects to affect them in strange ways--using unorthodox skills for social combat, or simply getting a bonus to what would otherwise be an awful roll with traditional social skills. It wasn't boring to have bad stats.<br/><br/><br/>To the discussion at large:<br/><br/>For me the dice have always been about the unexpected. It's hard to imagine something suitably awesome and interesting with nothing to go on but your character back-stories.  It's a lot easier when the dice start ruling out possibilities and a lot more interesting when the stats and dice create novel outcomes. Maybe your gut feeling wouldn't be to let your character take a bullet to the leg in this scene but the dice tell you that it happens. Now you're in a situation you wouldn't have allowed for if you were having this dream or writing this novel or, perhaps, playing this out in free-form. Maybe your natural response to any dangerous scenario is to talk your way out of it. The dice tell you that it didn't work, or at least didn't go as planned. Now you use your stats and dice to find inspiration for alternative solutions. There isn't anything wrong with games that rely on less randomness, but the more acting and creative writing you require of your players, the more limited your game becomes in terms of finding unexpected outcomes. You shrink the scope of what can happen to what your players are capable of doing or what they think up first. These limits play a role in any RPG, but the dice expand the range of possibilities by subverting everyone's expectations at least some of the time in a way that is agnostic to skill and experience. For me, this isn't about fairness to the players who aren't as good at improv acting. It's about maximizing the unexpected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399145/#Comment_399145" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T12:34:24+00:00" title="November 29, 2012 12:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2012 12:49PM by Gwathdring.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>when speaking of binary social systems I find that they are usually used in games that are not focused at all in a social direction. The biggest example being D&amp;D, which is focused on combat and loot. I love D&amp;D, i love combat and loot, however I would never want to run a political game with the existing rules. It would take some serious retooling to make that work. My advice would be, find the game you want to play and play that. Some games have a concept that you love, but rules you hate. You may be so in love with the concept that you think the rules are also great(I had this issue with exalted for years...come to think of it I think I still do, dammit!). <br/><br/>Really look at the rules. What do they focus on? What style of play do they enable, enforce, and enhance? Is that what you want to play? Is there a better game out there?<br/><br/>Now I am just rambling so I will stop.</blockquote>\nIt is important to consider what the raw mechanics focus on and what they enable, enforce and enhance. But the flavor of a system can change dramatically with the way you run a game. For example, I'm currently in a game of Apocalypse World which champions and in some places enforces the idea of adjusting the fictional stakes rather than handing out concrete bonuses. If you miss a roll, failure is only on the table if it's interesting. The only thing certain on a miss is that the MC makes as hard a move as they like. Maybe you still get what you want, and the hard move is tangential. Maybe the MC doesn't feel like making all that hard a move this time. Maybe you get what you want with consequences. That's how Apocalypse World works. But my GM from the Diaspora game mentioned above did some similar things. We roll a bunch of things really badly? Sure, sometimes we failed at our core skills on not-so-difficult tasks. Even the best make mistakes. Sometimes we just wouldn't roll on easy enough tasks, though. And sometimes he'd pull an AW style failure. We were sneaking around a base looking for a captive and rolled really badly on some crucial steps. We still found the captive and evaded the guards ... it created a sense of dread as we went around. It couldn't be that easy. No way the target was that low. What's going on? We're almost back to our exit and we find ourselves trapped by the big bad and a squad of commandos. It felt great--we suffered consequence for our bad rolls, but we felt the impacts of the consequence in ways that made the fiction more exciting and intense. An ambush by a more capable foe rather than a big noisy fight with a bunch of grunts. Not that the latter couldn't have worked ... something similar to the latter happened in a previous attempt at infiltration that went hilariously bad. But that sort of flexible approach to GMing is, I think, a real asset to the fiction in any system.<br/><br/>Whatever the dice say, penalizing players for bad luck even if you can't as a group think of a way that such is interesting ... that seems like bad play to me. I don't think you can just let the dice speak the final word, even in a game like D&amp;D, and not end up frustrated with the system every so many sessions. There are bad systems and systems that don't work for game X or player group Y ... but there's a degree to which the GM takes ownership of creating non-functioning challenges and calling for uninteresting rolls in a given system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17480/character-charisma-vs-player-charisma" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17480/character-charisma-vs-player-charisma" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17480/character-charisma-vs-player-charisma/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17480%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17480%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
