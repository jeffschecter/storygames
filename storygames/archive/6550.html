It strikes me as a VERY successful Gamist RPG design.  Each instance of the game was an exciting challenge, often presenting unique situations and problems, and a thin veneer of situation.  The whole game (the series of dungeons in the main rulebook) was a very simple story that tied the challenges together.<br/><br/>I can still remember the feeling of apprehension every time we lined our little figures up on the starting tile, not knowing if the dungeon ahead would bring death or glory.  I think this effect was heightened by me being about 12 years old, but when I broke the game out again a few years ago, I recall it being pretty good then too.  That time around I really hammed it up, reading the sample text from the rulebook in my best "voice of doom", and we all called each other by our character roles: "Elf! I need healing!" <br/><br/>Does anyone else have fond Heroquest memories? What can we learn from this game? How can we make it better?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145275/#Comment_145275" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T07:40:44+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  7:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have just fond memories: I still have the game.

It was Heroquest that got me into wargaming and roleplaying, both at the same time, when I spotted the HQ issue of White Dwarf in my local newsagent (back in the day when WD had roleplaying in it too) just after getting HQ. Now, 18 years later, I'm an editor at White Dwarf! <br/><br/>It was a great game though, kinda like a self-contained rpg with a campaign all built in. The rules were nice and short too, and there was this in-built ability to open the box and start playing the game within minutes. I think that's something that'd be good to take from it - that instant accessibility and instant play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145379/#Comment_145379" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T16:57:53+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  4:57PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a hard question - why not just play it, instead of trying to expand on it? Why do you have to expand it?<br/><br/><br/>And here's an idea - take hero quest off the shelf. Take universalis off the shelf. Start playing universalis first, and treat heroquest as it's subject. There, you have a means of expanding heroquest <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
