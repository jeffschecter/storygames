So.<br/><br/>I need things externalized in my gameplay.  I need my character externalized; I need conflicts externalized; I need development externalized.  What do I mean by that?<br/><br/>Externalizing is this great American neologism that take a perfectly innocent adjective and implicates it as a verb.  Externalizing is taking what is inside and projecting it outside.  Which is uselessly abstract, so let's talk specifics.<br/><br/>Externalizing character is taking all that stuff inside your character and projecting it out into the world around your character.  Your character is caught between two cultures?  Then he's got two NPC friends, one from each culture, and they both want things from him.  His being caught between cultures isn't something he cries into his pillow at night, it's a problem he deals with in concrete terms whenever he interacts with his friends.<br/><br/>Externalizing conflict is similar.  Your character isn't going to decide which culture he "really" belongs to late one night after he's done crying into his pillow.  He's going to decide when his two friends want things that are mutually exclusive, and he has to choose between concrete options.<br/><br/>And when he makes that decision, the consequences of the decision can (and should, in my august opinion) be externalized.  The friend he chooses that one time starts making assumptions about later decisions; the friend he didn't choose gets distant.  This mirrors the changes happening within the character.<br/><br/>Now, these things are <em>essential</em> to my enjoyment of a game, not just neat tricks that make the game more fun.  I will not enjoy myself if the decisions that i make as a character are not expressed or elaborated out in the world of the story.  I will not enjoy myself if my character exists in a vacuum where nobody cares about the decisions he makes.  Seriously, I will feel like the GM is ignoring my creative input.<br/><br/>This is the problem that I've been encountering talking about Polaris and Mutual Decision, where it really bothers me that so much of the character, conflict, and development is "trapped" inside the character and does not get externalized into the world around them.  At the end of the day, I don't care what kind of a person you are if the kind of person you were didn't change anything in your world-- because the answer is, in my mind, that you're a boring kind of insignificant person-- and why do I care about that?<br/><br/>Anyway.  Resonance?  Sound familiar?  Or am I totally loopy again?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95073/#Comment_95073" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T09:54:35+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  9:54AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a character-focused version of "show, don't tell".

There are some conflicts in my characters I don't really care much if they're resolved, or put out into the real world in any <i>focused</i> way - instead, they inform all the other things he has to do, decide and deal with. If I want to keep a conflict so that it makes him cry into his pillow, that's okay! But I should be able to explicitly state what and why I want to do this.<br/><br/>I grope for an example. I played a budding newspaperman in a Thief: The Dark Project game. He had great agony over his belief in The Public versus his cynicism in People.  This informed but was never explicit in nearly everything he did.  And it would have been a waste of time to introduce the conflict in more focused terms because no other players at the table really gave a crap about it.  Still, the conflict, though primarily internal and never "explicitly" externalized, added to my enjoyment of play.<br/><br/>So I think there's a sliding scale:<br/><br/>At one end we have the conflict which the player never tells anyone about, even the other players.<br/><br/>Further along we have a conflict the player tells some other players about but only brings into play through internal thinking and application to unrelated or near-unrelated areas.<br/><br/>Further along we have a conflict the player tells the other players about but nobody really strongly pitches a situation right at that conflict.<br/><br/>And still further we have a conflict that is fully "externalized."

In a tragedy, the fall of the protagonist(s) uplifts the world they live in.  Tragic protagonists are sacrificial lambs that restore the proper ordering of the world.  Check out Fortinbras taking the throne at the end of Hamlet, after the corruption in Elsinore has been destroyed, or the Montagues and Capulets coming together over the bodies of Romeo and Juliet.  Tragedy externalizes development, and "positive" development, every time-- thus creating catharsis and all that good stuff.  <br/><br/>There ain't none of that in Polaris; you die, your loved ones die, and everybody else dies (or, bonus, become demons). The only thing you affect is inside the head of your character-- everything else is scattered to the winds, completely insignificant.<br/><br/>On Mutual Devision, the question of the game us whether or not you come out of the breakup emotionally crippled-- and the people around the relationship are mere color.  No tragedy there, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/alejandro" title="alejandro"><img alt="alejandro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/alejandro">alejandro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95123/#Comment_95123" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:58:15+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:58AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh,<br/><br/>The value in externalizing a problem or issue is that it not only gives you something tangible that you can interact with and affect, it also gives the other players something that they can interact with and affect.

That's one flavor of tragedy, certainly. But the defining character of tragedy is that the protagonist is doomed - either by something internal to themselves (as in classical tragedy) or by their insignificance in the face of forces larger than themselves (as in modern tragedy). Catharsis is something the <i>audience</i> is meant to experience. If anything, the Shakespeare examples you cite are ole Will engaged in his usual "beat the audience over the head with it" endings, which are a convention of Elizabethan drama and entirely unnecessary to the integrity of the work as a tragedy. If <i>Hamlet</i> ends on the bloodbath, with no Fortinbras, it's still the same work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95130/#Comment_95130" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T11:10:25+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 11:10AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 11:13AM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, Alex-- right there with you.

To elaborate: At the start of Polaris, everything is doomed.  At the end of Polaris, everything is still doomed.  Sure, stuff could have happened during play, but since everybody died and nothing lasts past the end of the game, the only place any of that has any significance is in the heads of the characters.  It's like Polaris externalizes things just enough for you to play at significance, then yanks the rug out from under you, denying you any satisfaction that anything meaningfully changed.<br/><br/>And that's sort of the crux of my question, here: that drives me batshit crazy, like a 7th Sea game where we worked hard to take down the big bad only to have the GM use the "reoccuring villain" rule to bring him back just as powerful as always.  What was the point on playing all that if it didn't make a difference?  Other folks really like Polaris-- is this because they don't need their game development to have a lasting impact?

On the other hand, some of the people I've played with don't set up these kinds of explicit internal conflicts.  I'm not sure that clarifies it, since it's possible the latter set do have implicit conflicts they want reflected in the game content that they don't vocalize or explicitly think about.

I am in 100% agreement with you that conflicts need to be externalize and impact "the world" but for purposes of any given story how large must "the world" be?  How about just one person?  What if my decisions and actions totally changes the fate of just one single person.<br/><br/>At minimum that's what It Was A Mutual Decision is about.  It's not "do *I* end up an emotional cripple mess" but look across the table at the other character and where THEY ended up.  How much (for good and bad) of where they ended up were YOU responsible for.  I also disagree that the mutual friends and family members in It Was A Mutual Decision are mere color.  In my very first It Was A Mutual Decision game I felt that the male character's neglect of his mother contributed directly to her death that happened in the game.  But you know what?  I and my character's inability to cope with being alone directly contributed to that.<br/><br/>So I ask is one elderly character's death from neglect by her own son enough for you?  Or in my second It Was A Mutual Decision game where an NPC brother decided he'd rather be fanboy than a brother.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the topic of time.  In the first It Was A Mutual Decision game the mother's death came about from exactly three points in the game.  The first was simply my commitment during setup that the male PC have a sick mother.  The second was when the male PC chose to stay with his girlfriend rather than move in to take care of her and indeed left one of his wererat brood to take care of her instead.  The third was when we framed a scene directly to mom's funeral.  That's it.  A note at setup and two scenes in the whole game.  Would that be enough for you?  I know when Laura said, "It's the mom's funeral" *my* eyes lit up in horror given the state of affairs we last left the mom in.<br/><br/>Even shorter was the role of the brother in the second It Was A Mutual Decision game.  A note at setup that the female PC had a brother who was fan of the male PC.  He showed up in just one scene.  The scene were he blew off his sister to side with the object of his fandom.  I admit I didn't have AS strong a reaction as I did to the mother scene.  But the back of mind still thought, "what a punk."<br/><br/>So, I'm totally on board that a character must face external representations of his personal conflicts and have an external impact.  I just don't think that impact needs to be very large or far reaching.  And in game setting, that it need necessarily happen over the long term.  One or two punchy scenes will suffice.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95148/#Comment_95148" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T11:35:34+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 11:35AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>What was the point on playing all that if it didn't make a difference?

My character's story wasn't about his death or the destruction of the city. It was about whether or not he, as the leader of the Knights, would be able to forge the Order into the people they needed to be in order face their coming deaths and the destruction of their world in the manner he believed they needed to. So when, after his death, his ex-lover took up his sword and took over as leader of the Order, knowing full well what would eventually happen, that was the lasting impact I was hoping for.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95151/#Comment_95151" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T11:36:43+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 11:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Emily -- yes, exactly.

RPGs are closer to television/movie/play than book in form. While in a book, it's interesting sometimes to read an internal monolouge, only the greatest playwrights have made lengthy monlouges about internal feelings not boring to the audience (see: Hamlet). Even then, we'd better see some action as a result of the internal musings, or we're bored again.<br/><br/>Point being: internal conflicts without outside effects have a strong potential to be boring time sucks for the other people at the table, and they are your audience. If RPGs are art, they're performance art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95167/#Comment_95167" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:03:45+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, the only time and scale I care about in this instance is through the end of the game.  If the action of the game doesn't change the situation by the end of the game, what the hell were you spending all that time doing?  Reveling in being someone else?  Why do you need a game or the other players for that?  If all you do is decide if your character was an asshole or not, how is that not answered by you deciding to play her as an asshole or not?<br/>As for color, did the mother or the brother have any mechanical import?  Unless I'm missing something in my reading, they couldn't.  That makes them color.  Did the things that happened to them come ad an actual result of die rolls you made, or did you fiat that mom died?  If the latter, that makes them mere color.  They were window dressing, not consequences of character intention and action.<br/>But here's the question of the thread-- when you play, do you need your characters to affect the world around them, or can you be satisfied without changing anything in the fictional world around your character?  Would a game of Mutual Decision entertain you if it didn't have anything like the mother or brother character? <br/><br/>Paul, it sounds like you scored a sort of moral victory-- that the survivors would be brave and virtuous and decent as they died out.  They wouldn't change their situation, but they would change how they approached their situation.

I only play face-to-face games, so my comments tend to reflect that prejudice. I dare say I'm not alone. Having no experience with e-mail/chat games, I can not begin to speak to them.

It's okay if it takes a long time - and even if it never externalizes. Throwing all out and having everything mapped into the fiction feels artificial (unless, of course, there's a consistent reason for it to be) and kind of Theme Park -like approach. <br/><br/>Having that conflict turn into external one after it's been brewing, either just within the character or as the case usually is, just under the radar of the characters (hinting, veiled threats, slowly bringing out the stuff and fleshing out both the character and the nature of conflict), is like finally getting to open that bottle of 15-year old whiskey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95184/#Comment_95184" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:32:30+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, I think you have the direction of causality reversed in It Was A Mutual Decision.  True, the mother's death had no mechanical effect.  But it was because of the System (and I use that in the broader use of the term to include all procedures of play that shape play: who has to frame scenes, the very fact that the game is about a breakup, what you have to write down at the beginning of the game, etc, not JUST the dice mechanics) that the mother was important and that she died.  Our "fiated" decisions were shaped, formed and facilitated by the System as a whole.  I don't think any other game would have produced that powerful a point in just two scenes.<br/><br/>As for whether I would enjoy a game of It Was A Mutual Decision that totally ignored the Friends and Family aspect (note it's a REQUIREMENT of the game that during setup you generate these NPCs), sure because I'd still be impacting the other PC.  You can't escape that in It Was A Mutual Decision.  The fate of the PCs are bound up in each other's actions.

Back in the days when playing with the classical \xc3\xbcber-god-complex GM the only things about the world we as players could in effect be guaranteed to have control over was how our characters changed internally. All the rest changed on the GMs schedule. Which was why the campaigns were the player characters intituted change in the game world were the more popular because of the tangibility of our input.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it is all about the playercharacters interacting with a world and their actions echoing through eternity. The internal change has lost its focus, until games like BW and Tsoy brought this up into our faces. So now we have overt changes of the characters combined with changes to the gameworld. Yay!<br/>\n<br/>\nThor (of BWHQ) wrote about an A-HA! moment he once had playtesting one of their scenarios. In BW you can cahnge your characters belives when you feel it is appropiate. He said back then that this is a significant moment and suggested that these momenst be played out solliloquy style (my link-fu is lazy). It was that thread that nailed it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons why this clicked so with me is that in my drama background one of the things we were taught was that if you were to find the protagonist of a movie, find the character that changes as the situation resolves.

You might or might not have visible external conflicts. If we're playing a longer game of X sessions, it usually takes first few sessions just to establish the characters, their internal landscapes, relationships to each other and the world at large. If we're playing just a one-shot scenario, it might take first few hours. <br/><br/>Getting stuff in the open and making a flying start is another option, of course - and I guess it's largely matter of playing styles (like, for example, the wheter the players are expected to play, or even the game is expected to play, in a way which maximises the change of external conflicts) and taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95202/#Comment_95202" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:11:36+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 1:12PM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>If one character outside mine had an experience that they otherwise wouldn't have had without my characters actions, then that's enough externalization for me.</blockquote>\nInteresting.

Polaris is not a tragedy.  In a tragedy, the fall of the protagonist(s) uplifts the world they live in.  Tragic protagonists are sacrificial lambs that restore the proper ordering of the world.  Check out Fortinbras taking the throne at the end of Hamlet, after the corruption in Elsinore has been destroyed, or the Montagues and Capulets coming together over the bodies of Romeo and Juliet.  Tragedy externalizes development, and "positive" development, every time-- thus creating catharsis and all that good stuff.<br/><br/>There ain't none of that in Polaris; you die, your loved ones die, and everybody else dies (or, bonus, become demons). The only thing you affect is inside the head of your character-- everything else is scattered to the winds, completely insignificant.</blockquote>\nSometimes yes, and sometimes no.  My first game of <i>Polaris</i> worked out as an <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/2006/01/07/we-wrap-our-first-game-of-polaris/" rel="nofollow">internal victory</a>, as you describe.  And, if you read the linked narrative, I found it to be quite satisfying.<br/><br/>However, I also played at GenCon with Ben and Alexis.  In this game, which played out an entire arc in about 2 hours (speed Polaris!), there was indeed positive impact on the setting.  Of course, it was the result of our characters' deaths.  In this game, Polaris didn't need to be saved.  Polaris was the problem, and we were enabling it.  My knight eventually became a demon, which actually meant that he turned his back on the atrocities that he was wreaking on everyone in a vain attempt to preserve the past.  Alexis's knight did not turn back, and she killed my knight by cutting out his son's heart and feeding it to him.<br/><br/>Then the Solaris Knight showed up, haranguing Alexis's knight.  He has been doing his best to pull down Polaris, but the Knights keep getting in the way.  Alexis's knight remained defiant, so the Solaris Knight killed her.  As she lay dying, she saw a snowdrop bloom from the snow.  The last image in the game was of the Solaris Knight plucking the flower and smiling.<br/><br/>Oh yeah.  Along the way, we destroyed two or three of the remnants.<br/><br/>So, in this case, we did leave a mark on the world.  But it was only by turning our backs on the doomed conflict...or being removed from it.<br/><br/>So, two different experiences, but both satisfying.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95204/#Comment_95204" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:12:37+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>My gut response says, "That's not a story, that's an essay."

I don't think you can have a story without external conflict.  So yes, I require conflict as well.  But I find it very interesting that your example almost mirrors exactly what ultimately happened in that very first Dogs game that I played with you alone.<br/><br/>How did that game end?  With me having a public argument with the Steward.  Perhaps you see the bigger picture that me exposing the Steward as a lazy bastard before the townspeople will ultimately have an impact on the *townspeople*.  Which is good, necessary and an excellent context for what I was doing but that's NOT where my emotional investment was.  My emotional investment was in humiliating the Steward.  Effecting change in the town wasn't where my heart was, my heart was in effecting change IN HIM.<br/><br/>Note: I think the stakes were worded as "I turn the town against him." but that's because that's how I wanted him to change.  It's pretty hard to ignore an entire group of people who used to faith in your suddenly turning on you.  I wanted to make the townspeople my weapon against him.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95235/#Comment_95235" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T14:29:00+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  2:29PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>answer the question-- do you need to affect the rest of the situation in order to enjoy play?</blockquote>\nI enjoy internal conflicts that are reflected in external elements.  For me, the answer to this question is no.  What's important to me is not how I affect external elements on account of my internal conflict, but how the external elements affect my internal conflict.<br/><br/>For example, I recently played a character whose parents had been trying to arrange a marriage for him for years, but who had resisted their efforts.  His inexperience with women and his experience of having his parents try to force one on him led to a conflict about women when he finally left home.  He had no idea what kind of women he was interested in or respected.  Having been forced out of his homeland, he was also very lonely.  So his conflict was: he wanted to be in a relationship, but he didn't know what sort of person he would be interested in.  A particular female NPC served as a foil for this conflict.  Her actions shaped his views and moved him toward resolving his internal conflict, but he never acted in such a way that would affect her life.  I would have liked to see where that went when he acted on it, but the situation as it stood was sufficient for my enjoyment.<br/><br/>In any case, I think it might help to untangle "internal affecting external" from "external affecting internal" a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95241/#Comment_95241" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T14:43:32+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  2:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's definitely (just?) a preference.<br/><br/>Mike, I have done that many times - indeed, in many genres, internal narration is almost de rigeur. Hard-boiled detective stories are typically and stereotypically done in first-person narration where plenty of commentary is done without any character in the world knowing about it other than the protagonist.<br/><br/>My fellow players often say "Hey JDC, give us some of that typewriter font narration now!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95245/#Comment_95245" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T14:54:30+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  2:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so Jesse, even if you only cared about destroying one character in that game's situation, your actions were intended to change how he related to the situation.  Yes?<br/><br/>Tangentially, at lunch it occurred to me that you might primarily or even exclusively be interested in changing how PCs relate to the situation-- even if that situation is only comprised of the PCs and their interrelationships with each other.  Yes?<br/><br/>Merten, when you say "start with a situation and internal conflicts ready to fire" (I paraphrase), I immediately assume you're talking about a situation designed to make those internal conflicts fire off -- and my technique would be to externalize them, draw thrm out, with those competing friends as in the OP or through other means.  Is this what you mean, or am I reading things into your post?  If the latter, what constitutes a situation if it's not defined by the conflicts inherent in the characters?<br/><br/>So Mark, are you saying that you approach such games as a sort of rhetorical exercise?  Is that the same as a story, or is it something similar-but-different?  I used to play a lot of World of Darkness MUSHes like this, and whole they could be exhilarating, in the end I found them lacking and over-competitive.  (JD, sound familiar?)  What's your experience with this play style, Mark?  Would it be accurate to say that your goal as a player was to change the situation in a way most amenable to the thesis you were forwarding?<br/><br/>Seth, I remember seeing the outline of that sort of story when reading Polaris.  Do you think that inversion of what young knights are told to believe is replayable?  More to the point, though, it seems your character's internal conflict was very much externalizes by thus inversion.  Did you find this any more of less satisfying than your "internal victory" game?  How were the two experiences different?<br/><br/>Paul, I'll hit up your thrrad momentarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95248/#Comment_95248" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T15:14:07+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  3:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Seth, I remember seeing the outline of that sort of story when reading Polaris.

How were the two experiences different?</blockquote>\nIs the inversion replayable?  Not sure.  It's one possible theme within the game that can be teased out, although I suppose that it could eventually run out of steam if used too much.<br/><br/>I found the two stories satisfying for different reasons, although I actually found the internal one to hit closer to home.  In the end, I saw that game (for me) being about a simple question:  "If you can't win, then why bother trying?"  And, actually, the answer to that question directly connected to my presence at the gaming table.  Na'ir's ultimate sacrifice of both life and reputation were not in vain, because I, Seth Ben-Ezra, the player at the table, remembered and honored them, and my memory and honor outlasts Polaris.  Because Polaris is gone, but I remain.  This connected to me on a personal and emotional level.  This is something that I care about deeply.<br/><br/>The GenCon game of Polaris was thought-provoking, but it didn't strike me as deeply emotionally.  Rather, it was a matter of post-game reflection, where Ben, Alexis and I laid out our respective visions of what had just happened and discussed the ramifications of our story.  Perhaps this is because I'm not horribly concerned about committing atrocities in the pursuit of a noble goal, whereas I am deeply concerned about my life and struggles having meaning in the face of a cold, uncaring world.<br/><br/>So, the primary difference between the two was the emotional impact on me of the emergent themes.<br/><br/>But, at the same time, Na'ir didn't just sit around, mooning about his life having meaning.  He <b>did</b> things.  In the climactic scene of the story, he single-handedly rallied the armies of the remnant and fought off a demon army, sweeping them from the streets and into the frozen wilderness.  This leads me to wonder if there's a false dichotomy going on here.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm not understanding what you're saying.  It could happen.  ;-)<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

Yes?</blockquote>\nThis feels *close* but like something is missing.  What I think of is to point out that I often consider certain elements of a situation to be effectively *part of* a character.  In My Life with Master my Connections are a part of my character.  Screwing with one of my Connections is more or less the same as screwing with me directly.  Similarly in that Dogs game I more or less considered the townspeople *part of* the Steward.  So I wanted to take away his toys.<br/><br/>As far as the whole of the situation being the PCs interrelationships I think this is how most GMless games work.  The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, It Was A Mutual Decision, Capes, etc.  Situation IS the PC's relationships.<br/><br/>Ah I just had a flash!  You can think of my character standing in a circle.  Inside the circle are things my character cares about.  I, as a player, care about how my character relates to those things, how those things relate to my character and how those things relate to each other.  I want conflicts and consequences to muck with those relations.  Now there are going to be things OUTSIDE that circle that may relate to things inside that circle.  I'm less concerned with these relations.  It's often cool to look at those relations that cross the boundary of the circle in retrospect (WOW, that one village is going to be screwed since we basically married off their only good farmer, or whatever) but that's usually not where I'm looking mid-game.<br/><br/>I'm a very short sighted and emotional player.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95255/#Comment_95255" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T15:39:38+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  3:39PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, I think we're pretty close to complete agreement.

Is this what you mean, or am I reading things into your post?  If the latter, what constitutes a situation if it's not defined by the conflicts inherent in the characters?</blockquote>\nQuite close, I think, but with less externalisation and - I think - less defined conflicts. As a GM/Writer, I'd pick up a setting and situtation that's likely to bring out the conflicts and seed the characters with enough stuff that will probably come out. I don't want to externalize them and draw them out when designing the characters, because that's players job and his liberty. Similarily, when playing, I need to internalize the character first, see what he's thinking and in general, establish him as a person. I'll externalize stuff when the time comes. Going straight to externalizing would render (I think, and this might be a gross generalization) the character as a playing piece I, the player, am moving through the game. I want to go under the skin of the character and move it from the inside.<br/><br/>As for situtation; I mean the general situtation (setting, relationships between the characters, etc) of the game that should be tailored to support the possible conflicts. If your game is about relationships and cheating, you want to make the game happen in a place that encourages players to do such things and characters that are likely to do such things. If you want to examine the facade's people keep up and how they fall down, you might want to set the game into a high-stress situtation where adrenaline will flow and players are more prone to act under a load of adrenalin. In short, as a designer, you want to install stuff for players to take in and turn into conflicts, and design a situation which'll help them to do that. As a player, I want to develope the conflicts myself, preferably from a sketch someone else made that'll fuel up my own creativity. I'm also more intrested in the stuff that leads into the conflict than the actual resolve, in terms of time invested. If the theme is romance and some kind of choice (say, wheter I want to go on with my current relationship that's safe but mundane or ditch that and make out with the mysterious and exiting stranger), I want experience the things that pave the way for the conflict, because it makes the actual resolving much more meaningful. As an added bonus, it also makes me the would-be-cheater or the dull-but-honest-family-guy and makes me to deal with the emotional baggage. I'd feel that going straight to the conflict would make me an observer and that I'd be missing out something crucial.<br/><br/>Funny, I think we're again circling the same preference issues we've been circling for a long time, now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95347/#Comment_95347" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T00:33:10+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 12:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, okay I'm trying to grok from your posts the things that bug you about Polaris. I'm not sure I understand yet how Polaris is about internalized rather than externalized conflicts. I don't think there's anything forcing you to live inside your character's head in the gaem. In fact, I would say most conflicts I've seen are very externalized--fighting demons, other knights, senators, love interests. Most of the conflicts are externalized conflicts, so I don't understand your views in this context.<br/><br/>I think I do understand your views on the character having a lasting impact on the fictional world, which is a different issue. I think the characters in Polaris can affect their worlds to great degrees and make sweeping changes. They just can't change their ultimately tragic fate. I know this bothers you. It does not bother me. The character creates a lasting impact in the one place it matters most to me, inside my head. That is where the character lives on. I don't care if the fictional story ends with my character riding off into a fictional sunset happily ever after. I care about the shared experience of playing the game and the shared memory of those experiences. That's where the Catharsis occurs.

I have a hard time seeing why I should care if my actions had a real, lasting impact in-game.  It's not as though there is some real stake in whether the villain is <i>really</i> defeated.  For the most part I care about the journey more than the destination.  <br/><br/>Now, I like action to be occuring within the game -- interactions are what it's all about, in particular.  However, those actions / interactions have an impact on the inner life of my character -- they're usually not a mirror of it.  <br/><br/>In a novel or play, you're identifying with a protagonist that someone else is controlling.  Thus, the author needs to externalize in some way in order for you to understand the inner conflict.  But role-playing isn't like that -- you're authoring your own character, so you don't need those same devices to understand your PC.  That PC still needs action and interaction to have satisfying dramatic change, but it doesn't need devices like soliloquys or mirrored externalization or whatever in order for it to come across.  The contrast of the two is something I discuss in an essay of mine:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/narrative/paradigms.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Story and Narrative Paradigms in Role-Playing Games</b></a><br/><br/>That said, I did enjoy just fine doing a long campaign of Buffy where everything was symbolic externalizations of inner issues.  However, I also enjoy campaigns that aren't this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95445/#Comment_95445" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T10:09:13+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 10:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, Mark, it seems to me like you are ignoring the looming doom in favor of your character's immediate world.

A schism that has been bubbling under for a long time can suddenly turn into a conflict if opportunity arises.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>If so, what happens if nobody "bites" and takes one of those opportunities?

Several sessions can go on without apparent conflicts, would-be-conflicts from where someone backs out (which might be a resolve in itself), or just things bubbling under. It might be different with a one-shot game; if they need a conflict, the session is usually designed in a way that the conflict is very hard to avoid. Though if it does happen, that's fine - consistency and just exploring the characters is considered to be more rewarding by the players in my experience. <br/><br/>I sometimes get feedback from my players that I'm driving a bit too hard towards the point where things tend to become external (usually by adding some kind of pressure); they tend request a slow start for a game that lasts more than few session, and then to spent at least the first session just to establish their characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95505/#Comment_95505" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T12:01:00+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 12:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>First off, are the things that Mark and James are talking about sound accurate to your own experiences?</blockquote>\nYes.

It does not bother me. The character creates a lasting impact in the one place it matters most to me, inside my head. That is where the character lives on. I don't care if the fictional story ends with my character riding off into a fictional sunset happily ever after. I care about the shared experience of playing the game and the shared memory of those experiences. That's where the Catharsis occurs. That's where what happens in the game has an effect.</blockquote>\nYes.  This.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Secondly, it sounds like a big part of your experience is in your role as audience to your characters' exploits.  Is it accurate to say that you find your characters' actions and beliefs laudable regardless of their consequences in the game?  That your standard is external to the causality of the game?  The character was good/noble/chivalric/decent because of what he did, rather than because of the results he got?</blockquote>\nYes, my standard is external to the causality of the game, and it is the application of this standard to the events of the story that is a vitally important part of the experience for me.  This cuts both ways.  I can say that Na'ir was noble, even though ultimately he didn't save Polaris.  Conversely, when playing a <i>Dirty Secrets</i> game, I can pass my own judgment on the characters, <i>including the investigator,</i> regardless of the specific outcomes of the story.<br/><br/>This is similar to my experience of any other form of story.  I usually engage in "post-story" reflection when finishing a movie or a book.  Indeed, I think that this is a skill that we gamers would do well to cultivate.<br/><br/>This doesn't exclude other reasons for enjoying roleplaying.  To give an analogy, I enjoyed <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> because of the story which illustrated the folly of two women, and I appreciated the narrative impact of the various fight scenes which also managed to provide plot and character exposition.  But I also thoroughly geeked out on the <i>wuxia</i> style martial arts fighting, too.

I always know that that character is ultimately doomed, and it adds a different color to everything the character does. Every victory is tinged with the sadness of defeat. Every defeat is tinged with the question "is this the act that bring about the end? Or will it be the next one?" The doom does not directly effect the decisions of the character, that is true. The character is not aware that doom is certain (although having them suspect it woudn't be bad). That's called dramatic irony;  the audience knows something that the protagonist doesn't. It colors everything the audience sees.<br/><br/>I am struck by something I heard today in Rosh Hashanah services, about a man who was told he had a year to live and kept a journal of that year, showing how his life changed. He watched less TV, as an example.  He spent time with his family. He did not ignore his ultimate doom, he focussed on it and his life was filled with meaning.

In roleplaying, each player tends to view their PC as the central character in a bigger story.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Internal conflict is externalized by putting the behaviors and motives that the internal conflict creates into conflict with another character.

They may not ever, and when they ever do, odds are that fulfillment will be a brief and fragile spark in a huge universe. I will live and die in a world of violence, oppression, and exploitation. That does not keep me for working for peace, justice, and freedom.<br/><br/>They are still worthy things to believe in and work toward. Even if I fail. Even if what I do ultimately could be seen to have set the "cause" back in the end, because I don't have the luxury of that omniscient perspective. Even if I am <i>wrong</i>.<br/><br/>That's why a game like <i>Polaris</i> appeals to me. Because it lets me play around with a fictionalized, distanced, <b>safe</b> version of the question: "What if it's all for nothing in the end?

Does failure rob the action of meaning even if success was possible?<br/><br/>Moral absolutes: Wow! I was going to reject your notion about moral absolutes playing a role in this discussion. But I think you're not far off the mark here. Its not a coincidence that Seth and I are lining up on the opposite side from you in the question about Polaris and meaning. I was having a real hard time getting why Polaris seemed to bug you so much and me not so much. Is Polaris somehow antithetical to moral relativism? I don't think so. I don't consider myself a moral absolutist, but I search for meaning outside of myself and my actions. However, if a use-efficacy rule is the only test for meaning, I can see why Polaris wouldn't work. I'm finding these thoughts intriguing.

The two main characters of an It Was A Mutual Decision game are profoundly different at the end of the game than at the beginning of the game and that difference is the direct result of their interactions.  But the difference (measured largely in life-style changes, job choice, living arrangements, choice of friendship, etc) doesn't appear to be large enough to register on your emotional radar.<br/><br/>In Polaris so long as the doom isn't *RIGHT NOW* there is plenty of room to make profound changes.  Today a mother appreciates her son when yesterday she disdained him.  A man got the chance to taste the kiss of his lovers lips before being executed when he otherwise wouldn't have.  A son showed his father he wasn't a coward.  <br/><br/>It's about the microcosm of immediate human experience and the inherent poetry within.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95688/#Comment_95688" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T17:23:11+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  5:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And Jesse, Mutual Decision gives me an absolute consequence that I cannot avoid.

To play devil's advocate, I think the problem lies in the fact that in Polaris the whole of the icy world melts away and no one is left who benefited.

It's that I cannot understand human emotions unconnected to other humans.  It's all one vast network.  Making one part better makes the whole thing better.  Making the whole thing better makes one part better.<br/><br/>Mark, I'm really not so sure how to respond to the fourth-wall-breaking, there.  That seems to shift the game outside of roleplaying (in which the primary activity is playing a role) and over to story telling (in which the primary activity is telling a story).

Is she only meaningful because she has impact on those who continue on? Does she have no meaning in and of herself? And if she has no inherent meaning, how can keeping her in a metal box be sadistic?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95767/#Comment_95767" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T21:59:18+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  9:59PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, if somebody keeps me alive in a metal box for six months and I can't interact with anybody else, please, please: shoot that person in the head for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95768/#Comment_95768" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T22:10:06+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 10:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!
