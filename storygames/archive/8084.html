And what about the game supports the CA (just a couple of examples)? I would gather these are games like Storming the Wizards Tower.</blockquote>\nEverybody always think about character fighting when they hear "gamism". But gamism (step on up), as every other creative agenda, is not about the characters: it's about the PLAYERS. You can have a gamist game where the characters are sitting around telling stories (1001 Nights) but the players are competing with each other, and you can have a game with  very detailed rules about killing other characters with swords (Riddle of Steel) where the players are doing story now.  <br/><br/>The mapping 1:1 between character and player objectives (the character want to win---&gt; the player want to win) is only an habit of a lot of traditional rpgs, not a rule.<br/><br/>A more "traditional" example of step on up than 1001 Nights could be AGON.<br/><br/>The best answer about how they support gamism would be playing them, I think. It's difficult to talk about these things without a base in actual play.\n<blockquote>2) Same question as 2 for Story Now (Sorcerer?) and the Right To Dream.</blockquote>\nThe list of coherent narrativist games would be very long...  most of the games talked about in this forum are narrativist.  Citing only the ones that (in my opinion) best explain the way they are to be played, I would suggest you try Dogs in the Vineyard, Spione, Primetime Adventures. Sorcerer has very good explanations about narrativism, but they are in the supplements, not in the core book, so to read it you read all of them (Sorcerer, Sorcerer and Sword, Sorcerer soul, Sex and Sorcery)<br/><br/>An example of a "Right to Dream" game would be "Pendragon". Another would be "Dead of Night" or "exoterrorists" or "unknown armies". Many of the traditional rpgs tend towards simulationism.\n<blockquote>3) Can the Right to Dream exist without Story Now? In other words if there is no setting or backstory does (or can) the CA drift from Story Now to Right to Dream?</blockquote>\nThis phrase has no sense.  The presence of setting and backstory is totally independent from the creative agenda. You can have a narrativist game with a monstrous setting build in forty years of publications in thousand of pages (Heroquest in Glorantha) and you can have simulationist games without any setting.<br/><br/>NOTHING in the fiction, in the setting or in the shared imagined space can affect the Creative Agenda. The creative agenda is about what THE PLAYERS do. Not the characters. <br/><br/>Seeing that you choose to play "story now" OR "The Right to Dream", saying that you can have both is like saying that you can stop and don't stop at the same time, or that you can go north and south at the same time.\n<blockquote>4) Are there games design to support intentional drift? (Example: Step on Up drifting to Story Now)?</blockquote>\nSomeone tried, I think. Nobody could, of course. Drift is something people do to game texts, not something that game texts do to people. Can a game decide to play people?<br/><br/>There is a way of course to force drift: make a game unplayable, so that people are forced to change it to play. But you can't force a specific drift, the moment the players say "to hell with this, we are changing these rules" the rules have no power over them.\n<blockquote>5) I am going to put this in terms of Burning Wheel and see if I have this correct.</blockquote>\nI don't know burning wheel enough to answer this. (and the next question is too complex for me)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178241/#Comment_178241" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-11T20:41:16+00:00" title="November 11, 2008  8:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2008 8:44PM by akooser.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno,<br/><br/> Thanks for your responses.

I don't understand this super well, but there's Simulationism, which is all that "Right to Dream" stuff, and then there's "exploration" which is all the normal exposition of setting, interacting with the fictional game-world, and the way the fiction of the game becomes the "rules" of the game, that happens in (almost) all roleplaying games.  I'm not sure on the current state of the theory, but I believe that Simulationism is often confused with exploration, and the two can look very similar.  I think it's one of the reasons that no one really "gets" Sim play on a theoretical level, even though it's a very popular mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178262/#Comment_178262" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T01:36:17+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  1:36AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bah, my answer is 3000 characters too long this time.

The thing that seperates exploration from the right to dream is very much the right as in getting it right.  So the priority in Simulationist play is making play match up with a preconceived notion of what this simulation is about.  It includes things like choosing mechanics that make combat "realistic" or the idea that the group of characters will be doing certain things like investigating mysteries and it frequently includes an expectation of the morality of the characters.  This conflicts with the other modes because the preconceived notion of what play is about often doesnt match up with the other two modes desire to shape the point of play while playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178328/#Comment_178328" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T09:42:39+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  9:42AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2008 9:43AM by komradebob.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it's true: Simmers are bad people.<br/><br/>I try and try, but I just can't quit the habit.<br/><br/>The truth is, I really do come for the Play-Pretend, and all of the little challenges and human-condition dilemma-answering is truly, at absolute best,  spices added to the recipe and not the main ingredient.<br/><br/>Joking aside, sim play might also contain a strong element of reflecting off pre-existing info ( keeping in mind that the info might be pre-existing only for an extremely short amount of time, like ten minutes ago).<br/><br/>As for why folks don't get it at a theoretical level, I put that solidly on the fact that the early theorizers were jazzed up about creating stuff to support the other two named Agendas, and mostly let poor old Sim muddle along in the hands of other folks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178377/#Comment_178377" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T13:36:09+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  1:36PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ara, regarding your #5:<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't played BW yet, I've only read it, but I think I can address this through BW terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeliefs, Instincts, and Character Traits are Positioning.  Die Traits and Call-on Traits <i>include</i> Positioning, but are also Effectiveness.  The fact that you <i>have</i> a relationship with a given character is Positioning, but the score attached to it is Effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe amount of damage you can sustain is a Resource.  Whether or not your "Resources" score is Taxed, that's also a Resource.  Whether or not you are Taxed from performing sorcery is a Resource.  Whether your weapon is in your hand or not is a Resource.  Basically, a Resource is anything that powers the character, such that its presence allows things to be done, and its absence disallows.  Like a battery.  When the battery runs dry, the thing it powers can't operate.  In some games, the degree to which the "battery" has run down also has an impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nEffectiveness, in BW, is represented by the stats and skill scores, as well as the Circles and Resources scores, the various properties of your weapons, Die Traits, and Call-on Traits.  Effectiveness is anything that impacts the degree of effect the character's actions can have.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all games, there's always some manner of exchange rate between Positioning, Resource, and Effectiveness.  In BW, using a Call-on Trait converts Positioning to Effectiveness.  The Relationship mechanics are also examples of converting Positioning into Effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178389/#Comment_178389" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T14:41:39+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  2:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall,<br><br>   Thanks!

I've seen arguments for designs that "get out of the way," but that isn't the same as designing without clarity. Unclear design is just bad design. Clarity means knowing what you want your game to do, making that obvious to players (or, alternatively, making it hard to play any other way), and cutting out stuff that distracts from that vision. It's <i>fine</i> to include tools and techniques that might not work well together -- perhaps they support different CAs -- but the designer has to make it clear which work together and which don't. If you design a game that supports two or three CAs with different tools, and you don't make it very easy for the player to choose the right tools to "hit" the CA they want, players will have to figure that out on their own. That's not the worst thing in the world, but it isn't good design, either.<br/><br/>I expect a couple of the usual characters here to get in my face about something I said, and I'll have to remind them that I didn't actually say that. &lt;=) Please read what I said charitably.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178508/#Comment_178508" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T08:23:34+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  8:23AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I totally misread your question.

Character components have, in the past, been strong indicators of support for one CA or another, but I see no reason it has to be that way.  Here are some ways character components can support one CA or another, though:<br/><br/><b>Sim</b> games often get into the details of a character as they relate to the setting. During chargen, the game should give the players choices about how they want to connect to the game in the "right" way. "Rightness" can be genre faithfulness or "realism," or even fidelity-to-system. Look at the chargen additions in AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, which added a non-weapon proficiency system (the precursor to 3E's skill system), which expanded upon 1st Edition's vague "occupation" rule in the DMG. Making characters "more realistic" (or more genre-faithful) is just one kind of Sim thing, but it's a very common kind of Sim focus, especially when that fuzzy thing people call immersion is a desired result. Other cool approaches to Sim design via character generation include:\n<ul>\n<li> R. Talsorian's <i>Cyberpunk</i>. Note the roles/classes aren't that restrictive, but are more color, and see how the skills slot into the game. Also check out the Lifepath system.<br/></li><li> <i>GURPS</i> and a lot of other "generic" systems. These tend to have plug-ins for different genres that help slot a character into the world better.<br/></li><li> <i>Vampire</i> and many of the other Storyteller games. Obviously, these games are chock full of awesome color and setting, and the chargen rules plug straight into all that goodness. Splat books offer additional chargen options that expand the setting, too. <br/></li></ul>\n<b>Gamist</b> games should present the players with options that let them show competence and skill ("step on up").  A player of D&amp;D 4E who doesn't make smart (optimal) decisions during chargen might end up with an ineffective character, and the entire party could suffer. Good gamist rules do offer choices that are suboptimal (so the players learn to avoid those), and might also offer clever combinations of things that seem at first to be suboptimal, but turn out to be quite effective. Look at Magic: The Gathering which, while not a role-playing game, offers a lot of good lessons to a Gamist designer. Note that Gamist games don't require competition among players (4E doesn't, really, except perhaps between GM and players, and even that is arguable). <br/><br/><b>Narrativist</b> games often front-load thematic choice. This helps players get to the core of the game where they are getting at the issues that are important to them (the "address of premise").  A lot of Narr designs give players broad freedoms about character creation, like using freeform traits instead of a skill list, but this isn't a requirement and freeform traits alone do not a Narr game make. It helps to get a player to figure out what the core issues of play will be at the time he or she creates the character, so a lot of Narr games do that. <i>Sorcerer</i> popularized the idea of a Kicker, a player-authored situation that jump-starts play and kicks it in the direction of address of premise. Also look at that game's Price attribute; it starts the player thinking about the game's overall premise ("what will you do for power?").<br/><br/>So that answers the first part of your sixth question, I think. Figuring out how dissonance between character creation rules design and a group's CA or even the rest of the rules text is a thought experiment, and also the subject of many Actual Play reports here and on the Forge.  Here are some examples from my own actual play, though.<br/><br/><b>D&amp;D 3.5...</b> I ran a 3.5 campaign. I wanted to drift the game to Narr, and it's a fairly strong Gam design. Despite my addition of some rules designed to reward players for addressing premise (find my "Character Bonds" rules), the game kept "course-correcting" back to Gam play by rewarding Narrativist play with Gamist options (level up! get more cool fighty powers!). This led players towards play that let them step on up, and they stopped addressing premise, because it was more fun in that game.<br/><br/><b>Dogs in the Vineyard...</b> I played in a game at a convention. Everyone but one player grokked the kind of play we were going for. She wanted immersion (which is fine in Dogs) at the expense of premise (which is not). It was painfully difficult to get her to make choices that mattered to anyone else at the table. She seemed to want to just "be there," experience the world, and talk about details of her character that we felt were superficial. For example, she spent about two minutes of her character's initiation scene (which is part of chargen in Dogs) talking about how blue her eyes were. There was no conflict, and it was difficult for our GM to get to a conflict. The rest of us were dreadfully bored.<br/><br/><b>AD&amp;D 1st Edition...</b> I was running a campaign with a strong Sim focus. I did a lot of house-ruling and DM-overruling to keep things "realistic," especially during combat. One day, Matt's thief character encountered a full-grown grizzly bear. He felt it was a very easy encounter, but I had done a little research on bears, and understood how dangerous they are. I used typical stats out of the Monster Manual but I had the bear charge and ruled that (with a successful hit roll) the bear had knocked the thief down. This put the character at a serious disadvantage that led to the character's death. A heated argument ensued. Matt was treating the game like a wargame of sorts; he didn't particularly care for these injections of "realism" (Sim) into his well-planned tactical (Gamist) game, especially once his character died. (Of course, this is my take on the matter some twenty years later.) I'm not sure that gets to character components as well as my other examples, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178531/#Comment_178531" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T10:39:54+00:00" title="November 13, 2008 10:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ara,<br/>\n  I am a GNS noob much like you, but I think I can help with some of the confusion:<br/>\nRe: #2 &amp; 3<br/>\n  Story Now is a game that is about conflict and making tough decisions. Ron said he wrote TrollBabe as an example of a game that supports Story Now perfectly. Looking at the game you can see that the challenge/competition element is almost non-existent. And the character can't really explore the setting without being confronted by the need to choose to side with either humans or trolls.<br/>\n  I think Right to Dream games are ones that are either like Star Trek where the characters behaviors are predictable even in a thematically confrontational scene or ones that are thematically agnostic (such as Gurps). The point of play in these games is not to push a theme or compete with each other, but to explore the SIS together and see what comes out. In one sense, I wonder if Pendragon is Right to Dream. I mean, the actions of a Knight of the Round should be fairly predictable (if not gut wrenching), yet, it is still fun to experience that setting and genre, no?<br/>\n  So, I think its pretty easy to have Right to Dream without Story Now and vice versa. And I am not sure how you could have both, if I understand them correctly. Right I mean if you are totally in that Right to Dream headspace, then a thematic conflict might even pass unnoticed and it you are in Story Now mode, you might not be able to enjoyably explore issues that don't fit your perceived theme.<br/>\n<br/>\nRE: #6<br/>\n  I think that chargen can support/hurt a CA. I think you can see this in some games from the 90s. Games where chargen is generic, but the setting is thematic or vice versa might be a good example. I think CP2020 might be a game that wants to be Nar, but the chargen is maybe more Gamist and the mechanics are more Sim. I don't know. Again, my understanding is right around the same level as yours, so if I am wrong, please point it out.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178562/#Comment_178562" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T12:28:36+00:00" title="November 13, 2008 12:28PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>Story Now is a game that is about conflict and making tough decisions.</blockquote>\nThis is not what was intended by the phrase Story Now.

By predictable I didn't mean that the characters were static or robotic, but that if you confront a Star Trek character with a moral dilemna, you can usually guess the solution that someone playing "in character" will pick. The dogma of the setting prescribes acceptable actions and the "fun" comes after the characters respond to the gut-wrenching situation. Not from the situation itself. Like if a Star Fleet officer has to decide between saving one person or a million, the answer is one million and one. And they will die trying to get both of them. Where as a Story now gamer might revel in the choice itself I think. And other Right to Dream games also have this thematic neutrality (again, like gurps) but it comes from the mechanics themselves, not so much from the setting, right?<br/>\n  Its sort of a "is the journey about the trip there or the destination," its different for different people, no?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178576/#Comment_178576" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T13:34:30+00:00" title="November 13, 2008  1:34PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to jump in for a second.

The one is how the character relates to the game or to the fiction of the game (I think that this is what is called positioning). The other components describe how the player (possible through the character) can affect the game or the fiction.<br/><br/>The components that define the character's relation to the game is stuff like: Character goals, relations, personality, occupation, levels, hit points etc.<br/><br/>The components that define how to affect the game is: skills, stats, ability, feats etc.<br/><br/>Stuff like trait (as in Dogs in the Vineyard), seems to be a combination of the two.<br/><br/>How I see this relating to CA is as following: The player use some methods and technique to provide input to the game. Over a period of time the "game" will then, based on that input, give some output back to the player. It is that output that is important for fulfilling your CA. A Gamist want the output to show how their position, compared to the challenges they face, have changed. A Simulationist want the output to reinforce his understanding of the fiction of the game. A Narrativist want the output to challenges his character to make decisions that relates to the premise of the story.<br/><br/>Components like Ability and skills are all input devices, and therefor don't really have anything to do with CA. There are some methods of input that will get you faster to the fulfillment of your agenda, and is therefor preferred, but is does not in anyway define a AC.<br/><br/>Components that relates your character to the fiction, can on the other hand be very important, because it is part of what that describe the output of the game (For example levels in DnD).<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
