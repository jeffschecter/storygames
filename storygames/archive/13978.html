I'm considering allowing the antagonist player (there's only one) a benefit that would allow them to end a scene at their choosing. The next scene would then be framed as per the normal rules. They would have to earn the ability and after they spent it, would have to earn it again. And, it's not easy to get this benefit. <br/><br/>What kind of stories, scenes, or moments do you think this would provide? How do you think it would be meta-gamed? What would that do to the story? Would this cut down on the fun? Is this just a mechanic for the sake of being a mechanic?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316726/#Comment_316726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T12:10:41+00:00" title="March 15, 2011 12:10PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of giving them the power to end a scene flat out, perhaps cutting off other players, what about giving them the power to initiate a flashback or flash-forward.

I'm also wondering if it would work so that the antagonist could escape the protagonists or current situation or even holding the threat of an ended scene over the other players. <br/><br/>I'm merely interested to try it out as an experiment. I find it interesting that it's up to the other players to frame what happens next though.<br/><br/>Thanks for the replies so far!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317043/#Comment_317043" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-18T04:53:47+00:00" title="March 18, 2011  4:53AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any reason why this power couldn't be usable by both sides?

Ending the conflict on your own terms seems like a good player-focused approach for that type of mechanic. <br/><br/>That said, it might be horribly inappropriate for your particular design.
