So sorry if things get jumbled, I make up new rules or change them, or if things look really disorganized.<br/>2) I'm pooped out on creating Solid Awesome Perfect Feedback Voting systems, after a few years of Game Chef and especially Indie RPG Awards. So please forgive, again, if things look sloppy, disorganized, etc.<br/><br/>For now, I have no clear idea of how many threads will shake loose... perhaps 10? 15?  But I want to start a group voting thing on what you all should be moved out of its current category and be placed in the "Best of Story Games" category.<br/><br/>The Best of Story Games category, at its heart, is:<br/><br/>The place here where you go and thumb through to recharge your gaming batteries and get new ideas.<br/>The place filled with threads that just flipped your mind.<br/>The place where you can point to this category to an outsider, and say, "This is basically why Story Games is awesome."<br/><br/>As for which threads can be nominated, I ask the following:<br/><br/>* For now, please only nominate threads that were <b>created</b> sometime in 2006 (even if they're still being posted to today).<br/>-- I just want to try that year to see what shakes loose.<br/>-- Once the threads are picked, it's not like that year is closed or whatever: In future votes, threads from 2006 will be eligible then as well.<br/><br/>* The threads can be as general or specific as you like. It could be a general thread on "making games better", or a thread you loved about new tricks for a specific, existing game. Whatevah.<br/><br/>* Only pick the threads that really meant something to you. Think about the ones that you liked, personally. Don't think about the ones that "should be in that category for the Greater Good", or that show off the community or whatever. Just go with what you liked.<br/><br/>Here's how this thing works:<br/><br/>0) Nominations go in this discussion thread.<br/>1) Nominate up to around five discussion threads. Just one is fine, too. There's no hard limit. 3 is sensible. 5 is fine. More than 5 is ok too, if you can clarify why you think they are awesome. Please no more than 10 for now.<br/>2) You can edit or re-edit your post anytime.<br/>3) If someone posts a thread that you also think should be nominated, you can do one of the following:<br/>---a--- Say "I second (user's) nomination for her <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> thread" or the like.<br/>---b--- or: Second the thread, and provide <i>your own</i> reason for why you like it.<br/>---c--- but note:<i> This doesn't mean that you have to read everyone else's nominations</i>!. You can ignore the other posts and just post your own nomination for your own reasons, even if its the duplicate of someone else's. I don't want to force everyone to read through a ton of other suggestions just in order to post their own.<br/>4) Post your nomination in this format:<br/><br/><b>NOMINATION NUMBER</b>  (1-10: Just the number of your nominations, not the number of the nomination in relation to others in the thread.  This is so I can refer to them as "Andy's #4", "Jason's #2", etc)<br/><b>THREAD URL</b> (you don't have to make it linked/linkable)<br/><b>REASON:</b> , followed by the reason for the nomination.<br/><br/>Here is an example (They area from recent 2007 threads, so it's not a real nomination, but the format is the same):<br/><br/>================<br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> <br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2910" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2910</a><br/>Reason: This thread really breaks down the history of mystery, and gives tips on how to use mystery in your games.  A great read, filled with lots of ideas!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2982" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2982</a><br/>Reason: This thread kicks ass. It is all about making regular games more player-collaborative. How to take that "story games" hippieness and apply it to regular RPGs.<br/><br/>(etc)<br/>================<br/><br/>What happens after that?<br/>Good question!  What I will most likely do is, after a few weeks, hand pick about 10 of those threads to go into the Best Of area, and then have a vote-off for 10 more.<br/><br/>Then, we'll do the process again in a few months, but this next time it will include threads from 2006 and 2007. After that, we'll just do this kind of vote-off once every 8 months to a year, and it will be for All Threads from All Years, people can nominate whatever they wish.<br/><br/>Questions? Feel free to ask. Otherwise, dig through your bookmarks and nominate away!<br/><br/>This voting thing may end early if we have a ton of great suggestions, but for now I'm planning on leaving it open until about July 1st.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast" title="Radaghast"><img alt="Radaghast" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/252/nT6IX77SIXBAG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast">Radaghast</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70171/#Comment_70171" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:21:16+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:21AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2007 9:21AM by Radaghast.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            #1<br/>\nhttp://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2495<br/>\nReason: it's *the* Reversed Mantras thread, and it kicks ass in so many different ways it's impossible to describe here.

There were loads of really cool ideas and the seeds of at least three of four distinct games on the same subject. It addressed the starship as a community, and how best to handle the mechanics of a community, taking several different approaches. I hope one (or all) of those games gets made.Great stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74722/#Comment_74722" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-09T16:06:18+00:00" title="June  9, 2007  4:06PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Threads you started?
