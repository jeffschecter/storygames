It's a fantasy one-shot RPG (although could be extended to multiple sessions). <br/><br/>The system is based off of something else I've been working on for a while, but this version hasn't had a playtest yet; if anyone has any general feedback in the meantime, I'd be grateful. Many thanks - over to you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
