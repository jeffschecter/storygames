The setting we started out with isn't the same as the setting we end up with after some hours + bottles of wine. <br/><br/>One of the functions of a GM is to keep the vision - theme, setting etc - coherent during the game. If players start getting silly, or suddenly forget the existence of entire countries or laws of nature, the GM can get things on track again, usually by blocking unwanted input &amp; reminding everyone of specific elements of the vision.<br/><br/>Perhaps GM-less games need to take care of this function, for example by giving one player (possibly on rotation) the responsibility of keeping the vision intact? With the mandate to block/silence/correct/reframe "wrong" statements?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89658/#Comment_89658" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T04:30:23+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  4:30AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play in a long running GM-less game with my house mates. We actually have a very strongly established world (that predates my involvement with the game), with it's own rules, laws and whatnot. While our game has no rules in the traditional sense, the things you talk about (vision, theme and setting) are all safe guarded and protected by the players without the help or need of a GM. The purpose and point of the game varies from player to player, but one of the things I think we all agree on is that the game isn't just about playing roles and telling stories, but about building, growing and exploring this fictional world.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo this end, we tend to police ourselves when it comes to unwanted input. When one player suggests something that just doesn't fit, the other players are quick to say so. Sometimes (often) we can make it fit. Sometime we can't. We always discuss why. This works for us, becasue this is how we've decided to play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been telling people who want to play GM-less Panty Explosion that the key to making it work is to set down befor ethe game and talk about what you want. What kind of stuff do you wnat in the game.What do you not want? What kind of tone would you like to set? What kind of themes and ides do you want to explore? Coming to an agreement ahgead of time puts everyone on the same page and avoids many of the problems that can sometimes come up in GM-less play.\\<br/>\n<br/>\njake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89666/#Comment_89666" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T05:03:18+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  5:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually enjoy that drift, Matthijs.

If the people at the table don't respect his guidance, the rules can't help him. Because the rules can't force a player to act in a specific way or to take anything seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a player has that social authority, he doesn't need to be the GM. He can enforce it even as a player.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this happen in many groups, where the "guardians of the game integrity" are the oldest players, or the "alpha GM", and not the one that is GMing in that moment.  Because this role, and the role of the "npc player" are completely different and can be done by different persons. And this role exist in one or more persons enen in GM-less games.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a very good thread about this, follow this link:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22268.0" rel="nofollow">You've Landed on Gaming Group "Park Place", Pay $15 Rent</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89705/#Comment_89705" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T07:19:19+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  7:19AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs,<br><br>I'm intrigued with this, but also confused too.<br><br>The "vision" at the table can only exist in what is expressed through play, right?  Everything else before play is, "Well, it's kind of like this," or, "It should feel like this."  But other than that it's not concrete yet.  Yes?<br><br>So, could you give some examples from an actual game so I can get a better idea of what you're talking about.  Because, as Jason says, staying true to the vision is also blocking input.  But in a lot of games one of the <i>points</i> is to engender input.<br><br/>I'd add, and I'd like to see if this is born out in actual play, that I prefer GM-ful rather than GM-less as the valid term.  One suggests that we're all out having a great day at sea on a lovely 19 foot boat -- <i>with no one ever holding a hand to tiller!</i>  I don't think that works too well.  <br/><br/>I think the group is responsible for all stepping up to the task at hand of moving the game forward.  Consensus building and more, in moment of play, all insure that the fun heads in direction we like.  We're not allowed to step away from our responsibilities just because this time no one was assigned to sheperd our fun.

Because this might have more to do with the issue than anything else (not sure, asking.)<br/><br/>Is it better to have one person up front because then we've all agreed to cede our authority to goalie the vision?  That is, there won't be any sour grapes because Suzy suddenly jumps in and questions my description because who the hell is she, she's no better than me?  But if we declared Suzy the vision goalie first, I'm expecting her to jump in and correct my vision so it's no big deal when she does?  I don't know the answer to this.

Instead of giving everyone a job no one wants, or giving one guy a job no one wants, you give them something that allows them to play around, show off, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89805/#Comment_89805" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T11:14:55+00:00" title="August 23, 2007 11:14AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2007 11:15AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just so everyone knows, I cross-posted my last reply with Matthjis' last reply.

These are two different things, of course.<br/><br/>Another example from play: Years ago, playtesting one of my first GM-less (I prefer that term, just a matter of taste) games, two of the players started doing silly stuff (describing the brandings on their characters' buttocks, stuff like that). It completely broke the vision I had, and had tried to impart through the setting cards. However, there was nothing I could do about it by the rules. I ended up whining, and ultimately dropped development of the game (today, I might have done differently).\n<blockquote>At what point should we stop if we're getting tired? These games require lots of committed focus. I know I've made mistakes pushing past the point of "Okay, guys, let's wrap it up till next week." Because this might have more to do with the issue than anything else (not sure, asking.)</blockquote>\nOh, definitely; we could have stopped earlier, and had a more coherent game. However, we wanted to keep playing, even though we were a bit tired. Another point to consider: Since we'd never played Polaris before, and there was a lot for us to keep track of (new mechanics, resolution phrases, everyone's cosmos, interactions between characters), vision sort of slipped through the cracks while we were paying attention to other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89855/#Comment_89855" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T13:16:02+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  1:16PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs, I really like this.<br/><br/>We played a game of Lacuna recently.

(It's great when that's the case.) For those other times... sometimes the group will work with one person (or a few people) just stepping up and saying sometime, and the rules can help encourage that, but some groups really will not have someone emerge like that naturally - for those, having someone take the extra role of guiding vision is what's needed.<br/><br/>So, "depends on the game and group", but take that as just a starting point.<br/><br/>Personally, I occaisionally see the problem of vision drift; I therefore try to step up and offer opinions to keep the vision unified (sometimes), and try to listen really hard for others' opinions. I'd rather get *more* feedback then be saddled with something lame I just narrated in for the rest of the games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89877/#Comment_89877" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T14:00:01+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  2:00PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite> I'd rather get *more* feedback then be saddled with something lame I just narrated in for the rest of the games.</blockquote>\nI totally, totally agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89925/#Comment_89925" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T16:46:57+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  4:46PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is part of what I came up with the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3867" rel="nofollow">coolmap</a> for.<br/><br/>It starts out as a brainstorm to get everyone on the same page.
