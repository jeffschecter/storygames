As we weren't able to get all the numbers right, we decided to push our campaign toward this spring (somewhere in march). Well, it turned out to be a truly good decision. I have read recently about KickStarter campaign: when you think you are ready, add three months. So, that's where I stand. I guess I could start a campaign in January (my KickStarter page is almost done), but we will take some time to build an audience and thus, increase our chance at having a better success in all this adventure.<br/><br/>A little bit of context: ExiStanc3 is about three things: a system, <b>Shadow and Light</b>, a campaign, <b>Avalanche</b> and a <b>website</b> that allows to manage epic campaigns such as Avalanche. We've put a lot of thoughts into this about the KS campaign. Should we do one or more campaigns? What should we do first? Maybe Shadow and Light, as a small campaign? A print run of Avalanche? Just the website?<br/>Finally we've decided to present what makes us <i>unique and distinctive</i>: Avalanche and the application (after all, Shadow and Light is <i>yet another innovative </i>system).<br/><i>A quick apart\xe9: recently, we've seen a lot of applications/websites to help manage "adventures". They all have two things in common: they provide tools for the current products being sold AND they do not propose their own adventure. What makes us different: we propose a new type of product and the adventure itself.</i><br/><br/>So, we have three months to promote, sell our campaign, get people excited about this. We're going to start in January, but I'm interested in hearing from this community first. So, what do we have to propose/use as material?<br/><br/>Here we go:<br/>The <b>"poster"</b> for our promotion of our KS campaign:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/KS_Promo.png"/><br/><br/><b>Our first teaser</b>. You might not remember this, but we did this teaser a couple of years ago, but we decided to change it a little. Avalanche is vast and <i>strange</i>, so, this first teaser should be playable and presents Avalanche in a common "adventure module" way. This teaser serves as an introduction. It is a 17 pages pdf.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/Imagenewsiteweb-teaser1.png"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/ExiStanc3-Tale_of_the_dragons_hunters.pdf" rel="nofollow">You can download it here.</a><br/><br/><b>Our second teaser</b>.<br/>This second teaser is more "academic": it presents <i>our</i> vision of role playing game, the problems we have identified and the solutions we propose. It is mostly about fluff, as this is our trade, what we do. It explains how Avalanche is designed and how to use it. Also, please note that, thanks to various discussions I had within this community, we decided to present this as "what is ttrpg <i>for us</i>", with a strong bias. It is a 14 pages pdf.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/Imagenewsiteweb-teaser2.png"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/ExiStanc3-The_game_master_way.pdf" rel="nofollow">You can download it there.</a><br/><br/><b>Our third teaser</b>.<br/>Now, this is the real stuff. This is an actual extract of Avalanche, how the printed book would look like. This is what I'm kickstarting. It is not playable (meaning the extract shows a tour of Avalanche, not an adventure to be played). It is a 70 pages pdf. You like this? Avalanche, Spring, our first part of the campaign is 600 pages of this. <i>Please note that there is a little problem with the map; we will address this during the vacations.</i><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/Imagenewsiteweb-teaser3.png"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.existanc3.com/stuff/ExiStanc3-Avalanche_an_extract.pdf" rel="nofollow">You can download it here.</a><br/><br/><b>More stuff for our campaign</b><br/>We're still planning some important releases to promote our campaign.<br/>- the kickstarter page itself. It is almost done. We will be displaying it for almost three months. We have a very long and various stretches.<br/>- a promotional video presenting one of our five stories.<br/>- our kickstarter video<br/>- And, of course, we do have our website (landing page) to promote our material: <a href="http://www.existanc3.com/" rel="nofollow">existanc3</a><br/><br/><b>What's next?</b><br/>A couple of things:<br/>- We do have a strategy to be "compatible" with other systems. Mainly, Shadow of Yesterday, Savage World, Pathfinder, 13th Age, Burning wheel, FATE. Our strategy is to contact those creators/owners and commission them to produce pdf/rules/character sheets to be compatible with Avalanche. Given that, we will be targeting those communities. Just to mention, Eero is already on board for Shadow of Yesterday.<br/>- We will be targeting main forums of players.<br/>- We will be looking for reviewers and/or alpha testers. We'll have in two weeks the complete Avalanche pdf in the format shown in teaser 3. Our guess is that if you like it and play it, there are two things you would want for sure: a printed copy and a website (to help you with the massive amount of information)!!<br/>- We will be looking for bloggers; media in general. Our KS campaign will be a bit different from the others.<br/><br/><b>About this thread</b><br/>- What do you think in general of my plan and promotional material?<br/>- Would you have some advices to give me?<br/>- Are there some pitfall I don't see?<br/>- I won't be addressing "typical players forum" as I am in here. Any advices on how to present it?<br/>- Do you have some suggestions of "where" I should go with this or "people" I should seek out?<br/><br/><b>One last thing: I'm really, but really glad with the material I'm proposing here. That said, I come from a very long way and I strongly believe this would not have been possible without the people of the forge and you guys in this community. So, thanks a lot.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
