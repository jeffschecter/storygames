                    So here’s where I currently stand… with the understanding that there’s a <em>lot</em> of work left to be done before we have good safety tools, and, uh, I ain’t a licensed therapist or whatever.<br/><br/>Now… standard caveat. You start wanting to discuss safety tools to improve them and people are like “Wtf, are you against safety?!” and I’m like no, but… if they don’t work… There’s this cargo cult approach to safety tools where people never ever question them and we end up with a large katamari of safety tools that “are all, of course, in use at our table, because we Care About Safety™”<br/><br/>Well, I care about safety, too. Hence thread.
<h2 id="four-big-strikes-against-the-x-card">Four big strikes against the X-card</h2><em>(and a bonus super minor gripe with it)</em>
<ol><li>It’s not enough—people sometimes ignore you X-carding and just trample over ya</li><li>It’s not enough—sometimes you don’t dare to X-card something because you don’t want to reveal that your brother’s in prison or whatever</li><li>It’s a false sense of security—people go wild on the grimdark because they conflate a safety net with a trampoline</li><li>It’s not enough—we don’t have a time machine so there’s no real “unsaying” or “erasing” something; pretending it never happened is only going to invalidate those who’ve been harmed, not magically heal them up</li></ol><small>(The minor gripe is that conflating aesthetic content moderation tools with safety tools is elegant in some rulesets, inelegant and clunky in others, and straight-out incompatible with yet others. I would rather have safety tools work on a completely different level; like how a horror movie has the volume knob &amp; offswitch on your TV on a separate layer from the aesthetic choices made by the writer, director and editor. <strong>I have this sorted as a minor gripe because a coherent ruleset is not nearly as important as our safety.</strong>)</small>
<h2 id="lines-veils">Lines &amp; Veils</h2><h3 id="lines">Lines</h3>In a one shot or con game, lines are risky because you run in to the “don’t think about strawberries” effect where some people just start thinking <em>more</em> about strawberries.<br/><br/>Lines are good in a long campaign because over time people can internalize where the line goes. In our home game running since 2014 we do use them. Also we have a DM (yours truly) that can try to enforce them.<br/><br/>Someone proposed a work around is to make a <em>very</em> general line; like “this game is PG-13” or whatever, <em>but</em> that requires a specific understanding of the ratings system that many people might not have. Or “this is suitable for polite company” or whatever but again that’s gonna be flawed. But it’s better than nothing…?<br/><br/><b>Update:</b> I wasn't clear that lines can override prep, if they contradict.
<h3 id="veils">Veils</h3>The natural tendency of people to elide detail can be good sometimes (and bad sometimes); I don’t see a reason to fight human nature on that point.<br/><br/><strong>Actively</strong> veiling, like “let’s draw a veil on that” or “let’s fade to black on that” has a couple of minor cons.
<ol><li>It can remove agency&amp;consent if it’s not clear what a character in the veil actually consented to or actually did.</li><li>It can have a variant of the invalidating, patronizing “don’t you worry about that honey” effect (point 4 under X-card above) on someone who is being hurt by the content</li><li>It can make things shameful that aren’t meant to be shameful [uh, what that is, I’m unclear about since I’m so out of the loop with the mores of general society]</li><li>It can sometimes not do a lot. Like the offscreen act of violence in the movie <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> is still gruesome because of the power of imagination. Which is what we’ve already geared into superdrive by sitting at a table.</li></ol>If you’re careful about navigating these four cons, you might think active veiling is worth it. I tend to not use active veiling. If we don’t want a particular piece of content in the game, we don’t want it at all. I’d rather use a line. But that’s my taste.
<h2 id="break-go-a.k.a.-yellow-green-a.k.a.-o-card">Break / Go a.k.a. Yellow / Green a.k.a. O-card</h2>I can understand in theory how this can be good. <small>It’s kinda incompatible with some rulesets (“whaddaya mean you’re putting a break on this saving throw…?”) but again, safety needs go first.</small><br/><br/>Buuut…. I was a player in this robot larp and we did workshopping for a super complicated safety tool system with multiple colors and dimensions and my partner [in the larp] and I had a hard time getting it so I asked for us to keep trying the workshop exercises until we had internalized it fully which we eventually did [temporarily—I had forgotten it the next day]. And then near the end the facilitators said that if something happened beyond that, we were also free to break the game &amp; come talk to them.<br/><br/>And you know what? We ran into a completely game breaking issue <em>right away</em>, my partner and I. It was something that the multi-variant color-coded complicated system couldn’t solve (because it was something specific that he <em>did</em> need to happen in order to feel safe rather that something he <em>didn’t</em> need) but breaking the game, talking to the facilitator, sorting it out, and getting back into it with the <em>specific</em> advice in mind turned that session into an awesome &amp; memorable game.<br/><br/>Talking to each other with real language → much better.<br/><br/><i>[continued, this is a double length post]</i> </div>

<h2 id="luxton-technique">Luxton technique</h2><a href="http://briebeau.com/thoughty/2019/03/the-luxton-technique-by-p-h-lee/" rel="nofollow">This is from a post by P. H. Lee</a>. It’s a combination of safety techniques where I disagree with some and agree with some.
<ul><li>criticism of x-card (strong agree, see above)</li><li>what does the person need (kinda agree, with caveats, see below)</li></ul><h3 id="everyone-listing-traumas-triggers-before-game">Everyone listing traumas &amp; triggers before game</h3>I disagree with this. We’d be here all night if I’d get started and we’d also risk triggering each other even before thegame has actually started. Also see “don’t think of strawberries effect”. If you have a special need you are <em>allowed</em> to discuss it (carefully, so you don’t mess up other people) but not <em>mandated</em> to do so.
<h3 id="the-life-changing-magic-of-healing-through-gameplay">The life-changing magic of healing through gameplay</h3>I disagree with this.<br/><br/>I went to therapy and we did a lot of these healing roleplay scenarios where we went deep into the most traumatic experiences of all time and just sat with them and started tryna heal them and work on them and that was freaking awesome but you know what?<br/><br/>That was in the second year.<br/><br/>First year, it was all about calming ourselves down, escaping the problems, reading books, having strong perfume, using ice cubes or whatever to distract our minds until our bodies calmed down (or I guess, vice versa, to a much larger extent). We learned pages after pages of mnemonics on various and different techniques to use to get away from the problem, to not have to face it. And then in the second year, we <strong>gradually</strong> started using those techniques less and less, as we spend more and more time just sitting with the problem &amp; being with it &amp; working on accepting &amp; improving our relationship with it.<br/><br/>Most people, if they are sensitive (like I was; yes, I get that not everyone is), are in the “zeroeth year”, metaphorically speaking. <strong>Tossing them into the deep end of second year stuff is like asking someone with a freshly broken leg to start running right away</strong> because some misguided notion of “excercise is healing”. Yes, physical therapy is going to be part of recovery for you and you leg but uh, you can also fuck things up if you’re not ready for it.<br/><br/>Yes,
<ol><li><em>sometimes</em> you luck in to a role playing game session being very healing. And that is fantastic! Just don’t rely on it.</li><li>I do agree with Lee about all the ways the current (X-card, veils and the like) approach is “anti-healing” / dangerous / invalidating</li></ol><h2 id="i-will-not-abandon-you">“I will not abandon you”</h2>This is something, from <a href="http://fairgame-rpgs.com/index.php/fairgame/thread/32" rel="nofollow">an Meguey Baker post</a> that I thought was (thankfully) dead and buried but then Ron brought it up again at LinCon.<br/><br/>It’s the idea that trying to avoid hurting each other is the equivalent of “abandoning” each other.<br/><br/>It pressures people into not being aware of their own boundaries.<br/><br/>This is horrible.<br/><br/>I try to take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postel%27s_law" rel="nofollow">Postel’s Law</a> take on it though, now that I’ve become a little bit stronger after therapy. That means that if I can handle a topic or reaction, <strong>I</strong> will follow you were you want to go <em>as long as it doesn’t hurt the other people at the table</em>, but I will <strong>not</strong> expect or demand the same from you in return. It’s gonna be up to you, moment to moment, how far you want to take it.
<h2 id="other-people">Other people</h2>That brings me to something that I find a lot of these examples and techniques, from O-card to IWNAY to Luxton, can sometimes be a bit oblivous about.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/IWNAY" rel="nofollow">IWNAY</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Jill has a hard line at kids-in-danger. Robin says “The victim is a child.”<br/><br/>Jill says “Please don’t make the victim a child. I really don’t want the victim to be a child.” Robin says “I know you don’t like it, but the victim is a child.”<br/><br/>Jill says “You <em>suck</em>, Robin. And I’m still not going to abandon you.” Robin says “I know you think I suck. I know this is sucky of me to do. And I’m still not going to bail on you and your reaction to me being a sucky person right now.”</p></div></blockquote>So in this situation, how about Alice at the same table being absolutely clobbered by the topic?<br/><br/>Like, step one… <em>care</em> about the people at your table!<br/><br/>And, this goes for all the tools. Do <strong>not</strong> go “I need this scene to end with our characters hooking up or else I’m gonna be traumatized”, that’s a bullshit &amp; evil way to try override what the other player needs to feel safe. You can’t just boss people around using the Sacred Language of Safety Tools or whatever <em>if it hurts them</em>. Sometimes you have conflicting needs that you have to talk out amongst each other (or even break up the group over it). These protocol’s can’t override common sense and actually <em>caring about</em> each other.
<h2 id="stopping-the-game">Stopping the game</h2><strong>This needs to exist.</strong><br/><br/>A horror movie isn’t better because you can’t turn off the TV. I mean, it’d better in some ways (it’d ensure you’d get to the happy end or meaningful end or whatever) but not <em>overall</em> better.<br/><br/>Pausing the game, talking about things, getting on the same page… or just leaving (open door policy).<br/><br/>I can totally get onboard with seeing it as a last resort that we’d rather not go to. We (my old 00s group) used to start every session with “see you on the other side” and then speak completely in character throughout the entire session. Promising to see each other through. And, leaving a table can be very upsetting to those left sitting there. <strong>But</strong> it needs to be an option. You don’t <em>want</em> to use the safety net but you still put one out.
<h2 id="so-my-current-recommendations-then">So, my current recommendations, then</h2>This is work-in-progress af. Playing games is inherently unsafe (as is crossing the street) and we can only try to do our best.
<ol><li>Stopping the game is allowed, leaving the game is allowed, pausing the game is allowed.</li><li>Lines can be good for campaign play. Respect lines when prepping. Change modules if needed. <small>(e.g. if you have a line against sexual violence, as I do, you might change some deets around the stripped &amp; bound guy in <abbr title="The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh">U1</abbr>)</small></li><li>Check in with each other [if someone seems to clam up &amp; shut down] but not in a way that puts the person on the spot or exposes them</li><li>Respect that some peeps want their no-go stuff to be secret (maybe they’ve <em>just</em> shaken that heroin addiction or whatever)</li><li><strong>Use natural language to come up with custom safety tools for your specific situation.</strong> What do you need to happen or not happen right now? At the table, in the room, in the group as much as in the game or diegesis.</li><li>Be open to talking <em>privately</em> amongst just a subset of the group (maybe the player and a DM) if that’s what someone needs</li></ol> </div>

                            Thank you for the detailed overview and your measured reaction in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22095/narrativism-vs-traditional-techniques#latest" rel="nofollow">parent thread</a> and here -- I appreciate it. I have never given much thought to the issue and your post is a useful resource. I have much to learn. Definitely bookmarked.<br/><br/>I'd also like to apologize for my demon example in the other thread. I should not have brought up something potentially triggering at all, much less to make a point. I object to both the terminology and the conceptualization of 'gamestate' and 'canon' as used in the Klockwerk threads, but this was not an acceptable way to voice my criticism.<br/><br/>I hope none of this reflects badly on Jay or his ideas; I agreed with him right after my post, but of course this does not constitute any kind of endorsement from him at all.                        </div>

                            Really interesting thoughts! I like your recommendations so far. Have you checked out script change?  It seems to have some pretty sensible guidelines that is more in line with what you've got here. It also uses the fairly natural metaphor of a remote control, though I do like your point of using natural language to come up with custom safety tools as that will likely be the easiest thing for people to remember when things get intense.<br/><a href="https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change</a> </div>

                            This is a great post and a great discussion. I don't have a great deal of personal experience with these things, because I haven't ever encountered anything really, truly upsetting to me in an RPG (but I also am quite discriminating about what I play and with whom), and I'm usually very willing to talk about it, adjust, and so forth. As a result, I'm not sure I've ever seen a "line crossed" in a significant way with a group, which makes me not much of an authority or an expert, as far as I'm concerned. (There was one close call in my recent play history, but the group in question handled it really well by making sure everyone was on the same page, and we got through it quite admirably, just by being self-aware, polite human beings. I am very well aware that this was a rare "positive" case, and things could have been far worse, of course.)<br/><br/>I love reading about these issues and learning more about them, so we can all learn to do better. As a result, I want to thank Sandra for starting this thread and for all the careful thought and analysis she is giving the topic.<br/><br/>My personal experience has been that Lines &amp; Veils (as a preventative measure) have never seemed to be very useful, but having the concept available to the group is a nice thing - at least we can share the idea that <i>this is something we can do for each other</i>, which is already a good starting point.<br/><br/>My favourite tools so far have been discrete, positive signals at the table. I used the Support Flower (<a href="https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/</a>) at a convention, and it really added to the game. I'm not sure I find it very practical (it's a lot to look at and hard to read when someone puts their hand on it!), but with a group that was into using it together, it was wonderful.<br/><br/>My own idea was to recreate just a handful of the prompts on the Flower with hand signals that are easy to remember, but I haven't tried that technique just yet.<br/><br/>Here is a list of some support ideas and tools I found while looking for the Support Flower:<br/><br/><a href="https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dtwelves.com/gaming/safety-calibration-cards/</a><br/><br/>I want to venture a guess that "safety tools" and "support tools" become more and more important the less a group uses "out of game" communication at the table. People who are into hardcore immersive play, "anything you say, your character says," heavy GM direction, LARPing, and similar might need such tools the most. In a gaming style where everyone is constantly making commentary and asking each other questions, I wonder if the tools might be much less needed, because that constant flow of communication lessens the danger of the game going awry.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a>: Oh, don’t worry that personally I was triggered by you mentioning the demon <i>as an examle</i>; I was just saying that it would’ve been just as unsafe in either model; I mean that the “No. That is <em>not</em> happening” is equally effective or <em>un</em>-effective in either model.<br/><br/><b>Support Flower</b> I was familiar with, that and a <b>ton</b> of similar system. It falls under Break / Go above, and under X. Also runs into the similar problem as the Jill/Robin example under “other people”. The fact that it’s in the center of the table and shared by all is a really great tweak on the concept, the other people’s position is much more in your own face which is good. <small>But that also strictly restricts how you can sit. Not great for us who like to do the Danish Semi-Larp thing where the whole room is the game space. But again, that’s a minor nitpick because safety <strong>first</strong>.</small><br/><br/><b>Script Change</b> I was unfamiliar with. I don’t like the camera metaphor and it’s applied somewhat unintuitively here, these tools would do better without the metaphor because it’s just confusing.<br/><br/>It has these six tools:
<dl><dt>Instant Replay</dt><dd>It’s confusing that “share enthusiasm” [which, I’d rather talk about the game AFTER the game idk] and “clarify details”, which is great [standard “other people” caveat] are the same button</dd><dt>Rewind</dt><dd>See under X-card above</dd><dt>Fast-forward</dt><dd>See under Veils above</dd><dt>Resume</dt><dd>It’s good that only the caller can resume</dd><dt>Pause</dt><dd>This is great!!</dd><dt>Frame-by-frame</dt><dd><strong>This one is new</strong>. I need to think about it some more, seem’s really good! I’d <em>really</em> drop the camera metaphor (and change the name on it) since we want to to use it be <em>careful</em>, not reveling in the gore or whatever. When you frame-by-frame a horror movie it becomes <em>more</em> gross usually, right?</dd></dl>
I have some experience with pause/play specifically:<br/><br/>Untold: Adventures Await come with pause/play buttons in the box. To me that’s a great tool, doesn’t have the same problems as X-card etc. We sort out snags (could be content snag, rules snag) in the pause. We can only keep playing when <em>everyone</em> has their cards flipped to play. Our experience with these cards have been to remember to actually use them since we’re more likely to just <em>say</em> pause and go and then we need to keep the cards synched up with what we’ve already said; i.e. the cards break <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?SinglePointOfTruth" rel="nofollow">SPOT</a> by being redundant.<br/><br/>So to bring it back to script change.<br/><br/>I obv don’t like Rewind (for same reasons I don’t like X-card) &amp; I have some minor caveats w/ Fast-forward but removing them leads us with no way to actually <em>edit</em> content in a way that the “pauser” needs.<br/><br/>Instead of the script change I’d want there to be a tool for going “ok, careful now, here is what I need to happen… everyone ok with that?”<br/><br/>We use the “hand over head” sign to do OOC things.<br/><br/> </div>

                            By mentioning some of the ways these can be abused I didn't mean to imply that we shouldn't have safety tools. We just had a real jerk once, the /pol/ type, who came in and deliberately tried to use the safety tools to hurt everyone one else.

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>, the main feature that we used when I played with the Support Flower was the “share enthusiasm” type function (I don’t remember how it’s actually worded on the flower). I’m not even sure if we used any others!<br/><br/>It was REALLY helpful. I can try to explain why. <br/><br/>The game we were playing was intense and personal - tragedy, horror, characters at each others’ throats, issues of (fantasy) racism and horrible atrocities, etc. We were basically strangers, so it was slightly nerve-wracking.<br/><br/>When people would put a finger on the “show enthusiasm/appreciation” part of the flower, it gave us all confidence in moving forward. We could revel in the horror or the drama or whatever while a simple physical sign would still communicate “yes, I’m into this!”<br/><br/>(Without getting too graphic, there’s a parallel here to clear and ongoing consent in sexual relationships.)<br/><br/>When that dynamic wasn’t happening (maybe a scene is in progress and no one is “showing enthusiasm”), it meant that we knew to tread carefully and check in with each other, because there was the potential for a problem.<br/><br/>It just felt REALLY good.<br/><br/>tl;dr - safety tools that allow us to Break or Veil or stop things are great and important. But techniques which allow us to show appreciation, enthusiasm, and enjoyment are also really powerful. Because no one has to “remember” to use them when they’re scared or frozen or concerned - they, instead, signal a potential problem <i>by their absence</i>, which is, in a way, pretty “foolproof” (it doesn’t require people to remember any techniques or training or special tools - it happens automatically when play breaks down in any way).<br/><br/>As an aside:<br/><br/>I agree that the physical limitations of the flower are a big problem. We were only four and we still needed two on the table just so we could reach. And reading the tiny text across the table was even more challenging (especially if someone is covering it with their hand!). That’s why I would ultimately consider hand signals or something similar, instead. That you can do in almost any situation (except if you’re not looking at each other. I suppose!).                        </div>

                            Yeah, gestures, that's what we have; hand held over head means "OOC talk". could be rules questions could be safety questions. not every OOC statement is accompanied by hand-over-head but it's great when you want to make it REALLY clear.                        </div>

                            I have had one strong and unwanted experience in a game. I doubt any safety measure except involved pre-game talk would have helped. Since it was a spontaneous con scenario with mostly strangers and none of us had read the scenario, the circumstances were not conductive to intense pre-con conversations.<br/><br/>I asked about X-card elsewhere, and the conclusions were:<br/>1. It does not help against an intentionally malicious person.<br/>2. It does work as a prop for talking about limits and boundaries.<br/>3. It does not help against unknown unwanted content - typically the damage is done, no matter if the card is thereafter used or not.<br/>4. People had found it useful when they wanted to explore something, knew that there were borders, but did not know where the borders were.                        </div>

                            You're reading IWNAY in completely the wrong way. It's about a group that explicitly wants to play for the emotionally challenging content (like mine, for instance) challenging eachother and being there to take care of each other through it. So like. Exactly the opposite of what you described. <br/>IWNAY would be completely wrong for a group of strangers or acquaintances, of course, but it's designed for established, close-knit groups.                         </div>

                            This is certainly an area where there's no single ideal solution. For example, I probably couldn't do most / many hand signals. *shrug*<br/><br/>While I don't disagree with the critiques of, for example, the X-Card or Script Change or whatever, it's also important to see the forest for the trees here. Simply giving any thought to these things <i>at all</i> is a huge step forward. (I'm not arguing against continued improvement, of course.) My hands' situation aside, the thing that's most often been problematic for me in games is simply abusive GM authority. Sure, players can be abusive dicks, too, but the usual GM setup makes it much more likely to come from the GM.<br/><br/>So anything that reduces GMs' unbridled authority, and says that there is something else more important, is good.<br/><br/>Now, for someone who (understandably) doesn't like the X-Card, hearing that cons are starting to require them on every table might be really off-putting, and understandably so. While we should work with con organizers so that they can offer a wider menu of safety options, consider that the way things worked before was that GMs were literally not given any actual reasons to consider the safety of the participants in their games.<br/><br/>And when GMs start thinking about safety, sometimes—not always—they also start thinking of themselves as being bound by rules in other ways, too. Which is really the thing I most want and need for my personal gaming experience to get better.<br/><br/>But, yes: GMs need to find ways to use safety tools that are in line with each game they're running. I use X-Card sometimes, but have done other things at other times. When I ran Ron Edwards's Circle of Hands, for instance, we just had a brief pre-game talk about what the game was like, what sorts of content we did / didn't want to see, and I specifically talked about why the X-Card was <i>not</i> an appropriate tool for that game.<br/><br/> </div>

<small>Matt, you're right that propping up gestures as a universal solution was ableist &amp; shortsighted. Will do better!</small><br/><br/>For me many of the safety tools have been A. not helping, B. making it worse for <i>many years</i> now. For me the change from "no thought to safety" to "crappy&amp;rickety safety tools" was not recent. It's time to start to do better, <i>especially</i> as they're getting more widespread.<br/><br/>My experience, I know that this is such a cliché, but it's been that "we have x-card so we can go wild on the grimdark". There was this thread over at the gauntlet that asked the same question but got crickets, I think they asked the question as a sort of rhetorical trick? It's also a question that is <i>very</i> self-selecting because the window between people who are <i>into</i> going wild on the grimdark and the people who are too sensitive to even <i>speak up</i> about the problems is like sooooo narrow. It's P.H. Lee &amp; me pretty much.                        </div>

                            This is one area where I do genuinely think there is a pretty big cultural gap between USicans and Scandinavians, which makes this tough.

                            I am not onboard with that theory.

                            How much completely un-self-aware D&amp;D is there in the nordic tabletop scene? What is the ratio of that to Jeepform and similar?<br/><br/>The reason I ask is because, from my perspective, there are two totally separate strands at work in the stateside scene. On the one hand, you have indie gamers, who are heavily influenced by the Scandinavians, Jeepform, Knutepunkt, etc. and are, as you say, mostly on the same page: you have a lot of players who really want to "go wild" with the extremely dark content, but at the same time do genuinely at least try to make safety a thing, if often clumsily as you point out, Sandra. They're the folks who I think stand to gain the most from your commentary.<br/><br/>On the other hand, while I'm open to arguments the other way, completely un-self-aware D&amp;D GMs (and entire D&amp;D groups, to be fair) have been and continue to be the source of <i>so much shitty and abusive behavior</i> that it just seems like it has to be better to try to do <i>something</i> about them, rather than nothing. And since that's, like, 99% of the American tabletop scene...<br/><br/>OTOH, if 99% of the Nordic tabletop scene is also completely un-self-aware D&amp;D (or local equivalent), then forget I said anything. <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>

                            You're right that there's a heavy indie/jeep scene here and that I def have them in mind. Also because when you have a whole <i>group</i> of people improvising it gets darker than Raggi on a bad day.<br/><br/>But I'm still thinking that the un-aware-D&amp;D-scene would do better to <i>not</i> tread in the footsteps of X-card etc but instead heed my advice. Such as it is… I feel like I'm maybe 20% of the way to good safety, if that. It's patronizing to see them as "us, but five years ago" or w/e and I don't think it's accurate either. The cargo cult approach to safety that dominates e.g. the Gauntlet, we're starting to see some of that in D&amp;D space too. For example, I saw silent0siris talking about some of these CC tools on his YouTube.                        </div>

Well, that was my design. Yes, the exact luminence was carefully chosen intentionally. The intention being to perfectly balance the X and pause field.<br/><br/>Is that causing a major design flaw? For color blindness?<br/> </div>

                            It's not color blindness, it's the low contrast. As in no contrast.<br/><br/>I checked it under deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia filters, and for all of them it looked almost <i>easier</i> to see than the real thing for me.

A katamari is a whole mass or cluster.<br/>Cargo culted means that people are just aping things without thinking them through. <small>(It's, uh, kind of colonialist in origin, we need to find a better word for that.)</small><br/><br/>Like that robot larp I played in where they had like six different colors &amp; or whatever because they had picked up so many safety tools along the way that they were collapsing under their own weight and became useless.

Well, that's the beauty of the X card - you don't have to say <i>anything</i> about it. The examples you've discussed are exactly where the X card works best. If there is a prison scene and you use the X card, players may guess you have some problem with prisons. Could have been also a prison movie that you've just watched - who knows? Nothing needs to be discussed.<br/>(if discussing/opening up may be healthier for you is another matter...)<br/><br/> </div>

                            Well, the way I see it you have two basic options:<br/><br/>Option 1: You avoid any kind of bleed. You play settings that are as far from your own reality as possible.<br/>Play gonzo space hunters, play pulp pirates, chase monsters in a dungeon.<br/><br/>Option 2: You are looking for depth in character development, relations and emotions. <br/>You accept a certain level of bleed and vulnerability.<br/>You make the game as real as you feel comfortable with.<br/><br/>In the first option, you can probably avoid situations that would require the X card.<br/><br/>If you play with the second assumption, you make sure that:<br/>- you play with people you trust (enough)<br/>- set expectations &amp; boundaries in the beginning (using e.g. CATS, Microscope palette, Lines &amp; Veils...)<br/>- establish &amp; use safety tools during game play<br/>- take care of yourself and be emphatic with other players<br/>- check from time to time if everyone is OK (incl. wrap-up/feedback at end)<br/><br/>I don't see it necessarily as a "problem" if people see you are human, you have boundaries and are vulnerable.<br/>You just need to be able to take care of yourself and feel safe with the people you play with.<br/> </div>

                            I ran Good Society (the Jane Austen game) recently for some newbies (extensive D&amp;D experience, first time storygaming). Their eyes absolutely <i>lit up </i> when I introduced the X-card. They never actually used it with me, but both said they would definitely bring it back to the D&amp;D games that they ran, where they'd been having some bad experiences.                         </div>

                            The X-Card has the mixed benefit of being one of the first explicitly game-agnostic safety tools; something you could use in any game. As a result, many aggressively championed it, because the alternative was "no safety tool" and the prevalence of hurtful gaming seemed to show that an approach with no safety tools wasn't, empirically, working. It should also be noted that the use of safety tools in American convention RPG play remains minimal. Usually it isn't discussed. Thus, to the overwhelming majority of American RPG players, the concept of a safety tool remains a mindblowing innovation, something people have never HEARD of before, JD! Wow! The X-Card's one of the easier ones to explain, which makes it very attractive for convention play.<br/><br/>I don't typically use the X-Card in my play because I have enough experience and can grab onto enough authority at the table to steer things down the middle of the road. This isn't a brag and I'm not perfect but the X-Card wouldn't add to my toolbox significantly in most games. However, there is one game where I use the X-Card every time, which is Tall Pines, a game which always begins the same way: with the nonaccidental death of a beloved teenager.  Because the game can get into extremely heavy, traumatic zones almost instantly, I don't have enough time to get a read for the table and know when things are going awry. (Even in Tall Pines, you could throw away the X-Card after Act I and it would be fine.) <br/><br/>The X-Card, and all safety tools, should be deployed to supplement the abilities of the humans at the table; not every human at every table in every circumstance will benefit from the same set of tools, so it should not shock us when someone says "The X-Card is no good, it doesn't do anything for me." and someone else says "Without the X-Card I would have been in so many more disastrous situations; with it, I was able to steer my way out of them."                         </div>

I agree. Sometimes an overemphasis can be a bad thing and stunt the development of emotional resilience and the ability to navigate the social world in a healthy way. <br/><br/>Some psychologists have pointed out that the excessive focus on emotional safety and the measures being implemented to prevent emotional discomfort are essentially the opposite of techniques and behaviors that build emotional resilience and emotional well-being, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy and the like. <br/><br/>Of course, a lot of this depends on the details of how these tools are implemented, but there does seem an unhealthy obsession with emotional safety—which, although well intentioned—is likely counterproductive.  <br/> </div>

                            If you keep a puppy from ever being fed hard food, it will not experience the distress of transitioning to hard food. Also there's some evidence its teeth will never become as strong as they could have, and it will have dental problems later in life.<br/><br/>If you keep a puppy from ever being kicked, that's simply good. Puppies do not need to be kicked to develop anything they need or want later in life. Even if the kicker thinks it's an appropriate training method. The kicker is malicious or wrong.<br/><br/>If a puppy comes up to you and asks "Please when we interact would you avoid feeding me hard food and kicking me?" the first response should be "Certainly." and only after you've stopped kicking the puppy should you work to find a way to still let the puppy eat hard food.<br/><br/>It is likely that an obsession with safety will harm a puppy in a well-adjusted situation. It is also likely that an obsession with safety will hugely help a puppy who is about to be kicked-with-good-intentions. And that puppy, when hearing that you are wondering if all this safety-obsession is good for the well-adjusted puppies, may understandably and legitimately become quite cross.<br/><br/>My thesis on puppies is completed.                        </div>

                            The problem with that analogy is it is about food and physical violence. We are talking about content of interactive entertainment. I think a lot the arguments in favor of safety tools have relied on describing words and ideas as violent or harmful, and that has made people reluctant to voice disagreement with them. But just looking at the result, my inclination is to say it has been more harmful than good to develop a culture centered around safety tools and obsessed with safety.                         </div>

I guess what I am saying is it seems to me like our focus on safety tools and safety (not in the physical sense but in the sense of everyone at the table being comfortable) has led to more people not being able to handle hard food. Obviously it is a tool and people can use it if they want. I am just noticing a tendency that seems to be arising, where people have had a harder time dealing with this kind of thing as these tools have gained traction in the community (I think maybe because we are priming people to be on alert for stuff). I just don't know that I feel it is particularly healthy. The gaming community doesn't seem to be a very good place lately.                         </div>

I don't know. I could see it doing both actually: on the one hand making people more sensitive to content, on the other giving people a sense that the presence of the cards means they don't have to be as mindful because the card will put the breaks on anything bad. But what I do think is tools like this, while well intentioned, are probably not that healthy for us. It just appears people are getting less resilient.                         </div>

<br/>I think that you should try and look at some hard data and then even if there is a correlation between safety tools traction and people having a harder time dealing with these things, find a way to show that there is causation. Maybe your initial instinct is right, I don't know I haven't looked at data either, but when I read this comment it seems like you are just reaching a conclusion you prefer with no real backing.<br/><br/>There are many possibilities:<br/>1. Safety tools are gaining traction because more people are comfortable/vocal talking about things they already had a hard time with (leading to a perception that people in general are having a harder time dealing with things)<br/>2. People are more comfortable/vocal talking about things they have a hard time with because safety tools are gaining traction<br/>3. Safety tools are gaining traction because more people are having a harder time dealing with things (due to some third factor or set of factors)<br/>4. People aren't having a harder time dealing with things, and also aren't more comfortable talking about things they have a hard time with. Due to safety tools gaining traction, you more often notice the people who were already there having a hard time with things<br/>5.  People are having a harder time dealing with things because safety tools are gaining traction<br/><br/>etc. etc. etc.<br/><br/>We clearly can't just pick 5 out of the bunch. Maybe you have more concrete experience with this than your comment implies though?<br/><br/>In any case, GM/RPG horror stories are, and have been for a long time, a genre in and of themselves. I think it's good to think of ways and analyse the effectiveness of ways we can try to establish a culture, or at least provide tools for the more high risk scenarios (eg. convention and game store play) to lessen the negative impact of these moments. I'm not particularly persuaded by "safety tools aren't a good idea" because that would mean that the best we can do (i.e. the way things used to be) is... not great. I also agree that current safety tools can be improved. <br/><br/>Maybe one way of combining your thought about focusing on safety tools and safety could be negative with trying to make things better is to implement a kind of "stealth" safety tool. Something that works as a safety tool, but people don't realise that's what it's doing and its not explicitly mentioned as such. I don't have the experience to know whether this would be worth attempting.<br/><br/> </div>

But if the tools are actually counter productive and make people less resilient, is it good to explore them? Again, I am just going by what I am seeing, what I've experienced in my own life, what I have read from psychologists on how to deal with this stuff (and how I've seen it play out in my own life and among people around me). But I just am increasingly convinced these tools, and building this sort of culture, is making people more prone to issues, not helping them.

I am saying I am not particularly interested in safety tools. I think they are harmful and misguided, and I think we are creating a worse gaming culture in the name of safety. The last thing I would want is a stealth tool. I think safety tools as a concept need re-evaluation. I think our pre-occupation with safety (and again not physical safety but safety in the sense of being protected from discomfort) needs to be re-evaluated.                         </div>

I do understand that. I think it is going to be difficult to do. I am no social scientist. But based on everything I've seen and read, it is what I think at this point. I will leave it to others to make arguments about it. I just think it is becoming very obvious this stuff doesn't work the way it is intended to. And I definitely find the present day gaming culture  not what I would regard as a healthy one. Subjective I know. But I think it is fair for people to give their opinions in this way. We can't all produce master thesis on these topics. But we can vote with our opinion.                         </div>

But why must I prove something, when you are not expecting proof in favor of the X card. That people are suffering doesn't make their subjective opinion more accurate than mine does it? And I am speaking from my own experiences with this stuff as well. I am not interested in prolonging peoples suffering. In fact I want people to suffer less. And I think giving people a tool that encourages avoiding things that make them uncomfortable will cause them to be less resilient in the face of discomfort, and more sensitive to triggers of discomfort. Also, it is probably less healthy for people who don't have these issues, because it seems to be producing a heightened sensitivity to things across the board (not just among people who have trauma). <br/><br/>I am just not at all persuaded these are healthy tools, or that we are moving in a healthy direction.                         </div>

                            In general, if people are discussing the finer points of safety tools, entering the discussion with "these tools are all harmful and bad" heavily disrupts that conversation and takes it to a lower level, creating little goodwill in the process. I do think that the general discussion about safety tools and their possible harmfulness is important to have, but it should be a different discussion, since it has completely different premises.<br/><br/>This thread had quieted down, so an ongoing discussion was not disrupted, but this general phenomenon is something I occasionally see. Just like people discussing the finer points of random encounter tables would not benefit from someone intruding with "D&amp;D is colonialist" or someone designing a game with lots of shared narration and how the token economy there works would not benefit from "I can't immerse in my character if I have all this narrative power".<br/>The secondary discussions are interesting, but having them in the same conversation as the other will drown out the original discussion, which is more specific and thus often more interesting.

                            I do think raising an unrelated issue would be highly disruptive. But this is more like someone asking if encounter tables are even a good or useful idea, or if they lead to bad gaming, in a discussion about encounter tables. I think as much as I am in favor of encounter tables, getting push back on the concept would be useful to me in a discussion (and has been in the past). Happy to drop the subject if this is considered a derailment. But to me it seems relevant to the OP                        </div>

<br/>I think it is totally reasonable for you to decide which groups you want to game with and to have this conversation. But this doesn't look like an argument in favor of safety tools (unless I am missing something). You are basically establishing boundaries before hand, unless you are saying you would also like the card. But what if a group told you, they didn't want to use the X Card? I realize you might not join, but do you think that is a fair position for people to have in a group? <br/><br/>But gaming is as much a part of the real world as anything else, and I think it is reasonable to ask if gaming spaces should dance around this stuff. Where I am coming from on this, and only bringing this up because it seems like it is a necessary part of the conversation, is I have a long history of mental illness in my family, and I've personally dealt with PTSD issues myself. Just my own experience here with this stuff is it generally hasn't been helpful or productive to people with these kinds of issues govern what is allowable in terms of conversation, what people are watching in a common area, etc. Rather than help the person in question, it almost seems to just spread more neurosis. Just in my own case with the PTSD, the worst things for me, were people stepping around issues that might have made me upset. Whether that was them avoiding watching things on television when I was there, not addressing things in conversation, or reacting by backing off something if I seemed to react. That approach was harmful to them, and it was harmful to me. And ultimate I got better when people didn't do that (and I did get better, because these things are surmountable). So my concern here is I just feel like the overall gaming culture has become more neurotic and less mentally healthy, the more (ironically) we talk about and prioritize these issues. Just my view. I don't expect everyone to share it. But I do think people should at least consider the possibility that the prevalent assumptions are wrong or even potentially harmful. Also I think giving positive attention to this stuff, can be a bit of a reward, that encourages people who don't really have problems, or have fairly minor ones, to exaggerate. <br/> </div>

Yes that's exactly part of what I'm suggesting. Either bring up the issues you don't want, or suggest you want an agreement to use safety tools. <br/><br/>I'm not buying your other argument. People should be able to choose in which settings they want to deal with their issues. If they don't want to do it in a gaming context, it's up to them. Full stop. <br/><br/> </div>

I do think it is up to them. And I think the best solution there is to not play with groups where that will be a problem or leave groups if it becomes one. I don't think the gaming community is well served by bending into this stuff because overall it seems to make everyone less resilient and less capable of managing. Not suggesting people should be cruel. But I think we've gone way too far in the direction of placating every possible concern that could arise. Just not seeing the results are good                        </div>

                            I wouldn't characterize the gaming community trying to be considerate of others as "bending" to it. Couldn't the community as a whole be doing it because they consider it good?                        </div>

With the context, what you're saying makes a lot more sense. I'd suggest you take a look at Ben Lehmann's writing about gaming with PTSD (summarized <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/games-disabilities-everyone-should-read-ben-lehman-talk-about-his-ptsd-gaming-and-the-x-card.815026/" rel="nofollow">here</a> - briefly, that the safety tools we're talking about here were worse than useless for him, but some other techniques (besides "just toughen up") *did* help. </p></div></blockquote>
The original google+ link doesn't work, so I had to go by the summary, but I believe I probably disagree with Ben Lehman. In terms of privilege, I don't think a person's race or other status means they can't weigh in and have real opinions here. Nor does someone having PTSD mean their opinion is automatically more accurate or should be held above someone who doesn't. This is maybe the second time ever I've mentioned having PTSD. I don't personally like getting into, but made a choice of mentioning it here and in another forum, precisely because people will dismiss you as privileged if you don't. Personally I consider it a private matter and don't consider an important part of who I am. But it feels like to engage in this conversation revealing that sort of detail is becoming necessary. I'd prefer it wasn't and I think our pre-occupation with things like privilege is part of what leads to that problem. <br/><br/>Again, if it didn't work for him, it didn't work for him. I think we need to focus on making people stronger rather than weaker. That doesn't mean you say 'just toughen up', but it does mean we try to toughen people up. I've seen the benefit of this in my life in so many areas. Whereas I've never really seen the benefit of the kind of approach the gaming community seems to embrace. I think we are ultimately harming ourselves and creating a highly dysfunctional community (and if you think otherwise I would just ask yourself to take a look at the community, at how people communicate online, at how this stuff so often becomes its own excuse for cruelty and then ask yourself if you are genuinely, truly happier in the gaming community now then you were ten years ago or when you started). Personally I am pretty much done with the online gaming community for this reason. I just don't find I connect with the culture of it anymore.                         </div>

I did read it (and realize there are many places where I agree with you). I wasn't saying people should be thrown in against their will. If someone has a serious enough issue like that, I am just saying, it is probably best for them to avoid games with that kind of content or leave games if that stuff starts coming up. Not saying we should be cruel. I just feel like we focusing so much on it, and making it such a priority, that it is actually having counter productive impact. Obviously you might not agree with my conclusions, and that is fine. But personal experience and observation has led me to a very different conclusion about this than what I see becoming the norm in the online gaming community. <br/><br/>And the problem with this stuff is it really could be anything. People get traumatized for all kinds of stuff. Right now we are focused on specific things, but people have trauma from car accidents, from being the victims of violent theft, from being bullied, etc. Is it really reasonable for us to worry about the presence of bandits in a game as a triggering thing, or the presence of car chases? I am not trying to be facetious. I am seriously saying we are getting less interesting material as a result of our hyper-focus on the possibility that a player at the table might have trauma. This is why I am saying the game table needs to be understood as being part of the real world where these things might come up. And if someone has an issue with one of these things, I think they need to find a group that is fine with working around that. But the growing expectation that every table work around it, is what I am reacting to. <br/><br/>For what it is worth I don't believe in the healing power of RPGs either. I do not thing RPG roleplaying and the kind of roleplaying you see in therapy are at all the same (and most of us, the vast majority I would say, are not equipped to help people in need of actual therapy at the gaming table).                         </div>

Half agree.<br/>I think that the way 95% of <i>safety tools</i> whatever-we-end-up-calling-them–tools are implemented have a counter productive impact. They do more harm than good and more harm than no safety tools. (That's why I'm <b>not</b> on board with all the "X-card is better than nothing" posts.)<br/><br/><b>But</b> I believe we can (I'm talking long perspective here, maybe 20 years down the road) design safety tools completely differently and ham them do more good than harm and more good than having no safety tools.<br/><br/>A horror movie… The editor, the script writer, the director all made choices for your benefit and then you can always turn off the VCR and eject the tape if you still can't handle it. A novel, you can put it back on the shelf or give it away if it's not to your liking.<br/>A movie stays in the TV and a novel stays on the page.<br/><br/>Role playing games have no such boundaries. They go straight into the brain. Except the boundaries we as a community set up. If you see my recos they're not particularly draconic. And it's meant to be very group specific.                        </div>

That's why people are looking for general solutions.<br/><br/>Some of those general solutions, including your suggestion (that the onus is on the person having the issue to find a group willing to work with them), have some issues that make them less appealing to me. I used to be very messed up before I had extensive therapy. I didn't want to talk about my trauma (and, as I said, wed be here all night. And, maybe get triggered yourself. I've… been through some shit) but I also wanted to play RPGs because I hated my real life so I really enjoyed the escape. I didn't see why everything would have to be so grimdark all the time.<br/><br/>Other proposed general solutions have other issues.                        </div>

                            But you can always get up and leave from an RPG just as you can put down a book or stop watching a movie. All these media produce imagery in our minds.

Okay but that is borderline illegal behavior, if people are physically not allowed to leave when they wish to (and not anything like how standard RPGs are conducted). At that point you are not playing in a RPG and doing something much closer to the behavior of a cult or kink community.                         </div>

                            I wonder if you might be operating from a simplified conception of triggering content and its consequences. We're getting an increased focus on safety tools because people to a larger degree discover &amp; care about previously marginalized groups (such as PTSD sufferers or racialized / exile existences) and content that, well, sucks disproportionately for them, such as trauma triggers or micro aggressions.<br/><br/>The "head in the sand it didn't happen" of X-card is harmful; we agree there. Bluntly including all kinds of shit because "people can't be shielded from upsetting content" is something else altogether.<br/><br/><b>Care about the other people at the table</b> is a pretty good principle.                        </div>

I don’t want people holding folks against their will. But that isn’t a safety tool issue. That is an issue people not breaking the law. I also don’t want people to punch me at a game. I don’t need a safety tool for that either. These are problems that go beyond the ability of rulebooks and game culture. At that point, you get the police.                        </div>

I think we have fundamental disagreements in worldview. I definitely would call myself liberal but not woke, and a lot of this seems to be a woke way of thinking to me.

<br/>Sure but holding people against their will Is illegal. The problem you described at the table goes well beyond the realm of safety tools and guidelines. If people are going to physically stop a player from leaving, I don’t think a safety tool is going to help.                        </div>

My intention is definitely not to make you feel this way, so I apologize if my tone is coming off as hostile or anything (I am just trying to be very clear and blunt because in many of these discussions I find people use careful language to cloud their position, and I want my position to be clear). But if it is any consolation I often find myself in the very same position of getting attacked from both sides in these discussions, so I can appreciate your feelings here. I think you are a very reasonable sounding person and we just disagree on a few things. But I don't think you are coming from a bad place or anything. <br/><br/>
<blockquote>That can happen with some of the strategies employed by the social justice community, yeah.

And this is probably where a lot of our disagreement lies. I share your interest in things being accessible, but I personally feel the focus on this so much has actually had the reverse effect. And just from my own life experience, I would rather equip people with a stronger mindset, rather than a victim mindset ( which I think has happened). Because it feels like we are actually going backwards, and I think a lot of it is because there is a self-fulfilling prophecy where people are reading into things too much.

This isn't childlike behavior. This is a normal human interaction where you are asking someone to do something different because you are having trouble seeing the dice. I have hearing loss and have almost no hearing in my left ear. I often have to ask people to repeat themselves. That sort of request is reasonable. I think when it becomes unreasonable is people making  big production about it, or trying to stir the community to collective action over it. It is the kind of thing I see on twitter all the time that I have in mind here, where people use this sort of thing to draw attention to themselves and promote themselves (or simply to complain). It is one thing for me to ask someone to repeat themselves. It is another thing for me to interpret their responses in the least charitable light and take to twitter to talk about my 'mistreatment'. That is the sort of ting I am seeing a rise in and a lot of it I think is just people seeking attention because we've given them this tool to do so.                         </div>

No, I am not saying people should just going around telling rape jokes. Most groups are pretty uncomfortable with rape jokes and rape in game, so I think that is one of those lines that has always kind of existed in the hobby (and certainly exists anytime you are in mixed company). There are jokes that might fly in the locker room that won't fly at a gaming table or at a cocktail party. I don't think the solution to that is community action. I think the solution is for someone to say something if they don't like what they are hearing and (very importantly) to move on after its done. I see uncomfortable subjects get raised in conversation sometimes, and someone points out they don't want to hear it, and folks move on. That is different though from worrying about hidden triggers in a game. I was in a conversation the other day with gamers where it was questioned whether violence should even be allowable in RPGs or whether systems should actively discourage violence not deemed morally justified. That is where a lot of this stuff starts to go off the rails for me. <br/><br/>But like anything else, I think this does come down to people feeling the room. Sometimes at a game you will hear off color humor, and I think that is okay if everyone is okay with it. But sometimes people misjudge. I don't think a simple misjudgment in that case needs to be deemed catastrophic. <br/><br/>Again, I think there is an issue here with us having a pre-occupation with trauma, and almost treating like something sacred.                         </div>

                            If you intend to make a game (story, convention or any kind of work) fly for a number of people you've never seen, you've got to think more cases than what your everyday view on ethics taught you.

                            So I guess we have four kinda incompatible positions around trauma represented.
<ol><li>Trauma is just what it is and we should try to deal with it by erasing triggers post-hoc (X-card)</li><li>Trauma isn’t sacred &amp; people should stay out of the hobby &amp; only play with their own safe group</li><li>Erasure &amp; rug-sweeping is invalidating &amp; game groups should be used for healing (P.H.

But I don't see a lot of psychological evidence for the current state of the art of the safety tools either. "Vague hunches" describe them pretty well too. Which is why I see this field as being in its nascency.                        </div>

I am pretty sure heterodox academy is a partisan organization.

But I think there is a middle ground here between telling people just to walk it off and infantilizing them (or worse treating them like sacred cows). On the one hand, I do think making people stronger should be the goal. The goal of healing should be becoming more reliant, and so I think on the whole our approach should encourage strength and resilience. But of course some people are not as strong as others, or have deeper issues that take more time healing. At the same time, we can't expect an entire hobby or culture to part around all of our individual needs and concerns in this way. Ultimately we have to learn how to navigate the real world, and the hobby is part of the real world. The hobby isn't therapy. And I think the emerging culture around trauma in the hobby is one where it is starting to become a retreat from the real world for people where I see a tremendous amount of dysfunctional behavior arising. I do want compassion. But what I am seeing alarms me a lot. I don't see people acting like adults at all. I see people behaving very childishly and I see a lot of bad behavior, even cruel behavior, arising in the name of helping people with trauma.                         </div>

Of caring, of having each other’s best interest at heart.<br/></p></div></blockquote>
I think it would be unfair of me to expect every group to be able to handle frequent issues surrounding my hearing. Especially as it gets worse (for example, if and when my hearing goes completely should I expect all game groups to master sign language?). I certainly would not want people to be jerks about it, but there is only so much I can expect from others in this type of situations. So I would much rather play with people comfortable dealing with my requests for people to repeat themselves than with people who are compelled by some community guideline to do so or who feel pressured to do so but deep down find the whole experience too frustrating. I have further limitations stemming from surgeries I had ten years ago and these are much more disruptive than my hearing loss. The problems arising from my surgeries simply can’t be accommodated by every group so I have to play with groups willing to allow me to host or play mainly online (pretty much all of my gaming is online at this point for this reason). Gamers on the whole don’t have the resources or expertise to deal with this sort of thing. Also, at the end of the day people giving me special treatment, or treating my perspective as more valid or sacred, is the last thing I want when dealing with people. I don’t like the current preoccupation with identity for this reason. I don’t see these very real limitations as defining features of who I am. And I think the move towards seeing this sort of thing as essential to one’s identity is weakening people. Again not saying people shouldn’t be accommodated. There are times and places when accommodation should occur (for example if I am at the doctors I expect them to accommodate me). Not saying the challenges here aren’t real either (it is a real effort for me to leave the house for more than an hour or two). But I have grown more when I have had to manage in environments that don’t always cater to my concerns. I know what is involved and it is more than most people can realistically do. It would be very unfair of me to expect game groups to upend their whole way of doing things just to make my time easier. And gamers are not physicians, psychologists or experts on this stuff. And I see a lot of people going around acting like they are because they have learned a few new words. Further I think gamers have a really hard time handling nuance and balance. So so much of the shift around this looks like a very chaotic mess, that is well intentioned but producing far more harm than good. And I think there are a lot of bad actors exploiting the current climate as well for self promotion and personal gain. Obviously I only speak for myself here. <br/><br/>Also I think being considerate is great. That is how people ought to be. But being considerate is an individual choice. It is very impractical and unrealistic to think we can make everyone in the hobby better people (or that it is our place to do so). This kind of social campaign can go off the rails very easily, and I think gamers are some of the least equipped people to launch moral/social campaigns. Most of what I have seen from these efforts in the hobby appears very negative to me<br/> </div>

                            I think there’s a conflation of four different things. (1) Tools that signify what kind of game this is, e.g. a light hearted action adventure where the heroes win vs HBO violence gloom (2) If we’re playing HBO violence gloom then what tools do we have to do so in a mindful way. (3) The issue of experiential avoidance in the culture at large and roleplay culture in particular. (4) the politicizing of content, the hobby in general.<br/><br/>On point three. Even in therapies like ‘acceptance and commitment therapy’ where avoidance is seen as the main dysfunction, this doesn’t mean you just throw potentially traumatic content around. The whole idea is that the person must see how avoidance is creating dysfunction.<br/><br/>In terms of point one, for conventions and so on, I’m in favour of a ratings system. Something like:<br/><br/>Friendly: No involuntary character death, no horrible stuff.<br/><br/>Dangerous: Involuntary character death, mild horrible stuff.<br/><br/>Adult: game may contain disturbing content but has safety tools at hand.<br/><br/>X-rated: All bets are off.<br/><br/>I think for cons this works best because it channels people with certain mind sets into the appropriate rating system. The edge-lords get to be all x-rated and don’t mingle with the people who care about others feelings. If I want light hearted heroics I can go for friendly AND the type of person who declares their game is friendly will be more likely to give me the experience I want than someone forced into it.                         </div>

I think that X-cards and accessibility concerns, signal consideration. That’s more important than any particular implementation. It’s also why they should always be opt in and never be mandatory.                        </div>

My issue with this is: this isn't actually dangerous. It is standard. It is how most RPGs since the beginning have been run, and it shouldn't require a warning label. If someone wants a G rated game, by all means, have G rated games. But do we really need to frame normal ways of playing as 'dangerous'?                        </div>

Sure, but at the same time these therapies understand that beyond the walls of the office, the real world remains the real world. And they certainly don't encourage people in therapy to use trauma as a weapon against people to control conversations or demand action. Look, I come from a family with a long history of mental illness. One of the lessons you learn from that is it is not a good idea to let people with mental health issues govern the terms of conversations. Doesn't mean you aren't empathetic or compassionate. But it does mean you don't allow their reality to become everyone's reality. And you do need to keep the ability to reality check them. What ends up happening in those circumstances is everyone starts behaving neurotically. What I am saying is we are giving so much primacy to things like trauma, that the community as a whole, at least to me, appears very, very dysfunctional. So much so, I don't really like participating in any of the online communities these days (especially on platforms like twitter). I just don't see people behaving the way I expect normal adults to behave. The overall tone has regressed to something more like elementary school. <br/> </div>

But the reason for this is these things are usually inseparable in most of the actual conversations occurring in the community. All this stuff has become pretty intertwined.                         </div>

I am entirely on board with the idea that "safety tools" may have issues and cause problems, and <i>even more</i> on board with the idea that we can do better and should try to keep learning and improving.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to the *positives* of safety tools, we have, at least, a lot of people saying, "hey, I love these! It allows me to feel more comfortable when playing with strangers", or other reports of positive game experiences. We have a lot of reports, anecdotes, and informal support. Lots of people are relating positive experiences, and explaining how it has helped their gaming. Furthermore, we can explain the reasoning behind many of these positive experiences: having these tools, even if you don't use them, serves to communicate a concern about people's safety, for a single example. I've heard people say that their experience as gamers at conventions has improved since the introduction of safety tools; stuff like that.<br/><br/>None of these are ironclad arguments or solid proof! I recognize that. But it's something.<br/><br/>That's we have to balance "a vague hunch" against. I really like that you (Sandra) are discussing these things in detail, and outlining specific problems and concerns. That's a great start! I hope more people will do the same, no matter what angle they're coming from - it's just nice to hear specifics and thought-out, considered responses rather than offhand dismissal.<br/><br/>I also found this really interesting:
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" rel="nofollow">Bedrockbrendan</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Look, I come from a family with a long history of mental illness. One of the lessons you learn from that is it is not a good idea to let people with mental health issues govern the terms of conversations. Doesn't mean you aren't empathetic or compassionate. But it does mean you don't allow their reality to become everyone's reality. And you do need to keep the ability to reality check them. What ends up happening in those circumstances is everyone starts behaving neurotically. What I am saying is we are giving so much primacy to things like trauma, that the community as a whole, at least to me, appears very, very dysfunctional. So much so, I don't really like participating in any of the online communities these days (especially on platforms like twitter). I just don't see people behaving the way I expect normal adults to behave. The overall tone has regressed to something more like elementary school. <br/></p></div></blockquote>
So, thank you both for adding some personal experiences to this discussion. It gives us all more to think about! The more perspectives the better, I think.                        </div>

I do want to be clear that I am not a fan of sharing this stuff. I have spoken about it occasionally, mostly in positive terms. But generally these are things I regard as very private However it is becoming increasingly hard to engage in these conversations without revealing details like this if you want people to take you seriously (for the reasons I pointed to in an earlier post). I don't think that is a good development. I think it is much better if peoples opinions are not given special weight because of background, experience or identity. Obviously someone with expertise can have insights we shouldn't dismiss. But someone with personal history in something can still be wrong, or inaccurate, or selfishly use that experience to win an argument.                         </div>

A lot of useful posts and resources disappeared when google+ went down. Some of them were archived though. It is possible someone put that article somewhere for preservation purposes.                         </div>

I would rather have safety tools work on a completely different level; like how a horror movie has the volume knob &amp; offswitch on your TV on a separate layer from the aesthetic choices made by the writer, director and editor. <strong>I have this sorted as a minor gripe because a coherent ruleset is not nearly as important as our safety.</strong>)</small><br/></div></blockquote>
This doesn't really capture the reality of the X-card in use.<br/><br/>1. I have never seen anyone ignore an X-card. If someone ignored an X-card when I was a participant, I would stop the game and eject them from the table/group/convention (whether I was GM or not). I have a hard time imagining a tool that is ignore-proof, anyway. Using safety tools is a social-contract-level thing.<br/><br/>2. Don't the X-card explanations make it clear that you don't have to explain anything if you don't want to? And that you <i>can</i> talk about it, if you do want to? It's a communication tool.<br/><br/>3. I've never seen anyone go crazy-wild on the grimdark because the X-card was out. I've seen people in discussion forums say that it freed them a bit to explore darker material, yes. That is, without a safety tool, people at the table intentionally held back much more than they needed to, but with a safety tool, they could push at the edges of the material a little more. Most likely, they discussed lines and veils and theme and everything else before then! X-card isn't meant to be the only safety tool you use at the table.<br/><br/>4. In most uses of the X-card, it gets used before the damage is done. Merely mentioning spiders isn't usually a trigger. It's the continual pushing of the imagery of spiders into the gaming situation that does the damage. That is, the X-card usually serves as a sufficient brake to avoid going deep into content that does harm. Someone mentions a spider and starts to narrate something, but the X-card is played and the narration stops.<br/><br/>I feel like your characterization of IWNAY mischaracterizes Meg's intentions, too.
<blockquote>It’s the idea that trying to avoid hurting each other is the equivalent of “abandoning” each other.<br/><br/>It pressures people into not being aware of their own boundaries.<br/></blockquote>
My interpretation of it (and I was there for discussions about it when it happened) was that a group of people who care about each other are going into a risky situation together, and whatever happens, they'll be there for each other. It's like RACK in the kink world, compared to SSC (caution / cw: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-aware_consensual_kink" rel="nofollow">wikipedia link for RACK</a> has a NSFW graphic whipping image on it).<br/><br/>I think IWNAY in no way encourages people not to be aware of their own boundaries nor does it equate avoiding hurting each other with abandonment. In fact, I don't think IWNAY is incompatible with lines and veils. You could play a game with no sexual violence, but everything else is on the table and, if something difficult or painful comes up, the people at the table won't abandon each other. It's just a promise of support when the hard stuff surfaces.<br/><br/>I think it's a contrast to a lot of gaming environments where hard stuff can come up at the table, but it's no one's responsibility to deal with it but yourself and there's no expectation of mutual support for it.                        </div>

RACK has the letter C. <b>Consent.</b><br/>In the examples in the thread for IWNAY, we have specific examples of people breaking lines.<br/> </div>

                            Also I don't think I was being that unfair to IWNAY. I said that I'm trying to do a Postel take on IWNAY. That is a difficult commitment and that has been difficult in practice because I've had some very sensitive players take on some very touchy stuff, some for me very hurtful stuff, and I've stuck with it because my commitment to P-IWNAY.                        </div>
