Instead of relying on Fortune (dice rolls) to resolve actions, use a Karma-based sanity system. Like, each player would have a pool of Sanity points (bag of marbles?) and if he* wants to do one of those cool little moments that CoC is known for, he just pays a price in X marbles. So, if there's a clue in the Necronomicon that the players have to find before the plot can move forward, they just find it... as long as somebody is willing to pay a point of Sanity first. If you want to unload your Glock into a beastie, it happens, no roll needed... but it'll cost you some Sanity if it doesn't take the thing down.<br/><br/>The point is, it replaces all of that rolling -- which is often pointless anyway, since the GM already has an outcome in mind -- with a basic currency of those moments that really make the game.<br/><br/>Perhaps one could combine this with the bid mechanic from <a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">Greg Stoltze's <i>...In Spaace!</i></a> to good effect.<br/><br/><br/>*We're talking Lovecraft, and I shall be chauvinist.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66588/#Comment_66588" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T11:59:19+00:00" title="May  2, 2007 11:59AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Larry,<br/><br/>That sounds like a lot of fun!

So, who's the "mystery author"? I was kinda assuming a pretty traditional GM here (backwards compatible with existing CoC scenarios!) but there's certainly the possibly of having new-fangled player-authored mysteries and such.<br/><br/>As for your second question, that's why I brought up the bid mechanic. It might be pretty dull if the GM has assigned a soak value of 30 to "Shambling Walker of Splugfrlorgoflop", checks it against a pre-determined killing power value of 8 for a full burst from a Glock, and says, "Oh, yeah, he sort of staggers a bit. Got anything bigger?" I suppose you could do all sorts of things. I guess there's sort of an assumption there that the thing that's really squicking you out is not that the thing looks gross, but the realization that you just dumped a massive amount of firepower into the thing and it barely scratches it. So... maybe as the power of your attempted attack increases, so too must an amount of Sanity you'll willing to wager. Say your pistol has a minimum bid of 1 and your shotgun has a minimum bid of 5 and that stick of dynamite has a minimum bid of 10. Because, if it survives each of these things, it has just demonstrated its true danger to you. Maybe you'd be better off running away before you learn more.<br/><br/>And there's an assumption here that successfully killing a critter is somehow non-threatening to one's Sanity. If you blast that ghoul into a lump of cold flesh, well, at least you know you can kill the bastards now. But you could certainly also make a statement about how even resorting to violence erodes one's Sanity, and have a cost for even attempting.<br/><br/>Oh, we can certainly trick out a bunch of nifty cases for a combat system, but I think we'd be better off talking about a unified mechanic that works equally well in combat as in researching Things Man Was Not Meant To Know as in exploring the lost city of Tchtchziknix'a. If you want to succeed, you have to wager Sanity. This also creates a player-controlled consequence for preserving Sanity. Instead of failing your SAN check and being stricken by (random roll) Tourette's Syndrome, you simply declare how you choose to protect your mind and lose the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66616/#Comment_66616" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T16:25:49+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  4:25PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2007 4:26PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty cool, Larry.

Adding choices like those would shift the focus away from the game fiction and more towards abstract strategy. I mean if you wanted to make it like Magic the Gathering where you have to prioritize which resource pool you want to use it would be great. Otherwise, I don't think multiplying the points of contact like that actually does anything to make the game more evocative. I'm not seeing what cool things would come out of making a choice between Unnatural and Helplessness, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66666/#Comment_66666" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T05:32:43+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  5:32AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Larry, that's <i>exploration of character</i>, that is.

I'm also behind you 100% on the unified mechanic end of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I'm still in the weeds is on the issue of <i>how do we determine if your bid is <u>enough</u></i>?  Because if it's pre-statted (ie: taking down a Deep One costs 5 San), then you're starting down a road that suddenly becomes a whole lot less appealing to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nDarcy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66709/#Comment_66709" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T09:40:42+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  9:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what Mark said.
