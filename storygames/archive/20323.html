Its "model" is the fronts but a lot of logic is placed in the "view"; fiction [i]directly[/i] triggers moves. This is like putting a bunch of "if X then Y" stuff directly in your button code. (Please don't take this as a complaint on AW, which I think is an amazing design.)<br/><br/>There are a couple of other "models" beside the fronts, such as the player's current resources (hold, hx, barter etc) and of course, the big one: [i]what has been established[/i] in the shared imagined space.<br/><br/>But a lot the mechanics concern the conversation in and of itself.<br/><br/>Contrasted with D&amp;D which has tons of models. The initative order, the action economy, the random encounter table, the turn structure (from older editions with the ten minute turn), the hex map, the prepared dungeons, the monster manual etc.<br/><br/><br/>This isn't meant to explain Vincent's own game to him... it's pretty clear that he "gets" this stuff. Maybe it's more of a way for me to explain it to myself.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447987/#Comment_447987" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-17T09:34:00+00:00" title="August 17, 2015  9:34AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2015 9:34AM by AsIf.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<pre>        MODEL<br/>      /      \\<br/>   VIEW   CONTROLLER<br/>      \\      /<br/>        USER<br/></pre>\nWhen I think of the MVC model outside of programming contexts, I try to remain at a very high level, regardless of game.  Typically (for a trad setup anyway) I see the Model as the GameWorld (part system, part GM, part session prep, part campaign notes or sourcebooks, part randomly determined and part improvised); the View is the Shared Imagined Space (which includes not only things the GM says but also things the genre assumes and portions of the gameworld for which Players are responsible), plus everybody's actions; the User is the Player(s) and the Controller is mostly the GM but also partly the Players (some functions - especially chargen - don't require GM intervention and instead directly access the Model, while some Player decisions are strictly color and directly affect the View without requiring a pass through the Controller-Model loop).<br/><br/>I find that you can draw lines for various individuals in dividing up that structure, but in drawing the diagram for a particular game you answer all the questions you had, and then the diagram is no more useful than the praxis itself.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447988/#Comment_447988" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-17T10:21:12+00:00" title="August 17, 2015 10:21AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2015 10:24AM by 2097.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In that case we use the analogy differently.<br/><br/>For me, the "view" is things like the playing board and minis, if such are used, and the conversation as per Apocalypse World, and the dice.<br/><br/>The view is the <i>description</i> of the SIS (and the interface with which you interact with the SIS), the model is the established <i>facts</i> of the SIS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447989/#Comment_447989" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-17T10:29:04+00:00" title="August 17, 2015 10:29AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            User -&gt;

Model (storing data) and View (showing said data) is basically the same thing. I can see why it's separated when it comes to programming, but it's not applicable on game design and processes. MVC seems, to me, like it's not designed to describe play; it's just describing the procedure for handling a single input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447993/#Comment_447993" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-17T11:06:13+00:00" title="August 17, 2015 11:06AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Sandra, I was sure we would interpret it in different ways.

I might go as far as to say that the logic one uses to divide those tasks and draw those divisions is the literal difference between one playstyle and another (or at least a very significant portion of it).

The view is the sheets and maps and the model is the rule book. At least that is how I would think of it. Controlling the game is through dice, conversations. The view is what the players experience, or the maps, figs, descriptions the GM reads. The model is the rules and data so those are the rule books, modules etc. character sheets I guess might be considered a model of a character since it is all the data about the character, but it is also a view since you can download a hundred different character sheets all for the same stats. <br/><br/>Rule books are also partially controllers since they contain the rules of how the dice are used and how actions are resolved. <br/><br/>But What is the equivalent for a RPG?<br/><br/>I would say: Theme, definitions(objects), rules and sheets(descriptions). That is a good starting point.<br/><br/>Theme is obviously the type of game and the feel that needs to flow through entire thing. Similar or description. <br/><br/>Definitions are how things are defined. So stats, AC, saving throws, points etc. how a character, monster, ship, planet or door is defined.<br/><br/>Rules are how objects(definitions) in the game interact...hmmm... Maybe objects instead of definitions. These are the actual turns, dice and difficulty charts that players work with. GM is also a player in this context. <br/><br/>Sheets are the views. yes a bad name, but deals with figs, maps, sheets, handouts and descriptions that are used to present the rest of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448293/#Comment_448293" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-31T15:58:08+00:00" title="August 31, 2015  3:58PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dice don't actually make decisions about anything. Dice just produce random numbers.<br/><br/>The controller in MVC is what decides what goes into the view, using the model as input, and storing state back into the model. Users interface only with the view.<br/><br/>So in an RPG, who are the users? The players (and GM). <br/><br/>What do the players actually interface with? The fiction (shared imagined space) of the game. I'd argue that they interface with dice and character sheets, too, but since the players are also the computing engine in this analogy, they act as the engine for the model, and dice and character sheets are model because they either produce calculations (a random number) or record state (the state of a character).<br/><br/>Other things in the model: the GM's notes or module, the game text, the configuration of people around the table, note cards on the table, beads or other markers on various things, and discussions happening around the table.<br/><br/>So players have discussions about what goes into the fiction by referencing their character sheets, the rules, various dice rolls, and other physical parts of the game. These discussions--via some agreed procedures (<a href="http://big-model.info/wiki/IIEE" rel="nofollow">IIEE</a>, if you care), and a kind of creative filter (each player's various agenda)--turn into accepted changes to the fiction (shared imagined space, or if you will allow me to change one of the terms, the "shared imagined <i>state</i>").<br/><br/>Though the fiction is a "state," don't mistake this for model. The user interface for a web application has state, too. What is showing on the screen at any given time? Has the user clicked the OK button yet? The fiction is the view, because its state is the primary interface <i>to the whole reason you play</i>, which is to <b>imagine a world together</b>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
