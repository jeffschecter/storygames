I volunteered to be the spotlight character as Adama, and we started on the Galactica bridge, with Colin's Starbuck explaining why Hot Dog had been killed on a routine scouting mission.  (We decided Adama's Issues--specifically, the ones out of his control--were Love and Loyalty, but didn't get much chance to address those in the short scene.)<br/><br/>The test scene definitely helped us get our feet wet with the phrases (mostly "more detail" and "do that differently"), but we agreed that giving <i>each</i> player a chance to spotlight in one of them, as the rules suggest, could have taken half the night.

A couple of them had played Archipelago II before but this was my first opportunity to play a "Norwegian style" game.  For some games you have a sense that it's going to be good for you just from reading the game, knowing your own preferences in play, and knowing your fellow players' general likings.  But you never know for sure until you get it to the table.  I really enjoyed it and I think everyone else did as well!  I'm thankful for everyone joining me on short notice as I'm facilitating it at GPNW next Sunday and wanted to do a dry run beforehand.  <br/><br/>Our cast: King Ragnar (Colin), The Earl of Gar\xf0ariki (David), Brand, the Knight (Brendan), Princess Valgerd (Jim), and the Sei\xf0kona Runa, (myself).<br/><br/>The rules are brief and I'd read them three times but as no one else had seen the game prior, I read from the book quite a bit to explain how the game is played.  I knew this probably wasn't the best method but I wanted to explain the game exhaustively; even though the procedures are simple, there are some details that seem especially important to emphasize.  A couple of the play modes were outside my experience, especially the role of the game's Theme Guide and their authority over a player's character's Themes.<br/><br/>Sitting to the right of Colin (King Ragnar), I had authority over the King's Themes of Ancestors and Law.  At one point the King blustered to the Gar\xf0ariki messenger Mord that his three generals, the brothers Harald, Hro\xf0gar, and Hogni would be sufficient to match the Eastern armies gathering at his borders.  Mord (David) presented the King with the head of Hogni (killed earlier on the orders of the Earl).  The King staggers at the audacity and impossibility of what he is seeing.  At this point, I offer that the ancestral Laws require the King to thank his guest (the messenger) for the gift, even one as horrific as this.  As Guides all of the players have the option to use the phrase, "<i>Do it differently</i>," if they think my offer is inappropriate to the story, but no one does and my narration stands.  In this case, I was creating a fact about the world and the King's lawful obligations to that fact, but the Theme Guide can even narrate the spotlight characters' actions, making the Princess rebellious, the Earl treacherous, and so on.<br/><br/>I liked this feature of the game.  Each of the players was themselves acting towards their character's Themes, but having that Theme Guide was like having a daemon on your right shoulder to drive actions or create world facts that you yourself may not have thought of.  <br/><br/>The whole game has well-wrought creative constraints that seem to help its players towards making an engaging story together.  The Theme Guides, the Phrases, the Location cards each with their own possible Events (directed by the Event Guide), along with the three questions on each of the character's sheets.<br/><br/>We ended up using the "<i>Do it Differently</i>" phrase quite a bit, which I was happy to see.  I think it probably always accomplished a better result, and with no hard feelings among the players.  David and Colin and I have a good comfort level with each other with suggesting alternative narration from playing PTA together; I wonder how well it works among players who've not played together before.<br/><br/>I think we only used the "<i>That might not be quite so easy</i>" phrase four times during the course of the whole game; we were providing each other with enough twists and uncertainty without needing to use it much.  I think I tried most often to draw it out from others by asserting my Sei\xf0kona as having accomplished several difficult things.  I think the Resolution cards are fun.<br/><br/>I didn't use the phrase "<i>More Details</i>" much (ever?) because people were providing quite a bit of detail on their own and I was concerned about the time.  Jason tells me he's never gone over two-and-a-half hours playing LitToS, but it took us about four-and-a-quarter hours to get through it all, including the rules explanation and a warm-up exercise to practice the phrases that was much more abbreviated than what is recommended in the text for your first time playing (we warmed up with one scene using BSG's Starbuck, Cmdr. Adama and Col. Tigh).  I definitely got some ideas on how I can abbreviate some of these things for next time so that we can get to playing more quickly.  I think I'd also take a stronger facilitator role in the future in directing the scenes to keep them shorter than they were.  The game text indicates only that the spotlight player decides when the scene is over and provides a phrase for the other players to <i>extend</i> the scene but not to wrap it up.<br/><br/>All the players really got into a Shakespearean vibe and our story ended up like an even more tragic King Lear with death, madness and regret all around.  Lots of wonderful re-incorporation of events and omens too.  Thanks everyone for playing!  I'm looking forward to revisting this game often starting next Sunday.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear from the other players what they enjoyed about the game, especially scenes from the fiction itself.  A lot happened!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276045/#Comment_276045" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-14T23:09:36+00:00" title="June 14, 2010 11:09PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthew!

I love the severed head, and using your Theme responsibility to make that even more horrible. That's genius, and exactly what the game can deliver when you are on the ball - using your authority to immediately recontextualize and heighten someone's creative contribution.<br/><br/>The application of phrases is very, very group specific. I find that my group uses "<i>That might not be quite so easy</i>" all the time to aggressively frame scenes, since it immediately prompts resolution and imparts forward momentum. If you are concerned with condensing the game into 2.5 hours at GPNW, definitely encourage going to resolution more often.</blockquote>(above quote from a duplicate thread we consolidated to this one)<br/><br/>I like the <i>"That might not be so easy"</i> phrase.  We may not have used it much due to unfamiliarity with the game, and maybe also because we were so comfortable using <i>"Do it differently."  </i>I think we expanded the phrase a bit beyond its original intent, using it not just when something seemed jarring or out of character but also as "How about something more along these lines, might that not be better?"  There were a few times where a character took an action that was relatively difficult but was so cool I didn't want to take the risk that it didn't happen by calling for resolution.  Maybe others were feeling something similar.<br/><br/>I do intend to use it the resolution card phrase more next weekend, but I'm not certain it will necessarily prompt a scene's conclusion.  That's been your experience?  Someone has the character take an action and I can just let it go by saying nothing so that they can get on to the rest of their narration, or I can use the phrase and we can take the time to deal with the resolution mechanic and interpretation\u2026  You see what I'm saying?  I saw scenes going a bit long here and there due to extended narration of colorful details or dialogue that wasn't necessarily moving the plot forward, not because a character was attempting something uncertain and we were unsure as to the result of that action and hadn't thought to invoke the <i>"That might not be so easy"</i> phrase.<br/><br/>Maybe some of the length was simply due to our liberal use of <i>"Do it Differently"</i> and then hashing out what really happened...<br/><br/>There were some other instances where people made some unexpected and interesting moves as Guides that are worth mentioning, but I want to give the other players the opportunity to relay them if they have time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276104/#Comment_276104" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T09:00:37+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  9:00AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 9:01AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience "<i>that might not be so easy</i>" is, among other things, a definitive flag that the scene needs to be resolved.

You think so? OK, Mike, will you resolve this for us?<br/><br/>MIKE (drawing a card): Hmm, "Yes, but", OK, the Princess agrees to murder her father, but makes you promise to kill the Sei\xf5kona at the same time, so the two of you can be together without any interference."<br/><br/>ME: But I love the Sei\xf5kona! <br/><br/>MIKE: Tough shit!<br/><br/>ME: Cold, so cold.

I can see that.<br/><br/>Two things about your example, Jason.<br/><br/>1)  I note that Mike as the resolution card interpreter and as a Guide (and not necessarily even with the additional authority that the Theme Guide has over a character's Themes), takes over authorship of both of the characters in the scene ascribing intent and action to them.  I hadn't picked up on this mode of play from the game text.  I'd anticipate a possible "Whoa! Do it Differently" from one of those two players in our Sunday game.  Actually, I don't think we ever pressed as hard as you do in the intial sentence of this example as far as narrating the other player's character's responses to our own actions.  Lots of active "face-stabbing" and bold maneuvers, but no, "and then you, Princess, totally do this."  That's an expected mode of play as well?<br/><br/>2) In our Sunday group I'd anticipate a "More Details!" after the resolution in the example, "What's that look like?  What do you say to each other?  Let's zoom in on that!"  Where do see most groups falling in terms of a "story-telling" versus "role-playing in-character dialogue," ratio for LitToS.  A wide range by group?  Is there some specific textual guidance there?  For myself, LitToS is a punchy white-hot Norse Reservoir Dogs blood opera for a completely awesome one-shot and it totally delivered on that level.  But at the same time it's an Archipelago II implementation.  It has mechanics and play-aids to help quickly focus and guide a group towards a rewarding game, but it also has those "More Details" and "Stay With It" phrases that might encourage the detailed world-building and pace of its parent game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276120/#Comment_276120" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T10:05:44+00:00" title="June 15, 2010 10:05AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuck, if you run this Sunday, I would love to be in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276121/#Comment_276121" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T10:07:54+00:00" title="June 15, 2010 10:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 10:09AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't take that example too literally, Matthew - there'd be roleplaying and scene painting in there as well.

Thinking back, we don't do that all the time, just when it seems appropriate. One thing I really like about Archipelago is that it is so malleable to local expectations and mores. It's just a ghost of structure, really, and you have to make it your own.<br/><br/>I'd love to see what your group, fresh off LitToS, would do with the broader, more mellow canvas of Archipelago.

Treachery, Ancestors and The Gods seemed to be most woven into our story.<br/><br/>The Earl and The Sei\xf0kona had angry sex in the cave by the waterfall.  There were two pregnancies.  I first gifted the Princess with a pre-marital pregnancy and Jim got me back later, gifting Runa with the Earl's seed after it became clear she loved the King and the King was suspicious of her.  <br/><br/>As far as magic we had implied magical animals, augury, fulfilled prophecies, divine and ghostly visitations as well as divine wrath.  In the first scene Runa bade Valgerd to try her weird to call the Elk to her and receive his wisdom.  I offered that she should concentrate more carefully that we would not see a repeat of her last attempt.  She summoned a different beast as she reached out with her capricious gift and her mind drifted to her love, the Knight.<br/><br/>Most of the relationships were toxic.  I think the relationship that carried the most weight for me was that of King Ragnar and his ghost queen Kadlin, played first by Brendan and then later by me here and there with my Ancestors Theme "lay-on" responsibilities.<br/><br/>The Knight wolf'ed out in the first scene.  Jim had unconsciously framed the opening scene in the swamp between the Princess and Sei\xf0kona as being under a full moon so of course the Knight needed to arrive and get wolfy.  (Brendan commented during character selection that he thought all of the characters were hot, but that he particularly liked the off-handed last sentence of the Knight's character synopsis, "He is also a werewolf.")<br/><br/>We glossed over the war; there was a battle scene towards the end as the Earl invaded the King's Hall.<br/><br/>As the Sei\xf0kona, I leaned towards the King as being the one I loved because it became clear early on that she was being wrongly implicated in assassination attempts against him (actually tasked by the Earl to the Knight).  This decision was cemented later by the Earl.  The Earl Yngvar found a dagger belonging to the king in what was ostensibly the Sei\xf0kona's tryst cave where she met only him.  Symbolically, he left a dagger emblazoned with his own house's mark in the king's scabbard and left it for the king to find.<br/><br/>The Sei\xf0kona was resolved shortly after the king found the Earl's dagger in "their" lover's bower.  She confessed her infidelity but swore truthfully her love and begged for mercy.  But the wrath of the Bear was upon him and he slew her with the Earl's dagger.  Her dying utterance another wretched confession: she loved him so fiercely that it was she who'd ended his queen to have him to herself.  The Earl was stuck down by a falling timbre in the King's hall, divine wrath wrought by the King's faithfulness to the Law.  The King fell in battle.  The Knight married the Princess and rose to the throne but was slain by her, as prophisized, in her attempts to unlock the powers of her Gift.  The Princess became the mad Witch-Queen of the Barrows.  In her epilogue she puzzled at why her killing her love did not unlock her Gift to an extent she was satisfied with and decides that their baby must be her greatest love...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276298/#Comment_276298" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T04:20:41+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  4:20AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I cannot throw enough goats at that.
