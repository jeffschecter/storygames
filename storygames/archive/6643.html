Is 4E just campaign rules for DDM?

This player is the "GM."<br/>3) Evenly divide the pieces on the opposing side between the remaining players. This is the "party."<br/><br/>You have now recreated the origins of DnD.<br/><br/>4) Have the GM re-drafts the pieces they control (their "team") from the ugly ("evil") races, and the party re-drafts their team from the pretty ("good") races.<br/>5) Play a sequence of battles; the GM re-drafts a new team between each battle (or not) and tries to have some vague fiction or logic connecting them (but don't sweat it). The party members keep their existing pieces. <br/>6) Occasionally allow party members to upgrade their pieces to better, but similar, pieces. For example, allow a 15-point offensive ranged unit to become a 20-point offensive ranged unit.<br/><br/>You now have a campaign between good and evil with character advancement.<br/><br/>7) Reduce the number of pieces that each party member controls to 1.<br/>8) Play Magical Tea Party between the battles with whichever pieces happen to be on the board. <br/><br/>You now have roleplaying, with about as much rules support as 4e contains.<br/><br/>9) Hack together a quick system to adjudicate those non-combat actions that you don't feel like handling with freeform roleplay. <br/><br/>And that's the straight-line path between a pure wargame like DDM and 4E.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147357/#Comment_147357" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T14:44:48+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  2:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Play Magical Tea Party between the battles with whichever pieces happen to be on the board. </blockquote>\nThis may be the best description of RPGs ever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147380/#Comment_147380" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T15:38:50+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  3:38PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played DDM and likely won't unless there's a paid position available which is bike-commutable,<br/>but i can say for sure that d&amp;d 4e is FUN; in fact really, really FUN -<br/>this marks it as a considerable improvement over d&amp;d 3e and 3.5e, both of which lacked this (apparently niche) quality.<br/><br/>Instead of ah-my-turn-is-over-now-i-can-go-to-the-restroom-or-make-a-sandwich,<br/>instead of how-can-i-fuck-over-these-other-poor-bastards-because-there-are-too-many-of-us-to-each-have-sufficient-screentime-<br/>so-i-must-thin-their-ranks-and-grandstand-to-catch-the-DM's-eye,<br/>instead of EVER staring grimly at the character sheet:<br/>NOW WE CAN FUCKING HELP EACH OTHER.
