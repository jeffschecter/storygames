So you don't have to DRAW the pictures, you just need to produce some pictures.

The video didn't make you feel anything, as in reach physically into your brain and make you feel certain things. It showed you certain stuff and you <i>decided</i> to care about that. So a game about it would offer the choice to care - it wouldn't <i>make</i> it have that feel.\n<blockquote>The main problem I see is that most of those games could handle what seems to be going on in the animation, but in fact, it's all a sequence of weird images and that's all. No dialogue, no story as such, just a weird atmosphere and a rich pool of images waiting for interpretation.</blockquote>\nI'm surprised how completely you've erased the authors intent. As if all the images dragged themselves together somehow.<br/><br/>At the same time I don't think you'd be interested at all if the author had no intent with this animation.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if tabletop play would need to be the same.

Some mechanical payoff, I think. I don't think everyone being happy is a payoff, since no one will associate their happyness with the GM's intent (as their all ignoring the intents existance). A martyr design where the game only works because of the GM intent but no one appreciates or even recognises the existance of that intent - I think that's designing a very rough game.
