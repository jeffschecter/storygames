Using that 'thing' should palpably impact the course of the game like, say, using 'swordsmanship' as a 'thing' could impact the game if swords are drawn.<br/><br/>Can anyone suggest a game that uses such a mechanic? I've come across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)#Characters" rel="nofollow">Traveller</a>, and some mention of <a href="https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/16/16241.phtml" rel="nofollow">Victoriana </a>. But I haven't been able to get a sense of what use is made of that concept in those games.<br/><br/>Is it as simple as affecting social interactions? What about also relying upon it to generate resources such as money and retainers or contacts? Surely there's a game out there that uses the element of social standing as a thing that can effect the course of play...

Superhero game - three ratings - Public Status, Detective Points, Personal Status. Each rated on 5 areas at the end of each game. Eg. If you cracked jokes you got a high "expression" score which helped your public status total.<br/><br/>It works really well. Iron Man 3, for example, is all about Tony Stark taking a kicking in his Personal Status score.<br/><br/>You'd need to rummage about on eBay for a copy though.<br/><br/>I refined it in "Squadron UK" converting it from "ratings" to "derived characteristics". Charisma, Perception, Luck. Behave like a hero, your Charisma goes up. Look for clues, your perception goes up etc.<br/><br/>The basic rules PDF which contains the full system you want is only $2 on RPGNOW<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/107240/Squadron-UK-Basic?term=Squadron+uk&amp;test_epoch=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpgnow.com/product/107240/Squadron-UK-Basic?term=Squadron+uk&amp;test_epoch=0</a><br/><br/>(I've just noticed I'm only charging $4 for the printed book! I've got to put that price up.)<br/><br/>In my "Code" books (The Comics Code, The Code of the Spacelanes, The Code of Steam and Steel) pubic perception and personal morality are simply non-physical hit points. On minus "Status" you're a wanted criminal. On minus "morality" you're an actual criminal - the GM takes your sheet and the character becomes an NPC villain.) They're on RPGNOW as well but they're not as close a fit to what you want as the GH/SqUK systems so I won't include links.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455911/#Comment_455911" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T09:08:05+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  9:08AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, let's start from the top: What's your game about?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_455914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455914/#Comment_455914" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T10:58:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2016 10:58AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Working on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455915/#Comment_455915" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T14:09:00+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  2:09PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2016 2:09PM by Rickard.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have a blank sheet with twenty rows.

The main (alien) culture is nostalgic, honouring custom and tradition. Adventures deal with battle, privation, captivity and escape, but also moral debate and courtship. It is anti-modernity, in the sense of being a counter to the regulated, commercial, bureaucratic culture of modern Earth.<br/><br/>In this alien culture, honour, renown, black-and-white morality are qualities to be striven for and cultivated. And if you have 'em, then you ought to be able to use 'em in the game mechanically to effect things. "I am honourable and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility#History" rel="nofollow">noble</a>!" would ideally be something that could improve your character's odds at achieving success in contests.<br/><br/>The solution I have so far is a simple point system, along the lines of for acts of nobility, honour, or renown, your PC gets points, which he can then spend to increase his dice pool, reduce damage, improve a roll, etc. Maybe that's enough? Not sure. Which is why I was hoping to look at other systems that use that theme as a mechanic...<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage" title="CreativeMage"><img alt="CreativeMage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/212/nJRPAL1YGL0U7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage">CreativeMage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455929/#Comment_455929" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T17:38:42+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  5:38PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Our game GOLDEN HEROES (1984) was lauded for its "campaign ratings' system which seems to do what you want. </blockquote>\nGreat!

You can then use that to infer things about the setting (e.g. if the pirates have heard of your fight against the dragon, then probably the Navy does, too - also, perhaps that means refugees from the dragon-infested region are traveling across the Sea on a regular basis).<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage" title="CreativeMage"><img alt="CreativeMage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/212/nJRPAL1YGL0U7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage">CreativeMage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455991/#Comment_455991" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-02T22:14:58+00:00" title="September  2, 2016 10:14PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I guess having high Nobility (noble deed points, right?) means NPCs who adhere to the world's code of honour* would be more agreeable? <br/><br/>So does this mean that NPCs who reject the code would be less?

And those who reject it would be less influenced by your Renown - though on this planet (which has a pulpy world-wide mono-culture) all but the baddest of bad guys respect the code, so perhaps you'd just get a penalty in using your Renown to influence that lot.<br/><br/>You could use your Renown to keep up respectful relations with pirates and assassins who respect the code (even if it's just the bits that they choose to respect). The idea would be that they know you for a Man of Honour, which equals a force to be reckoned with. Conversely, a man of no honour would be largely ignored by pirates (even if he were a doughty fighter). They'd be less likely to give in to the latter, as it would still besmirch their own honour to give in to a dishonourable man. But it would be excusable to yield to a Man of Honour who was your sworn enemy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage" title="CreativeMage"><img alt="CreativeMage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/212/nJRPAL1YGL0U7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CreativeMage">CreativeMage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455992/#Comment_455992" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-02T22:20:21+00:00" title="September  2, 2016 10:20PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>*What-ho!

Do they all know each other?  Are they all very well informed about far-away events that don't impact them personally?  Are they even very well informed about some small act of heroism a mile down the road?<br/><br/>Does a Noble deed have to be witnessed by traveling bards and messengers, or influential people who employ them, to count as Noble?  Or does risking your life to pull someone out of a quicksand pit, with no witnesses around, still qualify?<br/><br/>If you want to purpose-build a setting and a scenario m.o. where everything anyone ever does is witnessed and recorded and disseminated, or if you want to work "newsworthy" into the definition of "noble", then you probably need worry no further, and the Noble Deed Equals Renown system will make in-fiction sense just fine.  That actually sounds pretty interesting to me; I'd play that!<br/><br/>If you're <i>not</i> building your world and scenarios and "noble deeds" definitions that way, though, I (as a player) might have some trouble making fictional sense of earning universal acclaim from private moments of virtue.  If Renown is a big deal in this culture, then I'd want to explore that, including all the nuances of how Renown is born and grows and changes.<br/><br/>I don't have a ready-made mechanic for that, but I do have a lot of ideas based on how I GM my own game.

The first time they do something noteworthy, someone will ask, "Who are you?"  They'll then try to come up with a catchy answer, something memorable, like a superhero team name, or a reference to where they come from, or their mission, or just something alliterative.<br/><br/>Their main vocation is saving villages from trouble, and the first few times they do that, they get three types of recognition:<br/>- gratitude of villagers<br/>- gratitude and/or respect of landowner who controls village<br/>- respect of imperial govt. who told the characters there was trouble in the first place<br/><br/>As the characters do this a few times, they start finding ways to milk this for further renown.  They start looking for:<br/>- bards, storytellers, and other travelers to spread word of their deeds<br/>- villagers who are particularly taken with them, so they can deepen that connection, either by being friendly, or by showing off<br/>- recommendations or introductions to other landowners<br/>- authentication or vouching for their deeds by authorities<br/>- landmarks to erect, commemorating their deeds<br/>- disciples<br/>- audiences for their own storytelling<br/>- anyone influential they've particularly helped<br/>- romantic opportunities<br/><br/>Eventually, they wind up with a lot of potential forms of renown to take into each new scenario.  They may have:<br/>- letters signed by govt. officials<br/>- cool artifacts acquired during their adventures<br/>- practiced stories<br/>- a catchy name that's been circulated a bit and attached to stories by bards and the like<br/>- a temporary companion witness<br/><br/>This tends to get any new people on board pretty quickly with the basic idea that the characters are capable and trustworthy and good news.  Once you're introducing yourselves as "The Shadow Hunters, purifiers of Harkethal, slayers of Minecoil, wardens of Hesengard Keep" you tend to get a pretty good reaction, especially because the last of those is actually famous.<br/><br/>When I think through a new NPC or group's reaction to the player characters, this is the kind of stuff I consider in their favor.  <br/><br/>Against them, I consider:<br/>- distance from where they did their deeds and made their name<br/>- remoteness from hubs of travel and circulation of tales<br/>- remoteness from the domains of vouching authorities<br/>- proximity to competitors -- maybe this locale has its own famed heroes!<br/>- customs, beliefs, or superstitions which clash with the characters' way of doing things<br/>- regional enmities -- maybe this baron <i>hates</i> the baron whose land you just saved!<br/>- corruption -- these NPCs might be evil and thus hate do-gooders!<br/>- xenophobia, terror, or anything that casts the characters or their deeds in a threatening light (they <i>are</i> pretty dangerous)<br/><br/>That looks like a lot of factors, but it's really just "levels of remove" and a bunch of special cases.<br/><br/>Anyway, If I were going to systematize this, I think I'd probably log deeds, and then next to each deed I'd put a rating for how well-shared it is, updating that rating after each time the players do something to share it (possibly after a die roll to see if it worked).  <br/><br/>Then, when the characters traveled to new places and met new NPCs, I'd make a roll for their threshold of awareness, using their distance (geographical, cultural, informational) as a penalty.  A result of "5" means these people have only heard of the characters' deeds with ratings of 5 or higher.<br/><br/>In <i>Delve</i>, noteworthy deeds are things like saving a village over the course of an entire session, not one character's momentary act of heroism.  If I were charting momentary acts of heroism, I'd probably replace deeds with epithets, and have each Noble act feed into one of a handful of epithets.  So instead of a full group with "purifiers of Harkethal 4; slayers of Minecoil 3; wardens of Hesengard Keep 6" you'd have an individual character with "loyal 2, selfless 4, brave 6, graceful 3" or something.<br/><br/>If this basic way of looking at things seems useful to you, I'm happy to brainstorm other mechanical implementations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456014/#Comment_456014" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T02:04:04+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  2:04AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2016 2:04AM by Stephen P.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's fantastic, David!

I suggested Circles because they do a good job of modeling status and social connection -- it allows for mobility/advancement but also stresses status' relatively non-transactional nature. <br/><br/>The system you've described so far is completely transactional -- it's like a weird capitalist fantasy of social standing and class, where you earn social money and use it to buy social effects on a one-to-one basis. I feel like that approach is probably going to encourage your players to treat the system itself as a transaction, much in the way you discuss alignment systems being treated in other games.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456020/#Comment_456020" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T13:18:15+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  1:18PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Once you're introducing yourselves as "The Shadow Hunters, purifiers of Harkethal, slayers of Minecoil, wardens of Hesengard Keep" you tend to get a pretty good reaction, especially because the last of those is actually famous.<br/></blockquote>\nI can see a simple system of having "names" (or titles, I suppose) for your character and for the party generally - everyone being out to, literally, make a name for themselves. <br/><br/>As a D&amp;D bolt-on, I'd have it replace the XP system entirely, names being dished out in the same way as lesser and greater magic items. <br/><br/>Six ranks, natch:<br/><br/>1.

One could be a powerful ruler; another could be a newspaper or book publisher; a third could be a mob which gathers on Sundays under a monument.<br/><br/>Each "source" has an influence over an area (and this could be tracked relative to other sources, if necessary - the King controls such-and-such an area, but doesn't care what the mob thinks... yet devotedly reads the Northern Wizards' Monthly).<br/><br/>To achieve notoriety, you do not have to *do* things; you must convince a certain source of your qualities/virtues. To do THAT you *may*, of course, have to accomplish things (how else would you win their favour?), but that's not where this all hinges. It's, rather, about how much you have impressed a certain source.<br/><br/>Those sources then are assumed to distribute their opinion of you to the "population" they can reach. (Perhaps you could randomize just how much, if that seems too deterministic - e.g. while traveling through the King's lands, any subject of the King has a 1 in 4 chance of knowing the King's opinion of you, or 1 in 6 if it's a distant province.)<br/><br/>You create your reputation, then, by influencing various sources. (And, in the more involved version, the sources also influence each other - maybe someone who hates the King naturally hates anyone the King likes, for example.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456043/#Comment_456043" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T22:38:15+00:00" title="September  4, 2016 10:38PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fun, Paul!

This can go from +3 to -3, i.e.  Neutral, Ally (helping you even at a disadvantage), Helpful (help you if it won't hurt them) and also Hostile etc. on the negative end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
