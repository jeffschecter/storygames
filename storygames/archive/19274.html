One wants to have the school get rid of the Vice Principal. The New Kid in town wants to be the acknowledged King of the Road! And the tough gangbanger? He wants to learn how to knit a sweater for his mother.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu: Masks of Nyarlathotep: One of the characters is a Russian woman who used to be a countess, currently pregnant with the child of an Outer God. She's very ambivalent about this, but still hopeful, as she's been promised by cultists that her child will become the Tsar of all of Russia. Traveling with the group is an NPC Russian man, who used to be a count and has been her friend since childhood. He knows the situation, as does one other member of the group.<br/><br/>The rest of the group... well, everyone now knows she's pregnant. And, in the midst of fighting cultists and monsters, trying to figure out what's really going on and save the world, Father O'Connor has now decided that the really important thing is that the Count and Countess must get married. Obviously, the Count's the father. No one has denied this. And a wedding is just what everyone needs! They're in the a Russian neighborhood in Shanghai, in the French Concession (assuming a) I'm reading a map correctly and b) my source of information on Shanghai in the 1920s is correct), and this will make everyone's day! The good father would be happy to perform the ceremony.<br/><br/>The Countess hesitantly explained that she wants a Russian Orthodox priest, not an Irish-American Jesuit priest, to perform the wedding. This dismays Father O'Connor not a whit! He understands completely -- obviously, they had intended to marry all along. But, they needed a priest of their own sect to perform the wedding, and until they got to Shanghai, this simply wasn't possible. Well, now it is, and he will arrange all the details!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429990/#Comment_429990" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-25T21:36:55+00:00" title="March 25, 2014  9:36PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>They're in the a Russian neighborhood in Shanghai, in the French Concession (assuming a) I'm reading a map correctly and b) my source of information on Shanghai in the 1920s is correct)</blockquote>\nThis is indeed correct. <br/>MoN is set in 1921ish, isn't it?
