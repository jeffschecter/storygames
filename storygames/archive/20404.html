Not very good games, nor are they very popular, but I write them nevertheless.<br/><br/>     I wrote both the first and second editions of the Fantasy Heartbreaker rpg. It's an D20 OSR kinda game and nothing ground breaking. My other games are all thankfully lost in the mists of time, all be one. <br/><br/>     My new game is called Domicile. I call it a Narrative roleplaying game, but I'm not sure it is. I am fairly certin it is a rules-lite game. It was written and playtested totally in house (meaning that I wrote it and conned my friends and family into playing it) and as such lacks a lot of outside influences. <br/><br/>     Well the die is cast and it's out there for all the world to see and laugh at. But now that for all intents and purposes all the work on it is done I find myself reflecting on it's creation and on why I made some of the design decisions I made. I know only I can answer why I made them, but I was hoping that if I could bounce a few ideas off of you guys and see what you thought it might help me clarify some of my internal thoughts on these subjects as well as help point out the pitfalls in my thinking so as to avoid them in and future project if I were to take up the rpg design gauntlet again.<br/><br/>     My first question I would like to present to this most august body is this: What do you think of a game design philosophy of taking the play experience of a number of games you like. Internalizing what you think are their strong suits and best points of play. Then retaining only those parts that you as a GM are willing to actually use in play?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449133/#Comment_449133" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T02:56:42+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  2:56AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.  High marks for committing to negativity there.  I kinda wanna try to match it.  Let's see:<br/><br/>Although everyone in the world tries to retain the favorite parts of prior play when planning future play, it's not a totally doomed and horrible endeavor.  It's absolutely possible that in between the derivative drivel you'll inevitably employ, a new focus or emphasis for one of your chosen strong points will emerge and not completely suck.<br/><br/>Tailoring for your own GM preferences, while a navel-gazing ride down an echo chamber, is probably the best you can do, because any rule or procedure you have to <i>force</i> yourself to use is probably even more insipid than the others.<br/><br/>Of course, I can't possibly give you the brutal deconstruction your failed previous project so wretchedly deserves if you don't post a link to it.  Please provide one link and one link only, lest my eyes dissolve from the horrible futility of gazing upon it.<br/><br/>How was that?<br/><br/>More directly, I'd say that picking the best and most usable bits from other systems will tell you a lot about your own taste and what's important to you in gaming, which is a very useful step in game design.  Depending on your goals, that might be enough, or it might be just step 1 of many.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449134/#Comment_449134" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T03:43:51+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  3:43AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just did not want to get anyone hopes up. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also while my ability to write is doubtful, my ability to read is without question. We live in an age of riches. In recent years I have played and read so my wonderful and masterfully written games, some by the very same people that participate here, that I wanted to clearly state I am not in their class. <br/><br/>The truth is you know that guy. The guy that sits on a couch and after flipping through a new game book casts it aside disdainfully and says "I can do better than that." How many gamers say they are going to write a game, but never do. The only thing that makes me even slight different than that guys is I sat down a wrote a game, but as you know determination does not equal talent. <br/><br/>If you were truly desirous of seeing the drivel I produce it might be arranged.<br/><br/>In any case please allow me to respond directly to your directed comments.<br/><br/>Your thoughts on this topic match my own. On the surface it would seem to be obvious, but it is nice to hear it reflected. <br/><br/>Games are built on the backs of other games. All modern rpgs carry in their DNA a familial resemblance to D&amp;D to a greater or lesser extent. That being said how important is to have real innovation in your rule system? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449135/#Comment_449135" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T04:12:03+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  4:12AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The process you are describing is, simultaneously, arguably a <i>terrible</i> technique for theoretical game design, and a very effective practical shortcut towards the same.<br/><br/>Real innovation is not important in any particular game (although, of course, it would be sad not to see it in game design <i>in general</i>). Some of the best games are most innovative, and others are anything but.<br/><br/>I think a group of designers or design-inclined people (such as many at this forum) are drawn to innovation more than the average gamer. In that sense, it can really help you get some attention for your ideas or your game.<br/><br/>Otherwise, innovation holds fairly little inherent value; the goal of producing a good game (for whatever audience - making a game you really enjoy playing and no one else does is a perfectly valid goal) should always override it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449136/#Comment_449136" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T04:14:05+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  4:14AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would also recommend you - if you really do wish to talk about your crappy game - to post some kind of material for people to look upon in disgust.<br/><br/>However!

I can't think of too many games that can do this well (although Dread comes to mind), and the focus on everyday-life-touched-by-the-supernatural is a really good one, standing out from many other "typical" roleplaying games.<br/><br/>* The photography and literary quotes catch my attention, in a good way. I don't normally enjoy reading quotes, but in this case I did. (Although I skipped the incredibly long one.)<br/><br/>* The basic character creation is pretty solid; I particularly liked the "how are you broken?" and "how you are tied?" questions, since they lead very directly into what we're going to be doing in the game. Lots of good stuff there.<br/><br/>* The breakdown of the genre, cliches, and story types is very thoughtful. It seems like you really know the genre and you are good at discussing it, including plenty of examples for illustration and inspiration.<br/><br/>* The idea of Boons is promising. A sort of "Achievements"-type structure, with potential for continuing bonuses if you explore them further. There's some food for thought there, and potentially a really fun tool for game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449147/#Comment_449147" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T13:34:23+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  1:34PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure why the file was gone but I reloaded it again.

A disclaimer: I haven't checked the links, just this discussion.<br/><br/>Re-assembling bits from existing works into a new whole = game-design.<br/>Corollary: anybody who touts their creative process as being free of the above is probably a liar.<br/><br/>Innovation for innovation's sake = useless.<br/>Historically, in RPGs, innovation-for-innovation's-sake yielded things like: "Look! My Runequest/Gurps clone uses a d36 for skill checks! I've even patented it."<br/><i>Actual</i> innovation is borne of problems: you try to solve an actual problem you're facing using whatever tools you already have \u2014 and end up developing a new, customized tool in the process.<br/><br/>No design is done in a vacuum. Or, rather, design in a vacuum as much as you wish, but those designs are never going to get out of the vacuum-zone.<br/>For <i>real</i> game-design, there's an audience you're designing for/from (otherwise, there can be no actual problems to solve, right?).<br/>An anecdote: surprisingly often, game-designers have no idea who their audience is (which doesn't mean they don't have one). A piece of advice: identify your audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449183/#Comment_449183" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-28T22:03:34+00:00" title="October 28, 2015 10:03PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu all the points you made were good ones, especially the ones about problems and audience.<br/><br/>My latest game was designed with the intent of providing a more classical style game (a gm running a game for players) for GM's with as much of the games arithmetic transmuted to prose as I could stand. <br/><br/>The game was to allow character creation in a very minimal amount of time. Insure that the characters were appropriate to the genre (Hollywood ghost films) both in theme and power level. And have game systems simple enough and and written in such a manner that the GM could explain them to the players using common terms without the player ever needing to look at the rule book.<br/><br/>I envisioned the audience for this game to be GMs that wished to run games for players that were not from a traditional gaming background that might be intimidated, confused (or in the case of my wife) unimpressed with the math to be found in a lot of main stream rpgs. <br/><br/>Whether I achieved those goals is up for debate. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449184/#Comment_449184" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-28T23:42:09+00:00" title="October 28, 2015 11:42PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did <i>you</i> achieve those goals in your actual play experience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449185/#Comment_449185" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-29T02:09:00+00:00" title="October 29, 2015  2:09AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To a large extent yes, but then again I am easy to please.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/raytracer" title="raytracer"><img alt="raytracer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/raytracer">raytracer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449444/#Comment_449444" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-13T09:49:09+00:00" title="November 13, 2015  9:49AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What kind of stories would the players be involved in with Domicile?
