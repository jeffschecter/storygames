It looks to be an excellent design and may be precisely what I have been looking for to cover several objectives.<br/><br/>However, from an objective stance, I find The Pool is terribly vague in one key matter. Namely, what the GM is supposed to be doing. I gather that the unspoken assumption is that he is to present situations to challenge and engage the players like in a traditional RPG, but there really isn't any mechanical support for it. The only thing I see is that the GM gets to mandate dice throws (despite claims otherwise, since the GM has say over whether a player description happens automatically or needs to be rolled for). Other than that, I don't see what the GM's role is in the pool.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81336/#Comment_81336" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T15:08:48+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  3:08PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recommend you write up a one-sheet, describing the game world and the situation. In play, you frame scenes, and create and play the NPCs, and most importantly, you use events and NPCs to drive meaningful antagonism at the player characters. You hit them with stuff that brings out the conflicts they've built into their characters. Your job is to hit them with such awesome situational and NPC antagonism that every conflict is a struggle for them not to gamble everything from their pool, and not to choose the Monologue of Victory when they're successful. Toward this, I recommend having all the players give their characters Sorcerer style Kickers. It'll help you get things started.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you give out bonus dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81337/#Comment_81337" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T15:24:22+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  3:24PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi E., <br><br>You.... have bounced my brain around.<br><br>I first hit The Forge when The Pool was first published.  I mean... years ago.  <br/><br/>And since then there's been all this talk about what GM's <i>do</i>.  I mean, sure Universalis took the GM <i>out</i> of the game.  And sure, games like <i>Sorcerer</i> often changed what what a GM did -- but there was going to be a lot of hashing before a lot of us got clear how different some of those responsibilities would be while remaining very much a standard GM in many other ways.  (I've missed some other games already out by then, of course..)<br/><br/>And then there's been this <i>flood</i> of games which have been crazy.<br/><br/>And then a ton of concentrated yakking about what the GM does, and doesn't do.  And distribution of authority.  And techniques.  And new rules.  And putting the role of the GM on the table and really taking it apart in the last few years that basically was unprecedented... at least to me. <br/><br/>And then you come back here with the little Pool and point out this blunt failing of the game, and I'm think, "Jeez, there's no way James could have known what he was supposed to know to write out what the GM does in 2007.  <i>Because back when this came out, everyone knew what a GM was supposed to do!</i>"<br/><br/>Christopher                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81340/#Comment_81340" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T15:36:56+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  3:36PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I cross-posted with Paul.<br/><br/>Since Paul posted suggestions for actually inserting actions for the GM, here's a list I wrote up on RPG.net thread <i>four years ago.</i>  ( <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=51844&amp;page=9" rel="nofollow">Tell Me About Sorcerer</a> )<br/><br/>On the thread, SteveD was saying that because players wrote their own Kickers, the GM simply had nothing to do and could only sit back and watch the game.  Think how crazy things are now!  (Hello Dogs! Hello PtA!  Hello Roach!)<br/><br/>Here, in part, was my reply, which pretty much matches Paul's comments:<br/><br/><i>* The GM is in charge of the scene framing<br/><br/>* The GM is in charge of the Bangs, which are the new complications that drive the PCs to greater danger, drama and tension.<br/><br/>* The GM will have created the Relationship Map, which means he's designed the major NPCs and how they're interconnected.<br/><br/>* He framed the initial game creation session, which means he's arrived and established most of the background and world parameters, as well as a big chunk of the theme and mood issues.</i><br/><br/>For the record, it was a 13 page thread, so things like Kickers, Bangs and Relationship Map were pretty well hashed out.<br/><br/>But think about that -- simply the introduction of Player written Kickers was the Earth being moved from the center of the universe for some people.  There's been a lot of great work done with new games and ideas, but traveling back in time this way has made it clear to me how much has changed in our expectations of games in a very short period of time.<br/><br/>Christopher                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81342/#Comment_81342" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T15:58:35+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  3:58PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher, you just pointed out the thing that's driving me nuts about the story-games medium, the fact that it takes an awareness of close to ten years of wide and varied debate to know the answer to even some of the most basic questions.

So I came with a setting &amp; scenario in mind, and I defined clearly for the players what style I was going for and some suggested themes. (In other words I made it clear their characters should care in some degree of Journalism, The Truth, and stuff like that. Given that, a character could plug into the plot pretty easily.)

Yup.<br/><br/>Each game that comes out is its own yummy morsel of fun.<br/><br/>But the texts often carry assumptions of things "everyone knows how to do."<br/><br/>And often use the same words, but in different contexts or uses.<br/><br/>Or handle something in such a way that player A knows from game B, and tries to port the other usage of the technique into game C.<br/><br/>I'm not laying blame here are saying the games suck.  I'm saying, this is the reality.  <br/><br/>I'll also say Story games are complicated by the fact that they are a mix of system and story <i>craft</i>.  That is, it is possible to have a good Bang and a bad Bang.  This is, in my view, not a bad thing, but simply the part of the challenge of playing them.  Only through practice and experience can people sift through what can only come down to <i>aesthetic</i> issues. <br/><br/>The issue of aesthetics can be side-stepped by having very tight rules where the color simply doesn't matter -- players can add details but they have no thematic or narrative weight; no impact on actual play or the other players.<br/><br/>But if the color and creative choices is going to affect Players (either as a GM providing a Bang of one kind or another, or a player doing it to another player), the matter of quality of the creative act is part of the challenge and fun of Story games. <br/><br/>So we have not only the issue of making the rules and techniques clear, but the issue of craft and art.<br/><br/>Okay.

As you point out, see RPG.net.  Or  The Forge.  Or here.<br/><br/>I would say, in regard to E.'s points, Nar play (which may or may not be the same thing as Story Games), has a whole raft of new issues that have been floated to play.<br/><br/>I would also say that the bar has been set higher at communities like this: people are expected to make distinctions about this technique versus that technique.  Simply have a "My GM sucks thread," and a "Why Players Suck" thread won't cut it.  And that means everyone's got to be more on their toes.<br/><br/>Which still leaves a problem of how to communicate this.  <i>Dogs in the Vineyard </i>does one of the best jobs of explaining itself I've ever seen from an RPG.  That doesn't change the fact that while it's very friendly to both a new-comer to RPGs and old hands, I can imagine dropping the book in the middle of unsuspecting teenagers would leave them on occasion say, "Well, let's try this part this way..."  <br/><br/>After all, the internets are full of people assuming you have to ply conservative jack-asses with guns or the GM determines the objective morality of the game.  Compare that that the lack of confusion over the rules for Monopoly or Chess or Rainbow Six Vegas.  (And I'm not saying it's the fault of Dog's text; I'm saying the issues and concepts at work in a Narrativist game are subtler and trickier than in a solid Gamist game.)<br/><br/>This whole RPG <i>is</i> kind of strange.

It seems like a lot of the problems that I often see people mention have more to do with their history playing other games (often traditional RPG) and the expectations and habits the bring from those games to Story Games. I suspect that if you come to Story Games fresh many of these questions would never occur to you. You won't make assumptions based on other games you've played. You can accept the game text at face value instead of trying to reconcile it with your experience playing D&amp;D or Gurps. While a lot of the debate you ae talking about does come from vauge or inprecise text, a lot of it comes from assumptions and expectations based on past experience. I think.<br/><br/>I don't mean that this solves every problem. It doesn't. But I've seen people who have never played an RPG pick up and play a Story Game without any real problems (or the same kind of problems you'd get trying to play Monopoly for the first time). I've also seen plenty of veteran gamers pick up the same Story Game and not know how to approach it because it's so different from what they know. It doesn't behave in ways the want it or expect it to behave. Past game experience and the expectations that it creates can really be barriers to trying any kind of new game.<br/><br/><br/>jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81417/#Comment_81417" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T07:39:35+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  7:39AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2007 7:41AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think we also need to learn to separate (1) roleplaying games as instruction manuals (a text that gives you just the rules) from (2) roleplaying skills (techniques of social interaction and story-telling that players and GMs bring to the table).  Many games give a whole lot of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but as John Harper has said above, much of what falls under <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> goes unsaid or is learned over the course of many years of experience and isn't typically taught by any text.</p>\n<p>The real question seems to be, even if a particular game gives you a perfect experience as an instruction manual (e.g. #1), how much of a responsibility does the game designer have to give you a teaching manual on how to be a good roleplayer or GM (e.g. #2)?  Do we really want all texts to tell us what a kicker is and how to best implement it?  Perhaps the designer should at the very least give you hints in terms of how to best handle situations unique to his game.  Moreover, if a player recognizes that a game is Nar or Sim or Gamist (along with other big-time indicators as to focus), then that will also inform his skill set and the way he approaches the game.  But really, I'm just not sure that every game should (or can) give you a rundown on how to "play".</p>\n<p>That said, and as a separate issue altogether, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s certainly a mistake nowadays for a game to exclude a list of responsibilities for the GM and players.  It used to be that there was a default set of responsibilities (GMs do this; players do that, etc.).  Not so anymore.  I think we\xe2\u20ac\u2122re all to the point where games have mucked around with the traditional power structure so much that designers really shouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t make the traditional assumptions \xe2\u20ac\u201c even when writing for experienced players (perhaps even moreso).</p>\n<p>What I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m most interested in is where virgin roleplayers fit into all of this.  They obviously don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t carry the same assumptions that we all do.  A lot of us assume one way or another that new players would either flail or pick up on a game right away.  I wonder how it would all shake out in reality though.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81611/#Comment_81611" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T05:58:47+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  5:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kind of off-topic, but are there any further resources for the Pool?

So often the negative reaction I see to indie/s-g RPGs is less about the game itself being flawed, but that the game doesn't work just like Game X, i.e., challenges the way said critic has been roleplaying for N years.

I mean, if System Does Matter, then I need to know how Kickers work with your ruleset, even if I already know what they are in general practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
