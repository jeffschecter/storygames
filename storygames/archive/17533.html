The PCs are Cyrus Vance (Anne), Lady Blackbird (JB), and Naomi Bishop (Kirk).<br/><br/>Quick racap of events to date:<br/>S1 - The crew of The Owl trick the guard into breaking his face against Naomi's fist. Then steal his clothes. Led by Snargle dressed up as the biggest baddest officer, they, with little difficulty, walk off the Hand of Sorrow. This was a short one.<br/><br/>S2 - A brief chase and impromptu lightning storm later, the cast and crew lose the Hand of Sorrow in the sump clouds below, but not without damage. Landing in Nightport, a "Wretched Hive of Scum and Villany", Cyrus and Kale head off to find parts, while Lady Blackbird and Naomi putz about town looking for a decent comms relay to send word to Uriah. While Naomi breaks faces trying to find good directions, Cyrus teaches children the meaning of bribes and finds the parts necessary to repair the ship. Also finds an imperial recon ship. When they reconnoiter with the Lady and Naomi, they proceed to break skulls, and even get themselves a prisoner!<br/><br/>S3 - Leaving Nightport, Lady Blackbird receives a coded missive from Uriah, Cyrus listens in over the (wide open) comms while the Lady reacts to the message in private, and Naomi gets... creative with her captive. We all imagined "Stuck In The Middle With You" as the soundtrack to that scene. When the Lady hears Cyrus over the comms, though, chaos ensues, including Cyrus bamfing away from the wheel, the ship going upside down, Blackbird almost breaking her leg, and other cool jazz. Luckily the prisoner was in no position to be effected by the ship going pear shaped. After all was sorted, Cyrus makes a vow, as does Naomi. She does not trust him, and he will earn it.<br/><br/>S4 - Heading to Ravensgable, a "Wretched Hive of Scum and Villany. Again," Naomi taps one of her contacts, Torch, to get codes for flying about The Remnants. The Lady, meanwhile, is loving "slumming it", and drinks happily out of a glass that a bartender spit in moments before. Naomi's contact has obviously been tapped, and doses her with Warpblood. Cue fun hallucinations. Followed by Cyrus and Blackbird setting a firestorm upon the tavern, "The Imperial Library," setting it burning to the ground. With the Lady and her drugged bodyguard escaping out the back door, Cyrus has a feeling he knows who's coming.<br/><br/>S5 - The girls bolt to the nearby woods, dragging a bloodied Torch, and find a decent hiding place. The Lady helps Naomi through her drugged state, helping her integrate the warpblood, but passes right out. Meanwhile, Cyrus confronts the bloodhunter on his trail, old friend Kate from his Imperial days, and decides to play as though he's joining the hunt for the Lady as Kate doesn't seem to know she's hired him, tracked her scent here the old fashioned way. Trying to lead her and her Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum into a pinscer, knowing roughly where Naomi and Blackbird were headded. Of course, hearing them coming and not trusting Cyrus as far as she could throw him, Naomi sets up and ambush thinking he's betrayed them. One hilarious set of circumstances later, involving Cyrus getting his jaw busted, and we're back on the ship with two pints of Bloodhunter's Blood. The session ends with an exceptionally touching moment between Cyrus and The Lady. <br/><br/>S6 - After the very heady, potent scenes we ended up with in the past couple sessions, we decided to take it lighter. Trip to Cloud City, 'A Wretched Hive of Scum and Villany, but higher class," to get a doctor who can transfuse blood well and help it bond mystically, so Cyrus can become a Bloodhunter. Enter 'Dr "John Smith's" Barber-Chirurgeon Workshop.' Of course, having an 'excellent medical professional' is only part of the deal. The operation goes well, but Cyrus's warpblood fights off the new blood, sending him into a comatose dream state, where he faces off against a hallucination of Kate. After bringing himself back to reality, new blood infused, all of the bright colours and grand smells, they head for brunch. Not just any brunch, though, a good proper (American, not English) High Tea. Fake invitations and a google search for everyone's best formal wear later, they went on their way to Lady Cosgrove's Tea up in the blue sector. Of course, obviously things go hilariously wrong. The man who sold Naomi into slavery is there, for example, and Cyrus is unknowingly making very buddy buddy with him. And Count Carlowe, Lady Blackbird's betrothed, is also in attendance, along with his "young ward". This all led to Naomi locking the Lady in a closet before she even got her tea (first in months!), and dragging Vance and the Offender into the kitchen. Kitchen staff being kitchen staff and knowing what's what, well, they made scarce. "I hear a delivery truck" "I gotta check something in the office". You know the drill. Beating the poor sod against the floor until he stopped trying to scream, things got a lot more heady. Touching scene between Vance and Naomi, involving Naomi trying to get Cyrus to prove himself to her by killing this man, and Cyrus telling her no good will come of it. Slamming the knife she's holding into the tile floor, she breaks down crying, buying off her vow, as well as her hate of the Empire. Meanwhile the Lady manages to free herself, and begins mingling with Lady Cosgrove, and finally gets her tea. <br/><br/>Fun times! I think I'm going to have Uriah Flint sack Cloud City next, to shake things up a little. We're all really enjoying this game, along with the Lady Blackbird Companion, and our respective gaming histories are making things very interesting. Outside of me either Foreshadowing Future Badness, Putting Folk In A Spot, and Offering Ugly Choices, I don't have to do a whole lot. Usually I drop a name and a vague association, and my wonderful players run with it and turn it into something fantastic. I can't wait for next session!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397554/#Comment_397554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T21:27:53+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  9:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome sauce.

Camp it up a little, to move aside the drama that finished last session off and not bring in anything too big. I reached deep into my bag of stock characters for this. Every bad accent and stereotyped name and situation. During at least one part "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ" rel="nofollow">Yakkity Sax</a>" was playing in our heads, and in another Kirk was repeating my lines in a fantastic Tom Waits impression since I wouldn't actually do the voice. <br/><br/>Anyway, so we picked up where we left off, though we undid the buyoff of the Empire key as Naomi wanted to explore it more and felt rebuying it would defeat the purpose of the buyoff. The Lady was presumed to be enjoying tea and avoiding Count Carlowe (and we'll find out exactly what happened next time). Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Naomi and Cyrus are trying to sort out what to do with the snivelling man below them. After some deliberation (amongst which they decided to call him "Kelly" until further notice) they decided it would be best to strip him, tie him up with his own shredded clothes, and then trot him out the back door hidden in a catering cart. Bonus, free canapes! Anyway, ambling quickly towards the elevator down to "Red Level," our intrepid heroes attracted unfortunate attention while bluffing their way past the guard. Specifically, the guard decided to escort them to "him," which they were trying to use like it were an ominous pass code. <br/><br/>An attempt to lose him by turning off the wrong way goes disastrously wrong, and they end up cornered by a batch of street thugs, led by a burly man with a voice that "sounds like gravel and whisky put through a coffee mill." Moments of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tINWl0gzQWI" rel="nofollow">Gun Kata</a> later, along with "Kelly" screaming through his bonds, Vance decided to try to lead everyone back to The Owl by "following Snargle's scent... Goblins have a distinct smell, right?". New Bloodhunter Powers Go! Aaaaaand catastrophic failure. Cue goblin bordello. "Well, someone in there will be able to give us directions, right? I proceed to describe in beautiful vagaries the sights in a shapeshifters' den of iniquity... along with Kale Arkam! Yay! In an opium induced haze. Being... serviced. "Please tell me that's not Snargle..." Luckily Snargle is apparently back watching the ship and the prisoner (who has had a very uncomfortable several weeks, by the way). Head-in-a-barrel-of-ice-cold-water Scene, with Naomi doing the forcible dunking and Cyrus intermittently giving a grand commanding speech. <br/><br/>With a mostly sober Kale leading the way, our dynamic duo head out to finally drag their prisoner back to The Owl. "Wait. Who was guarding Kelly?" What was about to be a chase scene becomes, "Hey! He ditched without paying!" and big burly goblin bouncers proceeded to pummel the gentleman down the way. Begging for his life, "Kelly" offered Vance and Naomi navi codes for the Remnants. They just had to go to "Him". Short travel later, they arrive at "Vincenzo's", as stereotypical a Mafia-Style pasta joint as can be, complete with table of shady goons and a large man eating fazool. They head in through the back door, though, and come face to face with an entirely different breed of cook. Big, ugly, one of them has a cigar clutched between two fingers in his knife hand while cutting onions, and they both stop and look critically at Naomi and Vance. Luckily Naomi's reputation gets them though, and with "Kelly's" introduction they enter bargaining with "The Man," and Naomi's superb bargaining skills saw them through to getting the codes. Stepping outside, "Well, back to The Owl... wait... where the hell is Kale!?". Cut to a short while later back at The Owl, with Kale sleeping off whatever concussion Naomi has left him with, Snargle tending to his "Goblin Kombucha" sludge, and the unnamed prisoner waking up, and being quite shocked to see another unnamed prisoner (who hasn't yet appeared on screen), also bound and gagged. Naomi and Cyrus have a good chat, ending with, "So... brunch?" <br/><br/>Good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398490/#Comment_398490" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T02:29:43+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  2:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Not just any brunch, though, a good proper (American, not English) High Tea. </blockquote>\nWhat's the difference?

Snargle has a very deranged idea about what it's supposed to be. As a quest that took five sessions, I think it might be one of the longest personal character arcs I've personally had, at least for what would normally count as a side-quest.
