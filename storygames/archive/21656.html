For instance, a 12th-level assassin has a 45% chance of killing a 12 HD opponent. In contrast, that's not true at all for the 5e assassin - that same match-up is a 1% chance, and, in many other cases, isn't possible at all.<br/><br/>I wonder about the assumptions, as well. Like, what kind of assassin's weapon deals a d8 in damage? Do high-HD enemies really tend to have an AC of 10?<br/><br/>I remember this issue coming up, in fact, when I played 5e, and it was one of the things which turned me off the game:<br/><br/>It feels to me that the game has made such an effort to include various "cool" abilities, that it has forced the designers to increase all the numbers to match, while leaving the baseline the same.<br/><br/>For instance, my character (5th level, for what it's worth) snuck up behind a bandit guard (effectively 0-1 HD) with his knife. I wanted to take him down, right? Our 5th-level party could mow these guys down almost effortlessly with our various combat powers. (My character wasn't an assassin, though.)<br/><br/>Stabbing the guard, or slitting his throat, made a great deal of sense in the fiction. However, because all the numbers are slightly inflated, I knew that it was a stupid idea. My dagger deals a d4 in damage, and a typical humanoid has 11 HP. Even with a critical hit, I had no chance of taking him down.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I remember how we dealt with this back in my D&amp;D days (it was 2nd Edition!), and it worked pretty well:<br/><br/>I don't know if you recall the wave of supplementary rules which appeared in D&amp;D around that time, but there were a LOT of them. Between us, we had a lot of sourcebooks and optional rules.<br/><br/>So, what I ended up doing to reconcile the mismatch of hit points and obviously dangerous and frightening situations was to allow an automatic critical hit in the "Combat &amp; Tactics" book, which had horrifying tables of effects for such terrible wounds. You could lose a limb or an eye or be bleeding to death, etc, and there were different tables for every different type of damage (bludgeoning, impaling, etc).<br/><br/>This worked pretty well, because it was scary but still usually non-lethal - get stabbed in the back, don't bother defending against an attack, fall from a great height... roll an effect from the critical hit table.<br/><br/>The "hit point conundrum" is always tricky in D&amp;D! Fun to consider various solutions, often from many different directions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473811/#Comment_473811" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T15:46:31+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  3:46PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2018 3:50PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I do find it meaningfully different, though, that a 1e assassin always has decent odds pf killing an opponent of a similar "level" this way.

I'm not familiar enough with 5th edition to say how much of a damage bonus an assassin may expect to gain, but I assume that it's substantial, the way the math has been trending in recent editions.<br/><br/>My simple and generic ideal for the assassination odds thing is that while anybody should be capable of amassing a 1d6 damage blow against another character, it should also be possible to gain as much as say 3d6 with nothing but surprise and careful planning - that's just "realism thinking" based on what hit points mean in the simulation, what the genre of the game is and what's possible for humans to do and so on. Perhaps double that for a character dedicated to surprise murder - an assassin. However, I don't mind it if the lethalness of assassination caps out at roughly that level: once you have over 20 hit points, I'm cool with the idea that you "cannot be assassinated" in the sense of being taken down without a chance to react. (Not without supernatural means, anyway.) I think that D&amp;D genuinely works better if higher-level characters are more resistant to death; the game is supposed to turn more romantic and cinematic and dramatic at higher levels, and a high-level player character - or a NPC for that matter - getting one-shotted without warning by an assassin is contrary to this design goal. If we want grim and gritty even at high levels (which I consider e.g. 8th level to be), then the scaling hit-points and such are a mistake to begin with.<br/><br/>(Perhaps the biggest problem in having assassination remain a highly feasible tactic at high levels: once the 15th level Fighter has their 100 hit points, isn't it pretty wonky how killing that same guy by throwing him off a building is impossible, and killing him by sending in swordsmen by the dozen is impossible, but a lone assassin with a dagger can still put him down in his sleep? Is that normal to you, wouldn't you expect that fighter guy to do the movie hero thing and wake up at the last moment to engage in a quick and desperate nigh-time duel? Of course you can still kill them, and the assassin might well not understand the rules of the world they live in, but we as players know that the guy with a 100 hit points won't be going down without an extended action sequence.)<br/><br/>This is all to say that I rather favour the 5th edition assassination math over the 1st edition. I am not in love with the stupid weapon-based damage dice and the assassination damage being weapon-based, because that means that the best assassin tool at mid-to-high levels is what, a Great Maul or something like that? But the principle is solid, and it makes being caught unaware very serious at low levels, but merely a dramatic set-back at high levels, which is just fine with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473812/#Comment_473812" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T15:49:00+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  3:49PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2018 3:53PM by Paul_T.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, good points.

I just barely might make them 1st level if it's some sort of an elite force, or we could be playing a module that has weirdly statted guards, but most of the time if it's a no-name "normal human" then you will find a dagger to the throat producing the expected results.<br/><br/>I might as well throw in my own assassination rule while we're at it - this is the current one, it's something that I've fiddled with a lot over the years: a successful attack against an undefending opponent (whatever reason, doesn't matter if you're using social surprise or invisibility or attacking a sleeping foe) immediately "bypasses hitpoints", causing a death save and likely death. This surprise effect can be countered by an immediate expenditure of 10 hit points, in which case the successful attack is treated normally. In other words: you can pay 10 hit points to "wake up at the last moment" or "just have a feeling" or what have you.<br/><br/>(As a point of general interest, I'm considering just outright allowing characters to cancel any status effect targeting them by paying 10*[spell level] hitpoints to shake it off. Seems like a good guideline for ensuring that the mechanical hygiene of the game works and zillionth-level superheroes don't get taken down by some piddly "it's Sleep but I forgot to put in a level limit" 1st level spell.)<br/><br/>You can see the intent of my rule in the above exegesis: I think that D&amp;D's intent is not for high level characters to die to sudden strikes, and I think that D&amp;D mainly measures high-levelness via the hitpoint currency. If you can afford to pay my 10 hp "combat awareness tax", I'm fine with glossing over the mortal danger just like a movie combat sequence would.<br/><br/>The way this works, you would be justified viewing my rule as "a successful surprise attack causes +10 points of damage." The difference is rather technical. I have various other crunch (feats and stuff) that characters can use to try to extend the feasibility of assassination to higher levels, but ultimately my design goal is for a surprise attack to be absolutely lethal at low levels while merely being a flashy way of starting a fight at high levels, so don't expect to ever do an instant death assassination strike or something like that.<br/><br/>An untested idea regarding high-level assassination, though: I could see some sort of a "deadly courtier" character build that gets to pile up "secret damage" while lulling their victim to a false sense of security during a social encounter. Sort of like assassin shrouds in 4th edition D&amp;D: you spend rounds doing things that are not technically speaking "attacking", but that nevertheless guarantee that when your attack comes, it will cause an abnormal amount of hp damage.<br/><br/>(In case you didn't get what I mean with "secret damage", it's simply hp damage that occurs without the victim realizing that it's happening. For example, dulling your victim's senses with subtly poisoned wine to make them easier to take down later. It's a way to make a high-hp target a bit softer before the decisive takedown.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473821/#Comment_473821" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T18:45:47+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  6:45PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I very much like the "secret damage" approach (and Sandra does a similar thing with her rules for missile weapons).

Mages have wards, defensive spells, mind reading, familiars and gargoyles guarding them from attack. Fighters have stone walls, food tasters and loyal guards (perhaps a decent level henchman) and likely a mage friend who has placed a few wards too. If an assassin can penetrate those barriers they have already had to subvert them in secret by charming the guards, dispelling the wards and scaling the walls.<br/><br/>Sure, a determined foe could hide in a crowd with a scroll of Disintegration or an Arrow of Slaying but that would be an expendable asset who would most likely get captured and interrogated (or since this is D&amp;D, slain and interrogated). If the threat it known crowd may not stand closer to the overlord than Disintegration distance (this is why your security advisor should be a mage or a high level thief).<br/><br/>The age old debate of whether sleeping in armor is realistic can be asked in the inverse, is it realistic for a high profile character not to surround themselves with 100,000gp worth of security?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473829/#Comment_473829" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T20:13:59+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  8:13PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Or do you have a philosophy around this distinction, as well?</p></div></blockquote>\nMainly my philosophy is that I want to have my cake and eat it too [grin].<br/><br/>Specifically, I want both of these to be true at once:<br/><br/><b>Circumstances matter:</b> When you're run over by a train, you're fucked. You cannot avoid being run over by a train with a "character build", you actually have to keep away from the tracks.<br/><br/><b>You cannot short-circuit the combat mechanics:</b> When somebody has a lot of hit points, the correct play should not be discarding the concept of "attack" and relying solely on attracting your enemy to play on the railroad tracks in the hopes of having them run over by a train. It should still be strategically and tactically meaningful for high-level combat to evolve into proper wuxia bullshit, rather than evolving into "who fails their saving throw first".<br/><br/>Now, the problem is that affirming one of these principles does not actually do anything to resolve the problem inherent in the other. Rather, they seem pretty contradictory to each other, don't they? How can we have a game where you can have real ploys while also ensuring that those real ploys do not become the only game in town? On 1st level it's easy, because your enemy is just as dead after a sword stroke as they are after a snake bite - one's just an unlucky damage roll, the other's an unlucky poison save. On 10th level, though, playing by orthodox rules with minimal innovation, my Fighter frankly stops even <i>carrying</i> a sword - that's a fool's game against enemies like Giants, with dozens and dozens of hit points; the real winner carries sacks full of poison snakes for those sweet save-or-die effects. Or thrown potions, or a severed medusa head, or <i>whatever the GM will allow me to have</i> that gives me spell-like effects that bypass hit point math.<br/><br/>You see the problem, yes? If we accept that save or die even exists as a concept, and if we assume that an "attack" genuinely does not grow in strength as quickly as hit points scale, then what is one to do to prevent characters from starting to rely on anything and everything that bypasses the hit point math in favour of attriting the enemy's hit point pile?<br/><br/>(Why do the attacks not scale with hit points? In modern D&amp;D they do, because modern D&amp;D strives for the idea that combats should last 3-5 rounds at every level, and be essentially the same throughout the level range - numbers grow bigger all around, but the outcomes are the same. I believe this to be an error as regards the best nature of D&amp;D; the game is more true to its overall picture if high-level combats grow naturally longer, and characters are more protected from sudden death due to having a greater HP buffer in relation to attack strength; high-level D&amp;D combat should be less luck-based and more strategic and even dramatic, there should be room for a character to simply swashbuckle a few rounds while looking for their opening without it being a big deal. To achieve this, though, we must accept that a 10th level Fighter may have ten times they hit points, but they do <i>not</i> hit for ten times the damage. They probably hit a bit harder than a 1st level Fighter - feats and magic weapons and whatnot - but not as much harder as their staying power has grown.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473830/#Comment_473830" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T20:14:05+00:00" title="May 11, 2018  8:14PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2018 8:17PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Assuming that I've articulated the problem clearly, my best solution to it so far is as follows - and I certainly invite anybody with a better idea to tell me!<br/><br/><b>Mechanical localism</b> (name I just invented) is the design principle that certain ideas of warfare in D&amp;D are essentially tier-relevant, and should not be expected to be feasible over the entire power range potentially used in the game. <i>Sleep</i> is a classical example of a mechanically localized spell: it is explicitly effective only against enemies with 4 HD or less, doing nothing against stronger opponents. It is something that very much has its place in the goblin dungeon, but a wizard who brings that one to the Grand Convocation of the Druidic Order will not be successful in the eldritch duels therein.<br/><br/>I'll note that 4th edition D&amp;D is very explicit about embracing mechanical localism as a design principle; it is massively concerned about ensuring that characters use level-appropriate combat powers. I'm not directly influenced in my thinking here by 4th edition, but it's a good parallel example of how somebody might go about working this stuff out.<br/><br/>There are certain mechanical flags around which mechanical localism can be constructed in D&amp;D. Arbitrary HD limits like in the Sleep spell are just one crude way to go. <i>Power Words</i> are a subtler example: if you currently have X or more hit points, they do nothing, while otherwise they fuck you up rather severely.<br/><br/>There are also strategic concepts in D&amp;D that are only relevant against high-level enemies. Often this is because they are simply horribly inefficient and unnecessary at low levels. Some are nice and flavourful, like how magical dueling can become a flashy counter-spelling exercise or strategic guessing-game, but too often these are stupid things like how it's easier to wrestle, disarm and tie up a high-level knight than it is to fight them.<br/><br/>The "hit point cancel" that I referenced above in the context of assassinations is something I've been pondering in this context: if all dangers in D&amp;D had an implicit "cancel cost", that could, if correctly calibrated, bring about a happy medium between the two desirable principles I mentioned at first: if a 1 HD poison snake's save-or-die poison would instead of "die" cause 10 points of damage, that would be the same as death for most low level characters, but without making that snake a <i>better weapon against a high-level threat than a sword</i>.<br/><br/>I've come to believe that D&amp;D probably needs to go all the way on this and make hit points the truly universal safeguard of character, while simultaneously keeping those cancel costs <b>harsh</b> in a level-parity context. Like, you can opt to take 10*[monster HD] damage instead of suffering their special attack outcome. That kind of harsh - that's much more damage than an equivalent-level Fireball, it's so much damage that the only situation in which doing the "cancel" even makes sense is when somebody is trying to get you on a technicality, with a low-level threat.<br/><br/>I emphasize that I never, ever want for it to become common that a tier-appropriate tactic gets "tanked". However, I can accept it when the dice get lucky - after all, I can accept characters tanking sword blows, so why not other things? If you can survive a 1d6+10 damage assassination strike, well, perhaps you're just past the level of awesome where that sort of thing gets you. We can accept your character being too cool to die when they get showed off a roof, so why not be able to avoid assassination - narrowly avoiding a surprise attack (and losing hit points in an abstract way to pay for it) is such an action movie hero move that those movies don't even bother to stop and explain it. The audience just accepts that <i>of course</i> this hero's story didn't end here just because a jungle cat surprised them.<br/><br/>Also, note something very important here: all those status effect attacks <i>are still supposed to be useful</i> in the high-level combat environment that I envision. Sure, bind the high-level fighter's wrists; sure, poison them; cast Hold Persons on them. They might break the bonds, avoid the snares and shrug off the spells, but that 20 hp they paid to cancel that Hold Person is a fuckload better than a swordstroke at 1d6 in terms of getting them down to a hp range where you actually <i>can</i> hold them down. I'm not trying to take away tactics so much as ensuring that hit points actually are capable of providing some protection to a character.<br/><br/>If all this still causes distress, consider this Fighter class feature:<br/><br/><b>Heroic Reaction:</b> An 8th level Fighter gets the extraordinary ability to retry a save by paying 10 hit points for it. They can also save against effects that do not normally allow it in this way. Only once per effect.<br/><br/>Would that be better? Note that it's much, much stronger than what I'm envisioning here. Just written as a class feature rather than an universal rule.<br/><br/>How about this one:<br/><br/><b>Heroic Retreat:</b> A 9th level Fighter gets to "cancel" a disadvantageous tactical situation and immediately retreat from an encounter with any followers; declare this retreat on your own initiative. This costs 10 hit points, plus the amount of enemy HD present in the encounter. The cost is doubled if there is no venue of retreat available, and tripled if the Fighter is personally bound, wrestled or otherwise prevented from escaping by immediate circumstance. If the cost is too much, the Fighter is defeated, but their companions still escape.<br/><br/>Note that this is all basic wuxia stuff, you wouldn't blink an eye if a sword saint in a movie did these things. So is an 8th level Fighter allowed to be a fantasy hero in the way the dramatic fiction has it, or are they destined to die in the ditch like their 1st level peers?<br/><br/>I hope it's obvious why I don't find the traditional remedies compelling, by the way: it is ultimately futile to try to patch a leaking ship one patch at a time when the cause of the leaks is left unaddressed. This is precisely what early D&amp;D tried to do, mostly by adding spells and magic items that would protect high level characters from low level threats: you wouldn't have to fear poison snakes after getting a Cure Poison spell. That's clumsy, though, isn't it? Is it really a good idea to harness not only the game designer and the GM, but also the players, in a never-ending alligator repellent arms-race? First it's poison, then it's disease, then it's mummy rot... I don't think that this is a meaningful flowering of game mechanics when all we really want is to ensure that a 10th level character cannot be one-shotted by trivial 1st level spells.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473836/#Comment_473836" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-11T23:25:28+00:00" title="May 11, 2018 11:25PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent stuff, Eero.

A group used to low-level play will find even a mid-level Fighter a concerning thing in combat: why would you expend your combat action for the round on attacking somebody when you <i>know</i> that they're just going to tank that hit? If they're just 3rd level or something then you might hope for a quick take-down by ganging up on them, but pile those levels on, and they become tougher and tougher...<br/><br/>The natural response in almost any rules-set, I think, is to start thinking in terms of action economy warfare: throw a net on them to slow them down, have your strongest guy wrestle them to prevent them from using their deadly sword-attack, have a cow sit on them until the combat's over... anything and everything to prevent them from using their hit points and attack bonus effectively to ruin you. Once you perfect this form of combat, you're basically no longer attacking hit points - you're playing a vague game of "how precisely do I need to describe pushing a needle in the eye of an immobile combatant before the GM admits that they've lost, despite their still having hit points left?"<br/><br/>And all the time as the players plot, the GM has to wrestle with this specter of the spirit of the game: which specific effects can be saved against, which can be thrown off using great strength, which <i>should</i> a high-level combatant be vulnerable against? Is it intentional that the rules don't give a high-level Fighter any real defenses against say large nets that can close them down on round one of combat?<br/><br/>A practical example: <i>Scenic Dunsmouth</i> has a 5th level Fighter in it, a dangerous foe for 1st level characters. When our adventurers encountered him a couple of years ago, one of them opted to attack him with rope, intent on catching a loop around his throat and hang him from a tree. The noose was established successfully. The Fighter in question did not have any particular special abilities in their spec, so no flying out or breaking the rope with superhuman strength or anything like that. Is the combat over once they noose gets in place with a lucky roll and enough force is used to hoist the man in the air to hang, or should a vanilla 5th level Fighter have <i>something</i> that they can do to escape such predicament? If they can, what exactly? At least the concept of hit point cancel gives us a better-balanced rule for saying whether a character can or can't execute a cinematic combat maneuver to get out of a bind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473843/#Comment_473843" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T09:20:40+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  9:20AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He didn't have a dagger to cut the rope?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473844/#Comment_473844" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T09:45:50+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  9:45AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2018 9:46AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't remember off-hand, but I would assume not, as otherwise that's surely what he would have done. That would be the most doable "action stunt" to get out of that particular predicament, realistically speaking. The next-most likely stuff gets into things like pulling yourself up on the rope, which is not feasible if there are a few enemies there ready and willing to pull on your legs and whatnot. Everybody can try to think of other ways to get out of an impromptu hanging in an approved Hollywood fashion - maybe you like kick one of your assailants, get a toehold on their shoulder and kick yourself up to grab the tree branch, or something [grin].<br/><br/>(I'll emphasize that all this wouldn't even be a question if we weren't talking about a game that is explicitly a romantic action adventure thing. If this was real-world logic, the answers would respectively be "it's very unlikely to loop a noose around somebody's neck mid-fight, there's a reason why that's not a common combat technique" and "if somebody nevertheless does it, you're done". It's just that we expect D&amp;D combat to work according to certain genre rules, and its procedures explicitly encourage out of the box thinking.)<br/><br/>Thinking about that actual play situation, I wonder how I handled the "called shot" of specifically trying to get a noose over the head of another combatant. It might've been a tactical surprise (as in, the Fighter knew the enemy were there, but the others distracted him while one got him in the noose), or - I'm leaning towards this - they just had several men rush the fellow to limit his movement, grab his arms and generally keep him down long enough to do the deed. The terrain certainly wasn't ideal for normal footwork avoidance, as Dunsmouth is rather boggy all around.<br/><br/>However it was done, though, the general conundrum is the same: should something like that work, and should there be any kind of counter-tactic? Is it OK if that sort of thing is reliable and becomes the go-to method of disposing of high-HP combatants? If a Fighter should be able to do something to get out of it, then what? An Ability check to shrug off the restraints? That's basically the same as the hit point cancel to me, except I like the cancel more because it is more robust in conflict resolution terms - getting out costs you and therefore brings the fight closer to a conclusion. Also, a 1st level Fighter doesn't have the points for it, which I like, because I think that at 1st level you totally should be done when something like that happens to you.<br/><br/>The reason that situation came to mind is, incidentally, that it was when I thought up the concept of the "hit point cancel". I don't remember if I introduced the concept right there mid-fight - could be, because we were playing <i>Dragon Union</i> (a mid-school D&amp;D variant with old school flavour) rather than hardcore old school, and I was using the opportunity to field-test all sorts of mechanical wackiness. It is possible that I at least discussed the idea with the other players then, whether they'd be willing to let the poor murder-psychopath out of the noose in exchange for like 15 hitpoints or something [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473845/#Comment_473845" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T10:59:38+00:00" title="May 12, 2018 10:59AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think that specific counter can be generalised to address the general issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473846/#Comment_473846" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T11:29:12+00:00" title="May 12, 2018 11:29AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a fascinating example.<br/><br/>Isn't the real problem, in a way, allowing any kind of combat-ending outcome based on a roll?<br/><br/>It seems to me that D&amp;D combat only really works if we accept the abstract nature of the hit point counters, or redefine what they mean.

This is what I mean when I say that D&amp;D combat is a perfectly legitimate conflict resolution system, not that different from say Heroquest extended contests (does the newest version still have those, I don't remember). You track your points, and they tell you when the conflict is at an end. There's a lot of organic resolution detail arising from the fictional positioning, but the underlying reality is that you're risking your points against enemy maneuvers, and the subgame ends when one side falls to zero.<br/><br/>A classic advice that tries to salvage a less formalistic interpretation is to never add called shots into your D&amp;D framework. It is an acknowledged problem, similar to critical hits: you might add verisimilitude to your game, but you will also cause corner cases to crop up. If you don't allow called shots, then you won't have to deal with "what if they slip a noose on him" and so on.<br/><br/>I've become convinced through actual play, though, that this maxim about called shots is fundamentally useless. It is only helpful as a superficial stop-gap measure because "called shots" are just one type of possible status effect attack. What about those poison snakes? What about cheap spells? There is no good reason whatsoever to prevent a fighter from doing a called shot to throw sand in an enemy's eyes if you're simultaneously allowing e.g. green slime grenades (an example of a non-spell status effect attack that has appeared in published TSR material). Thinking that you've resolved this kind of issue by forbidding called shots is just saying that it's fair for a wizard to shut down anybody and everybody with a single save-or-die, all day long, while for some reason even realistic tactical maneuvers arising from immediate fictional positioning don't do anything for a fighter.<br/><br/>The logical end-point of forbidding called shots and continuing to forbid everything that side-steps hit point damage is that you kill the positioning-based combat system and get something like the numberless D&amp;D-based video games have: character standing in line, hitting each other in turns, with the only player participation really being the choice of retreat. I know that some prefer to play this way, of course.<br/><br/>So yeah, I strive first and foremost for consistency. Either you remove all status effects from the game and have it play strictly on a HP basis, or you allow everybody to do status effects and accept that fights are won by fictional positioning ("I sit on him until he gives up") rather than hit point damage. I prefer the HP basis because that is in the spirit of the game, which I do not believe dominant status effect attacks to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473849/#Comment_473849" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T12:25:23+00:00" title="May 12, 2018 12:25PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most excellent, Eero. <br/><br/>At some point I will put together the alternate version of D&amp;D, from the opposite direction/angle:<br/><br/>Hit points as an abstract espurce are only for PCs, and even so only in a limited range.

The vast majority of trad style games starting with Runequest and ending with WoD games do precisely this: hit points are a measure of physical well-being, and they can be circumvented by appropriate tactics. They aren't that important, either, as in most games you don't just get more of them for no reason like you do in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>(That bit's important for the big picture: if D&amp;D didn't have scaling hit points, then bypassing hit points with tactical play wouldn't be a problem either, just like it isn't a problem in Runequest. In-built hit point inflation is the single most defining mechanical conceit in D&amp;D, par none. If I had to name one feature of the game that makes it "D&amp;D", then that would be it.)<br/><br/>The history of trad design being so generally disappointing, it's not surprising that this prior art does not actually mean that you couldn't do better. Like, I personally would probably still not equate hit points with physical injury even if I decided to treat them as a non-universal concept.<br/><br/>The primary alternative that I've considered myself has been interpreting hit points as a gestalt measure of real combat readiness, particularly the capability to uphold an armor class by dodging and blocking incoming attacks - a character with hit points remaining is ipso facto capable of doing whatever their combat styles requires them to do to still have an armor class and be able to take combat actions. (Walk around, keep their arms up, etc. for humans.) Physical health plays into it indirectly, but many other things do too, including things like personal balance and whatnot. Characters falling to zero hp are very literally "incapacitated" - not necessarily injured or dead, but unable to act to defend themselves for whatever contextual reason.<br/><br/>The main issue with this type of hit points is that they fluctuate rather wildly. For example, there's no logical reason why a character stepping into a bog shouldn't lose a chunk of their hit points under this interpretation, as they lose tactical mobility. And they should gain them back after moving to hard ground, because "standing in a bog" is not exactly a permanent limitation for your combat capability. Same for a character getting wrapped into a net, or one who's being wrestled, etc.<br/><br/>If this was the definition of a hit point, it would probably be best to treat attacks and other difficulties less as "hit point damage" and more as "hit point commitments": when you are hit by status effects like "standing in a bog" or "injured leg" or "exhausted after a long fight", you commit a number of your hit points to ignoring these difficulties; as long as you can make such commitments, you can keep fighting. Hit points are released from such commitment immediately when the given status effect ends or becomes irrelevant. Injuries are unlikely to end during a combat, while something like "being entangled in a net" could well end once you manage to untangle yourself.<br/><br/>What I like in this HP interpretation is the notion that hit points are very literally a measure of berserk vivacity, which is something that players generally like as a theme in D&amp;D. Your HP number essentially tells us how many nets or nooses you need to be wrapped in to stop you moving and fighting. "My character is so crazy - so many hit points - that he can have two guys wrapped around his legs and still keep fighting."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473853/#Comment_473853" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T13:41:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  1:41PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>"That bit's important for the big picture: if D&amp;D didn't have scaling hit points, then bypassing hit points with tactical play wouldn't be a problem either, just like it isn't a problem in Runequest.

Most of them hit the ground or something else hard and go splat. One guy is buffeted by high winds and lands in a haystack. That sort of thing)<br/><br/>Anyway, it would work like d20/d4. The original article went through all of the basic combos and their reverse, gave average results and high results and the rough equivalents of other die combos.<br/><br/>It meant that while d20/ d4 was roughly equivalent to say d8 damage rolls, occasionally it could pop up with a 20 damage result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473854/#Comment_473854" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T13:45:50+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  1:45PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>On a hypothetical, Old Skool (ish) 1-8 level scale, with significantly smaller portions of the "population" at each higher level, it isn't such a big deal.</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's pretty much my scale.

In other words: how do cardinal Richelieu's men relate to the fact that the musketeers are heroic protagonists, and unlikely to fall prey to their aggression? I would say that the most usual reaction is disbelief in dramatic rules - most people in stories are not "genre-savvy", as ironic awareness is often called. The bad guys don't think that their being little men, un-named goons, adversely affects their performance. They are wrong, whether in stories or in D&amp;D. (At low levels we may be disturbed by how very little edge the heroic 1st level characters have over the goons; at high levels it's the other way around.)<br/><br/>This approach implies that NPCs in my campaign generally don't make plans on the assumption that adventurers are high level and therefore superhuman; they plot as if they were plotting against normal non-leveled people. The exception to this is when a character has an identity or reputation as super-human, which then of course doesn't need to mean that they actually are that: if you're known as a living saint, for example, then don't be surprised if people act on that presumption.<br/><br/>This works the other way around as well in that the players don't really have much strategic basis for assuming heroic levels from NPCs, despite the fact that they know the rules perfectly well. Most NPCs are non-leveled, it's simply not a justified assumption that they wouldn't be exactly as frail as anybody else. The players are justified in thinking that named and "cool" and interesting people usually have levels, but that just means that they relate to them in a very genre-appropriate way, by being more interested in them than the average support character - not unrealistic at all, people generally pay more attention to charismatic extroverts in real life as well. Fighters have a special class ability for evaluating other people's experience levels, but outside of that the only way to really guess at who's got levels and who doesn't is by observing how "protagonist-like" they act. Or you could throw them off a roof and see if they die from 2d6 damage, I guess - most survivors should be at least 2nd level [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473867/#Comment_473867" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T18:13:32+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  6:13PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam,<br/><br/>I like that.

It enables us to have fantastic fights (e.g. between a legendary fighter, a bunch of nameless slaves and a T-rex) which are reasonably fast to resolve and dramatically satisfying, among other things.<br/><br/>So far, I think that nailing down the nature of hit points is a mistake and leads to all sorts of problems (as evidenced by sub-systems, such as healing, which usually do just that).<br/><br/>In the case at hand, I have <b>problems visualizing an experienced fighter getting worn down by a catching loop</b>. So he dodges the noose twice -- cancelling at 10 hp a pop - and is then taken down by the stableboy with a pitchfork? This wouldn't work for me, personally. <br/><br/>I am aware that we could say that he does get the noose around the neck both times, is almost choked to death, his throat a ring of raw flesh, his breath a rasping gasp, but manages to escape, e.g. with Eero's maneuver of getting a toehold on a foe's shoulder and kicking himself up to grab the tree branch. I guess I would then consider the fighter narratively ready for a coup-de-grace by the stableboy.<br/><br/>However, I feel that <b>at some point, evocative descriptions turn into narrative contortions </b>(or I'm playing a Forge-style game, which I occasionally do and like, BTW), not least because we are establishing more and more circumstances to justify what is happening mechanically (again, okay up to a point).<br/><br/>Hence, I'd rather patch the rules to allow for grapples, poison, called shots etc., heavily relying on character level.<br/><br/>I might add - and perhaps it shows that I'm stuck in my ways here - that I think that hit points need to be at least partially grounded in physical terms, their fluid nature notwithstanding:<br/><br/>I describe practically all successful attacks as physically connecting in some way, whether as a scratch, "just a flesh wound" or near-disembowelling. It helps that I envision high-level characters as Hong Kong style action heroes who seem to be brought down by the sheer weight of bullets lodged in their bodies rather than any vital organs pulverized. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473870/#Comment_473870" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T19:49:26+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  7:49PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2018 8:03PM by Krippler.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strangling a heroic fighter with a loop is indeed silly, I would simply allow a Save vs. Paralysis each round (and attempted hanging does 1d6 damage per round) to get free, exactly how it's done is not relevant, a hero would figure something out be it cutting the rope or clenching his throat muscles Gaston-style. He would also be up and swinging till the hitpoints ran out, perhaps with a minor penalty to hit.<br/><br/> One version of <b>Drakar &amp; Demoner</b> has the option of buying the heroic ability <b>Bull Neck</b> for 1 hero point (most abilities cost ~10 points) which makes you immune to hanging.<br/><br/>Don't let people get pinned so easily. I think wrestling someone to the point of pinning them would require alredy depleting their hitpoints through non-lethal damage, even an ogre strength wrestler would only deal 1d3+3 damage per round.<br/><br/>If you worry about save or lose magic/monsters why not make a general rule that at 5th level characters becomes immune to magic and special abilities (like poison or ghoul's paralysis) from spells and creatues of up to 2HD/spell level, perhaps losing a single hit point to represent the miniscule scratch (and to allow an army of 1st level mages casting sleep to eventually wear down a hero). At 7th level it extends to 3HD/spell level, at 9th lvel 4HD/spell level, 11th 4HD and so on. Exceptions would be noted in the monster or spell description (Cloudkill, a 5th level spell, already has the exception that it does not kill 5th level character instantly instead dealing 1 point of damage per round, under this scheme immunity to Finger of Death would kick in at 13th level). <br/><br/>Salt to taste if you think 9th level characters should be safe from Polymorph or not. In this scheme you could even have Disintegrate as a 1st level spell and Disintegrate as a 3rd level spell and so on. A 1st level Disintegrate would actually be less powerful than Sleep if this immunity extends to monsters as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473871/#Comment_473871" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T20:05:33+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  8:05PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The natural response in almost any rules-set, I think, is to start thinking in terms of action economy warfare.</p></div></blockquote>\nThoughts.<br/><br/>Stocks and flows. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow</a><br/><br/>Hit points are a stock. Actions are a flow. Normally the action flow is tied to the flow of hit points out of the stock (delta-HP), implying an approximate turn count until a stock of HP is depleted. Attacking the action flow means you drive up the implied turn count until your own HP stock is depleted, and then everyone agrees "you won't lose for 2000 turns so you win".<br/><br/>Attaching the "10 HP (maybe by level or whatever) to get out of a sticky situation" rule, we disallow attacking action flow disconnect to HP stock, since you can get your actions back by voluntarily lowering your HP stock, aka turn their attack on your actions flow into an attack on your delta-HP flow.<br/><br/>The reason this can work so well is because it's <i>your choice</i> where to take the hit, so if one is way worse for you than the other, you'll take it.<br/><br/>"you can get your actions back by voluntarily lowering your HP stock" -- another way to do this is to say you can always buy additional actions, for a large HP cost? Actions you can take despite conditions? Pay 10 HP, get 1 free action. Feel free to heroic-dying-breath-action.<br/><br/>"Hidden HP loss" feels great for this... pay 10 HP, get out of jail free, and those 10 HP come back if combat's over, because you didn't really take any real damage just "wow we're closer to beating you".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473873/#Comment_473873" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T23:17:20+00:00" title="May 12, 2018 11:17PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very nice description of the structural issue, Guy - that's what I've been grappling to put to words in an understandable way. I want there to be a guaranteed exchange rate from hit points into actions. It doesn't need to be a <i>good</i> rate, it can be so bad that you're only ever going to rely on it as a last resort. But if it's not there, then I cannot believe that attacking the action economy won't be a dominant strategy at high levels.<br/><br/>Also note that the effectiveness of a singular action in D&amp;D combat is calibrated against the default action of attacking for 1d6 damage, at a hit probability determined by attacker skill and defender armor class - so we're talking of an average 1-2 points of damage per action as a practical minimum. That's how "valuable" an action is in the abstract; much of the real tactics in D&amp;D is about increasing the value of your individual action to be something more than that 1 DPT that you can pretty much get by being an angry farmhand with a shovel. You want to be more than that as a competent adventurer, which means engaging the combat encounter in all kinds of ways.<br/><br/>I thought of belaboring the point, but really, I wrote about this too much already, and it's a rather abstract topic about rules-design philosophy coupled to subjective tastes anyway, so I really expect to do more than explain why I find it a noteworthy issue to consider. You all clearly get what the problem is (what I perceive as a problem, anyway), so I'm happy to enjoy hearing about how you, as fellow GM-designers, resolve the paradox.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473874/#Comment_473874" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-13T00:29:30+00:00" title="May 13, 2018 12:29AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe D&amp;D hit point scaling is the reason it took 60+ men and 23 stab wounds to take down Julius Caesar? <br/><br/>Sorry--just a comment from the peanut gallery.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473875/#Comment_473875" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-13T01:58:52+00:00" title="May 13, 2018  1:58AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/kurisu" rel="nofollow">kurisu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Maybe D&amp;D hit point scaling is the reason it took 60+ men and 23 stab wounds to take down Julius Caesar? <br/><br/>Sorry--just a comment from the peanut gallery.<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote>\nThe story goes that Cathal Brugha, the Irish Nationalist rebel, got shot 25 times and survived that particular combat in 1916.<br/><br/>Afterwards, his friends said he had so much metal left inside him that he jingled when he walked. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473884/#Comment_473884" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-13T13:57:02+00:00" title="May 13, 2018  1:57PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I cannot believe that attacking the action economy won't be a dominant strategy at high levels.</p></div></blockquote>\nIn my homebrew DCC game that is exactly the case: Powerful combatants are often brought down by called shots to hamstring, blind or outright decapitate.<br/><br/>Fighters are faced with the (sometimes difficult) choice of joining their comrades in whittling down an enemy's hit points or going for instant-win moves which have a high chance of failure. <br/><br/>It is worth pointing out that the PCs in our campaign usually fight monsters rather than humans. Monsters generally do not have access to (effective) called shots, so hit points work as a pretty reliable buffer <i>for the PCs</i>.<br/><br/>On the rare occasions the PCs go up against similarly-levelled humans, the above-mentioned tactics are used on both sides. Such affairs are very swingy on both sides and have a distinct flavor.

The rules deliver in spades with the low hit points, as one-hit kills are rather common, and getting a hit in is easy as well.<br/><br/>You want high level combats to be <b>plodding</b> and deliberate because that makes room for combat content: combat becomes more complex as there is more space in it for things to happen, and less randomness. The theme is more like wuxia and less like hyper-realistic war movie: the important actors all have names and reasons to be there, and many combats end before the killing blow. Combat between equals is entered with gravitas, because both sides have much to lose.<br/><br/>As I've said before, I think that the really interesting and unique thing about D&amp;D is the way the game shifts from one of those thematic universes into the other gradually, as characters advance, without ever having real top-down rules enforcing it. At some point you just notice that you have so many hit points and contingencies that you're not really in danger of sudden death anymore from mere men with swords.<br/><br/>This atmospheric shift is also not simply one-way, there are ways for low-level combats to turn plodding and high-level combats to turn swingy - and this is a good thing, an excellent thing. For instance I <i>like</i> it that low-level characters can engage in various risk-reduction exercises (improved field chirurgy to save the injured from death, for example), and that high-level characters can find themselves in sudden mortal danger if they face a level-appropriate, epic threat. A dragon with a 30 damage fire breath or something like that is <i>not</i> a plodding threat, it's a sudden return to the swingy world of one-hit death.<br/><br/>This is why I like the idea of guaranteeing high level characters with hit point cancel, but <i>only against inferior threats</i>. The cost of paying yourself out of trouble needs to scale so harshly that it's really just a corner-case solution, such as when a 0th level farmhand tries to assassinate a high-level Fighter. Thence the "10*[level of threat]" hp cost that I've been spitballing - it ensures that a character practically never has the hit point budget to shrug out of a serious, level-appropriate threat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473902/#Comment_473902" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T08:24:39+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  8:24AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2018 8:28AM by Johann.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Johann,<br/><br/>What kinds of rules come into play in those "swingy and distinct" fights against similarly-levelled humans?

It's one of the <a href="http://outforblood1.blogspot.de/2012/07/three-things-i-love-about-dcc.html" rel="nofollow">Three things I love about DCC</a>.<br/><br/>A fighter gets a bonus damage or 'deed' die (ranging from d3 to d8) which may be used for special attacks. These have to be announced before the attack roll and typically have difficulties from 2 (knock prone) to 6 (decapitate). If the deed die fails, the entire attack fails. <b>It's a neat little sub-system which also doubles as a reasonable damage bonus for fighters</b>.<br/><br/>So a 3rd-level fighter has a d5 deed die and might try to cut off an opponent's hand. That's a difficulty of 3, so the fighter must hit the AC and roll a 3, 4 or 5 on the d5.<br/><br/>We have established baseline difficulties for all common maneuvers as well as certain modifiers (targeting a fighter or a large monster typically raises the difficulty by +1) and improvise everything else as it comes up in play (to be referenced later, if we remember).<br/><br/>It is important to note that the nature of the target and circumstances are important. For instance, blinding a cyclops is easier (one big eye) and knocking over a four-legged creature is more difficult. You also need a suitable weapon (a blade to cut off tentacles, a spear to nail someone to the wall etc.).<br/><br/>Characters other than fighters can trade all regular damage for a d2 deed die. Also, the deed die can be increased to the minimum necessary to succeed at a -2 penalty to the attack roll per step.<br/><br/>So a farmhand seeking to decapitate a name-level fighter (or 'slayer') would need to trade all damage for a d2 and increase this to a d8 at a penalty of -12. He'd succeed on an 8 but is not entitled to roll because at -12 he cannot possibly hit the slayer's AC.<br/><br/>Philosophically, <b>special maneuvers should only be profitable if the attacker leverages the circumstances of the situation at hand</b>. If you are fighting an amorphous blob on a featureless plain, the deed die just provides extra damage.<br/><br/>Various creatures have similar attacks (wolves trip, T-rexes swallow etc.).<br/><br/>So far, the rules work as intended: Most of the time, the fighters just inflict extra damage or perhaps set up the party thief for a sneak attack (by knocking a target prone). Occasionally, they go for something specific (e.g. hamstringing a powerful foe to enable a retreat). And against very powerful enemies or in desperate circumstances, they sometimes take the route of going for an instant kill (which usually has a 1-in-8 chance) or de facto equivalent (e.g. immobilizing a foe without ranged attacks, to then be killed at the party's leisure).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473916/#Comment_473916" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T16:33:13+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  4:33PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What are the advantages of using a separate die, over a simpler scheme along the lines of "roll 11+ to deal hp damage, roll 15+ to blind, roll 18+ to decapitate"?<br/><br/>It seems to have the practical advantage of obfuscating the math enough that it's not easy to discern the best choice and stick to it, but that rubs me the wrong way: I'd like choices to be varied, but not randomised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473918/#Comment_473918" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T17:02:48+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  5:02PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds me of a few other systems I've encountered that use random dice rolls for pulling off dramatic maneuvers or stunts.<br/><br/>The Dragon Age RPG has a dragon die. You roll 3d6 + mod for task resolution, but one of your d6's is supposed to be a different color and is your dragon die. You generate a number of stunt points equal to the dragon die's result (so between 1 and 6 points) and bigger and badder stunts require more points to pull off. You can even combine stunts if you have enough points to do so. Some stunts, such as free movement, can be used on a success or a failure as well.<br/><br/>13th Age also has flexible attack roll maneuvers for some classes, but its the bread and butter of the Fighter class. Basically, you have different stunts or special abilities that trigger off different natural die rolls (it uses 1d20 for task resolution). So there are triggers like "natural even roll", "a 16+ hit", "natural odd roll", and so on. Several maneuvers trigger even on a miss, as well.<br/><br/>While these types of approaches are fun and interesting (albeit a little gimmicky), for my personal tastes they sacrifice a lot of player agency before the altar of RNG. I personally prefer approaches where the player knows what they can reasonably do beforehand and has various options (both mechanical and fictional) for increasing their odds of success.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473963/#Comment_473963" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-15T14:20:57+00:00" title="May 15, 2018  2:20PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a lot of cool ideas in this thread, but the 5E stuff is just absolute bunk. (I mean, not Sandra's initial analysis, but everything else). No, assassins don't use Mauls at high levels, because they aren't proficient with them and those weapons use Str, not Dex. Also, more fundamentally, 5E rogues don't really care about the damage die of their weapon, because Sneak Attack damage overwhelms it very, very quickly. The formula is you get 1d6 for Sneak Attack at 1st level, 2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, etc.<br/><br/>But note that on a crit, you roll all damage dice twice. So...<br/><br/>A 1st-level Rogue can definitely one-shot an 11-HP, AC12-15 guard. It's not guaranteed, of course, but the odds are decent.<br/><br/>1d8 for weapon (rapier), 1d6 for sneak attack, +3 for Dex. Oh, but if you get the drop on the poor sucker, you're rolling with Advantage, and any hit is a crit. So...<br/><br/>2d8+2d6+3, for an average damage of 19.<br/><br/>As for the poor, unfortunate 5th-level Sorcerer? Well, if you don't have a melee-range cantrip, such as Shocking Grasp or Sword Burst, then you do need to stand 10 or more feet away... but you can definitely still assassinate the guard. Because at 5th level, <i>your cantrips do 2 dice of damage.</i> So your basic Firebolt hits for 2d10 damage at 5th level... which, against an unaware target, is 4d10 damage, for an average of 22 HP. That would kill even a *PC* (with their special rules for death and dying) with 11 HP!!<br/><br/>Below that level, you don't have much chance of assassinating a guard, but that's just basic niche protection: the Rogue can do that sort of thing from level 1, and some other characters at low level, but everyone else just can't.<br/><br/>And if you didn't take any combat cantrips? Well, then, you're voluntarily relinquishing your role in combat, although as always, one of the places where I do criticize 5E really harshly is for not giving enough good advice. "Take a goddamn combat cantrip" really needs to be in all the casters' sections in the PHB.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Much of the rest of the discussion in this thread that I object to has to do with one fundamental facet of 5E that no one has yet brought up: it doesn't work with one monster against the party. Even tough bosses need a few minions to soak up a few actions early in the fight. <br/><br/>That being said, if you actually use the rules for the toughest monsters, their lairs do shit on initiative count 20, and they can act 1-4 times per round off-turn (depending on their exact "boss" mechanics). Legendary Resistance also acts as exactly the sort of save-or-die ablation Eero wants, etc.<br/><br/>Y'all really, really need to learn how 5E <i>actually</i> works before you keep dunking on it, or making assumptions about it because it happens to follow 3.X/PF and 4E.

I understood that we're mostly just philosophizing about different possible assassination mechanics in D&amp;D. I at least am in no way competent to engage in some sort of charop exegesis of 5th edition. I'm sure it works just fine; everything I've seen of it indicates that it's a pretty carefully considered rules-text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473969/#Comment_473969" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-15T17:09:49+00:00" title="May 15, 2018  5:09PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a bunch of stuff from towards the beginning of the thread where y'all were dumping on 5E.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473974/#Comment_473974" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-15T21:31:14+00:00" title="May 15, 2018  9:31PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry about that, then - we didn't know what we were saying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473979/#Comment_473979" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-15T22:38:22+00:00" title="May 15, 2018 10:38PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5E delivers a lot of the things you say you want. Especially with the way monsters designed to be solos work (otherwise, as I said, the combat system doesn't really work to have multiple PCs fight one monster). But also some broader things, like high deadliness at low levels translating somewhat seamlessly to more of a heroic feel at higher levels (though the game can still turn entirely deadly easily).<br/><br/>Though I should note that, even at high levels, hordes of low-level monsters will still be genuinely dangerous, except to PCs who've truly gone to absurd lengths to min-max their Armor Class. This is a design feature, though, not a flaw: since, as I said, even boss monsters usually want to have some minions, it's pretty easy to throw a Giant plus 10 kobolds at a high-level party and have that work the way it "should."<br/><br/>I should mention that my math above was wrong. No one but the Assassin auto-crits on a hit, even on a surprised opponent. (The only other way to get an auto-crit is on someone who is already down and bleeding out, which is just mean.) So halve my numbers above. Only the Assassin assassinates. Sorry for the error!<br/><br/>The *chance* of scoring a crit is about double (9.75% versus 5%) for anyone attacking from surprise, however. (Higher for Champion Fighters: 19% versus 10%.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474007/#Comment_474007" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T07:39:27+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  7:39AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>A fighter gets a bonus damage or 'deed' die (ranging from d3 to d8) which may be used for special attacks. These have to be announced before the attack roll and typically have difficulties from 2 (knock prone) to 6 (decapitate). If the deed die fails, the entire attack fails. <b>It's a neat little sub-system which also doubles as a reasonable damage bonus for fighters</b>.</p></div></blockquote>\nA small correction (if I may): The difficulty on the deed die is always 3, but higher rolls are better. And if the deed die fails, the attack roll simply happens as normal. This is what encourages the Warrior's player to throw in something extra every time \u2013 there's no penalty for trying something that's "too cool", which is a common complaint against stunt systems like those pioneered in Feng Shui.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474009/#Comment_474009" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T08:52:26+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  8:52AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As noted above, I use a modified version of DCC's "Mighty Deed of Arms" mechanic.

Once characters have around 3 or 4 hit dice, they pretty much can't be one-shotted unless its something really particular like a backstab, fireball, or an attack from a character that is insanely higher level than them.<br/><br/>This is a quirk of the hit points mechanic. Its basically plot armor and characters with a lot of it pretty much can't be taken out unless its through a prolonged and dragged out conflict scene.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474034/#Comment_474034" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T20:43:00+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  8:43PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, absolutely.

A 5th level Warlock will do 2d10+3 or +4. A 5th level Fighter, Ranger, or Barbarian, wth their extra attacks, will do anywhere from 2d8+4 to 4d6+8 (depending on Str / Dex and weapon type). A 5th level Paladin, meanwhile, if willing to blow a Smite, could do quite a bit of damage in a single hit.<br/><br/>If attacking from surprise, all attacks are with Advantage, and thus quite likely to hit, particularly against an average guard or bandit.<br/><br/>But only the Assassin can truly reliably *one-shot* NPCs or monsters with substantial numbers of HP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474041/#Comment_474041" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-18T04:25:20+00:00" title="May 18, 2018  4:25AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's all true.

If you're using a magical weapon or implement, you also do extra dice of damage on crits equal to its enchantment bonus.<br/><br/>2) Minions: Unlike other versions of D&amp;D, 1-hit mooks don't only exist at the CR 1/8 to 1/2 range but at all levels of play. That "5th level guard" may go down in one attack depending on how the GM builds the encounter.<br/><br/>3) Action Points: In 4E, each PC (and some NPCs) has a small pool of currency they can use to get an extra action in; in 5E, they gave this to the Fighter only but it allows you to get two attacks in once per encounter if need be. If you get the drop on an enemy and beat their initiative, you could get up to 3 attacks in (surprise round attack + 2 attacks with your action point) before they can even respond. If its a striker like a Ranger or Rogue making these attacks, that enemy is almost guaranteed to be dead even with higher hit point totals.<br/><br/>4) Skill Challenges: Unlike other versions of D&amp;D, 4E actually has a somewhat robust conflict resolution system that doesn't involve rolling initiative and whittling down hit point totals. As a GM, this would absolutely be my go-to method when it comes to an "assassinate the NPC" scene. Combined with the coup de grace rules above, its unlikely the NPC is surviving the knife stab.<br/><br/>For what its worth, though, I actually agree with you. The fact that "4 slashing damage" means something different fictionally depending on the hit point total of defender has always bugged my sense of verismilitude as well (the well known Schroedinger's Hit Points effect). In my own home D&amp;D game I'm preparing to run, I actually am looking at doing the opposite of what 5E did with its bounded accuracy and making level-based bonuses very high but hit point scaling very, very slight (only about a +400% gain from 1st to 30th level).<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474051/#Comment_474051" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-18T17:58:19+00:00" title="May 18, 2018  5:58PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2018 5:58PM by Thanuir.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 4 being highly nonsymmetric with respect to player and nonplayer characters, how does it handle an npc trying to assassinate a pc?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474054/#Comment_474054" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-18T18:25:01+00:00" title="May 18, 2018  6:25PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Thanuir, it depends on the NPC. If its a companion character or an elite or solo, they also have action points so would be able to use the surprise round + action point strategy I mentioned in Point 3. Its actually much more dangerous for the players in 4E as they generally have less hit points than a same level enemy, but they have access to in-combat healing so this mitigates that somewhat. The rules for coup de grace also applies to the player characters as well.<br/><br/>That being said, as a GM I would probably go to the skill challenge rules for handling "an NPC assassin is trying to kill you" for a situation like that.

So, basically, the PC needs to make a bunch of skill checks to win, and if they fail 3, they lose.<br/><br/>Win and lose outcomes could be pretty varied, depending on the fiction. Win might be "your guards and precautions deal with the assassin before he gets to you" and lose might be "he's in your bedroom, we go to the combat system to see if you can fight him off", or win might be "you managed to snap awake in the last second, we go to the combat system to see if you can fight him off" and lose might be "he killed you in your sleep". That'd be a bit extreme and atypical, but could work, especially at the levels where 4E characters routinely have "when you die, you get better" abilities.<br/><br/>Depending on the setup and how it develops, I could see any of these as a part of such a skill challenge: do you know someone's coming after you (Streetwise)? Do they dare (Intimidate)? Can you surround yourself with trustworthy people (Insight)? Have you set traps (Thievery) or magic wards (Arcana)? Can you hear him creeping up on you as you sleep (Perception)? Last second roll out of the bed as he stabs (Acrobatics)!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474076/#Comment_474076" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-19T16:25:28+00:00" title="May 19, 2018  4:25PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the skill challenge would operate as straight-up conflict resolution, bypassing hit points, AC, etc?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474077/#Comment_474077" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-19T17:08:00+00:00" title="May 19, 2018  5:08PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That's very interesting!

The core of the system is the players have to make X* successful skill checks by a certain threshold. The default threshold is "before they make 3 failed skill checks", but it could also be "before a competing group of NPCs makes X successful checks" or "before Y amount of time has passed" or "as long as it takes, but something bad happens whenever someone fails a check or refuses to take action". Also, there are some skill challenges that are deliberately designed to take place over a vast swath of campaign time so a given challenge doesn't all have to be resolved in one scene.<br/><br/>Honestly, the closest analogue to skill challenges I can think of from a more recent game are the progress clocks and countdown clocks in Blades in the Dark (which were of course influenced by the countdown clocks in Apocalypse World). When I first came across them in the BitD text, my immediate response was "these are AW-ified skill challenges".<br/><br/>Now, as to my own 4E games the way I have typically done "combat skill challenges" is to leave them open ended (so the threshold is "as long as it takes") but every time a PC fails a check this simulates them "losing" the exchange and they either take damage or lose a healing surge (depending on the nature of the combat). Its actually very reminiscent of how battles are often handled in PbtA games except instead of each NPC having an individual harm track the battle as a whole has its own harm track. I also follow online advice from other 4E GMs and will allow more combat-oriented resources like action points, encounter powers, and daily powers grant bonuses to skill checks (typically +2 to +5) or give extra successes.<br/><br/>Like I said, though, the system if very flexible and you can implement any given scenario in a variety of ways. It all depends on your needs as a GM.<br/><br/>* Where X is a number that goes up --- from 4 to 12 --- depending on the complexity of the challenge. There are 5 levels of complexity and each level gives XP equal to a monster of the challenge's level. So a 4th-level complexity 2 challenge would give XP equal to two 4th level monsters split between everyone that takes part in the challenge. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As for your thoughts on scaling, my house D&amp;D is quite similar.
