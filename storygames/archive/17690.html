So many people died. So many.<br/>Chris: \u2026 yeah, I should probably look that up \u2026<br/>Orlando: I know, right?<br/>Paul and Joe: I'll find some other way to word Possession. Maybe I can avoid the term Hold altogether.<br/><br/>Also, I am worried about essentializing foreign cultures here\u2014in the whole skin, actually. I tried to talk my way out of that problem in "Playing the R\u0101k\u1e63asa\u1e25," but I think I should make it more explicit.<br/><br/>I made Dark Appetite mandatory for three reasons. Number one, pretty much all r\u0101k\u1e63asa\u1e25s of legend eat human flesh (or, according to Wikipedia, spoiled food, although I've never read about that personally). The r\u0101k\u1e63asi in <i>Journey to the West</i> doesn't do so on-camera but it's unclear whether she's actually a r\u0101k\u1e63asi or just a monster who calls herself that because it's scary, and besides that exchange is mostly just her and the Monkey King fighting. Number two, as Liam says, I don't think anyone would take the move if it weren't mandatory.<br/><br/>Number three is, to me, both most important and most potentially offensive. I am trying to represent the fact that pretty much every culture\u2014or subculture\u2014has some quality about it which is scary and upsetting to people outside it. That quality is often connected to a stereotype; and members of the culture often find themselves unwitting apologists for that quality whether they want to or not, or whether it applies to them or not. Usually the truth is somewhere in between. <i>Harold and Kumar</i> is a good example of characters who partially embody stereotypes\u2014including positive ones\u2014about their cultures for very real, very practical reasons, some of which even have to do with their culture of origin, and have to decide whether they're going to reject them for the sake of rejecting stereotype, or accept them because they actually do make sense in their lives and just commit themselves to dealing with the stereotype in spite of it.<br/><br/>I've spent a lot of my life worrying about things I do for completely non-cultural reasons which nevertheless embody a stereotype about my culture. My mom was a draconian violin teacher to me when I was a kid. I enjoy cleaning other people's rooms. I'm a pretty shameless flirt (although recent experiences with harassment in gaming subculture have made me into more of a shameful flirt, at least). My favorite example is the quote from Neal Stephenson's <i>Cryptonomicon,</i> "Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people, which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons." When I read that, I was amused\u2014I always like to have a pocket knife and some rope on me, since you never know when a grocery bag or an Amazon delivery might attack. I related the quote to my mother, who is a first-generation Filipina American, thinking it'd annoy her. Instead, she nodded and, without missing a beat, said, "Yes, that's true. I remember when we used to go to nightclubs in the Philippines when I was little and there would be boxes of guns and knives at the coat check in the front." At least a plurality of the Filipinos I know, if not more, pride themselves in carrying as many knives as humanly possible, no matter where they are going.<br/><br/>The dark side of this same stereotype is that since Virginia Tech, whenever a school shooting or something hits the news, the first thing I think\u2014and I know I'm not the only one among Asian Americans\u2014is, "Please let the shooter not be Asian. Pleeease let the shooter not be Asian." Because then it's not "some kid shot up a school," it's "some Asian kid shot up a school\u2014again," and now it's all our problem whether we want it to be or not.<br/><br/>My mother also once remarked offhand that Filipinos from the province of Ilocos eat dogs (our family is from Luzon). I said to her, "Mom, you can't just say that. It's an offensive stereotype." She looked at me with confusion and said, "What? No, it's not, it's just true. Iloca\xf1os eat dogs." I looked at her with confusion. "It's not a negative stereotype," she went on, "it's just true. They eat dogs. I'm not saying that because it's bad, I'm saying that because it's true." Me, I've never been to Ilocos, but for all I know it's true. Even if it's true, though, it's not something I would ever mention to non-Filipinos because I'm afraid of the harm that those words would do to outsiders' perception of my countrymen\u2014that it would add to the untruths about our country more than the truths, in spite of being true.<br/><br/>Point is, maybe it's selfish of me, but I want the R\u0101k\u1e63asa\u1e25 to deal with what I had to deal with as a minority kid growing up: my relationship, especially when others were watching, to stereotypes about my culture which were sometimes true.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not married to the move's mechanics as the only way to carry that trope, or that mythical antecedent, out. Kit mentioned that the move might seem less punishing if it were more interesting or beneficial, so if anyone has other ideas, like Liam's suggestion of other villainy options, I really want to hear them! For one thing, I was thinking of changing one of the "Take a move from another Skin" advances to "Replace Dark Appetite with a move from another Skin." I think it makes sense in the mythology with r\u0101k\u1e63asa\u1e25s like Gha\u1e6d\u014dtkaca operating on the good guys' side, and also with the skin's theme of the lure of the melting pot. Would that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401329/#Comment_401329" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T11:26:38+00:00" title="December 20, 2012 11:26AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2012 11:26AM by Lula.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>Even if it's true, though, it's not something I would ever mention to non-Filipinos</i></blockquote>\n\u2026 shit                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401335/#Comment_401335" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T11:42:37+00:00" title="December 20, 2012 11:42AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, to make Dark Appetite slightly less negative, I added, "Add 2 to your next roll versus anyone whose flesh you have tasted."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401343/#Comment_401343" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T13:13:58+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  1:13PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2012 1:15PM by Lula.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, summary of recent patches to this Skin, lemme know if you like 'em:<br/>\u2022 Miscellaneous textual edits to get it down to three pages on gdocs; tell me if there are any words you miss.<br/>\u2022 Cut "read too much" from the origins list, I don't even know what that meant.<br/>\u2022 Dark Appetite now adds 2 to your next roll against anyone whose flesh you've tasted.<br/>\u2022 Removed String bonus for using Forever Alone in Darkest Self\u2014too much disincentive for your target.<br/>\u2022 Reworded Possession completely to remove the term "hold."<br/>\u2022 Changed one "Take a move from another Skin" advance to "Replace Dark Appetite with a move from another Skin."<br/>\u2022 Revised "Playing the R\u0101k\u1e63asa\u1e25," including a more direct description of what a r\u0101k\u1e63asa\u1e25 is in the source material as per Andy's suggestion on G+.<br/>\u2022 Foreign Exchange: I'm worried that forcing your appearance on someone with <i>Foreign Exchange</i> is too powerful or too disruptive.

So, after reading your explanation of the skin, here's probably how I would do Dark Appetite, and my suggestion for you, if you like it:<br/>You consume filth in order to live. Take the condition <i>sickened</i> whenever you consume normal food; heal 1-harm (max once per day) when you sate your appetite properly. Take +2forward against someone when you consume their filth. The first time someone sees you consume filth, even if they\u2019re hiding, you just know\u2014you each get a String on one another. And then having sex counts as both consuming filth and eating normal food.<br/><br/>(Upside: Players can bring their own baggage to the character by defining "filth," and then you can suggest flesh+moldies by describing the Rakshasah legend in the text. Downside: "Is this the poopeater skin?")<br/><br/>Also, I too think getting rid of (/avoiding) Dark Appetite (whichever wording) is weak sauce. If the skin's about cultural barriers, make the player deal with cultural barriers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401349/#Comment_401349" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T15:03:02+00:00" title="December 20, 2012  3:03PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that the examples for Can't Take You Anywhere make the concept of a sacred place or event quite broad.

Just for clarity.<br/><br/>Forever Alone needs to be more tied to specific actions. The trigger is not specified. You DO something pious, scholarly, or compassionate. You actively seek praise/recognition/thanks. Someone denies you what you seek. The move is triggered. The trigger needs to be more specific.
