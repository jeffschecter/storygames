Oh, and to bitch about the indie community. :-)<br/><br/>Anyway, if I had to summarize, it would be:<br/><br/>Play games with other GMs. Watch the things they do that make you more interested in the game, your character, or just the act of gaming. Copy those things, and do them yourself.<br/><br/>My GMing went from "pretty good" to "really awesome" in around 2002 or so? That was when I sat in two really awesome, fun sessions that Rafael Chandler ran. It was a game I never played before. I totally got into the game, the play, the excitement due to tricks and feedback from the GM. I immediately incorporated those tricks and tips into my GMing, and improved dramatically as a result. <br/><br/>Also interesting: Mark Causey picked up tips and tricks from me (many of the same techniques I picked up from Raf and others), and went on to run awesome sessions. As he did so, he developed new techniques, either totally new or based on those other techniques. I had played in a few of Mark's sessions later, and learned new tips/tricks/skills from him, based on stuff he learned from me, and so on.<br/><br/>It's kinda weird, but hey: I'm a visual and tactile-kinesthetic learner. I'm not an audial (book) learner. So for me, reading tips and tricks is only a little useful, seeing them with my eyes and incorporating them into my "routine" is huge in my world.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273777/#Comment_273777" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T07:07:32+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  7:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the fact that there are a bunch of games out there that effectively show you how to be a good GM.<br/><br/>Try playing games like Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, Lady Blackbird, The Shadow of Yesterday, and Primetime Adventures, and apply the lessons they teach you to any game you run.<br/><br/>For instance, Dogs teaches you how much fun it can be to do things like "reveal your [backstory] in play", the whole Say Yes or Roll the Dice thing (useful in many many contexts), preparing all your NPCs to want/need something from the PCs, make your NPCs escalate beyond what you'd consider "reasonable", etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273778/#Comment_273778" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T07:22:42+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  7:22AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play and read a lot of different games, and think about them.<br/><br/>Form mentoring and partnering relationships with other GMs and learn from them.<br/><br/>Create a local Gamemaster's Conference.<br/><br/>Read a ton of fiction.

Just doesn't happen.  Roleplaying is so contingent on a variety of factors, including the behavior and expectations of the other people at the table, that you can't make it awesome all by yourself, even if you are super talented and experienced.<br><br>The real question, I think, is how to use the social authority legitimately or illegitimately entrusted to you, as GM, to make the entire table or the entire game more awesome than it otherwise would have been.  And most of the advice given here gets at some of that.<br/><br/>My current <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> suggestion would be: realize that different games ask GMs and players to do really different things, and many of them don't even clearly state what those different things are.  You can't merely get by on your previous experience and talent at improvising, especially if you want the game to be really awesome instead of just enjoyable.  What you need is <b>fluency</b> both with the game you are playing and in interactions with the other players at the table.  <br/><br/>Fluency with game mechanics and pacing and such comes from reading, playing, and talking about the game, watching other people run it, running it extensively yourself, hacking it and seeing how that changes the results (for better and worse), playing a bunch of games that inspired this game or later games that were inspired by it, and that kind of thing.  Fluency with the players at the table comes from playing games with them a lot and talking about those games, but also from hanging out with them, living or sleeping with them (in some cases), going to the movies with them, arguing about game theory with them on the internet for 8 years, sharing the same background in games played, etc.<br/><br/>If you don't have that fluency with either the game or the players, awesome sometimes still happens, despite that.  Sometimes everything just comes together, either with mechanics that really click, or people who you really engage with or fiction that turns out feeling "just right."  And sometimes playing with people or mechanics that are new and unfamiliar is necessary to push your group into playing more actively and attentively, instead of relying on their shared familiarity and having a fun but easy time of it.  Still, in my experience, you can't really beat fluency with mechanics (in their broadest sense, "what the game desires and requires you to do") and your fellow players in creating the most solid foundation for awesome.<br/><br/>If you can't or aren't willing to invest in that fluency and intimacy, then you have to try to get as close as possible to it in the brief amount of time you have before and during the setup and play of the game.  You have to really try to connect with other players and build connections between them as quickly and as deeply as you can, without being a creepy fuck.  You have to be able to convey to the players what the game is asking them to do, both on a macro and micro level, which means the text either has to help you do that ("Do XYZ under circumstances ABC") or you have to do all the work yourself, expressing to the other players your internal understanding of how the game works.<br/><br/>You're not going to do this every time -- just last week I was having trouble connecting with the other players at the table, for weird personal reasons -- but I do think you can get better at it.  However, it's something you have to be aware of and actually have the energy to engage directly, especially if it's being a problem or there are obstacles towards achieving fluency.  It doesn't always take hard work, in the sense of it not being enjoyable, but it does take <b>sincerity</b>, I think.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273803/#Comment_273803" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T10:05:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 10:05AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with:<br/><br/>*play lots of different kinds of games<br/>*run lots of different kinds of games<br/>*play with different groups and playstyles<br/>*absorb fiction and regurgitate the best parts<br/>*play with people you like<br/><br/>and i would add my own version of what Jon's talking about with fluency, which is to recognize that you will GM some games better than others. For me, the first time I sit down to run a new game, I can usually tell within a session how much it "fits" with me - and the more it fits, the better time I have running it, and (I think) the better the actual game sessions for everybody. This is totally a hippy vibe-feeling thing, at least for me.

If you are tempted to say "Yeah of course, but give me something more specific and useful" then you need to re-read it over and over until it really sinks in. <br/><br/>Being a good player (GM or otherwise) is about connecting with people, understanding what engages them in the fiction and working to make sure they get it. (Generally they will reciprocate.) <br/><br/>It's also about understanding the systems, which only comes through experience. Games have emergent properties that you will not see or predict when you read the rules, you have to see the system in motion to figure out what it's patterns of behavior are. It's hard to move the game in a direction that will provide optimal fun if you don't understand how it works.<br/><br/>So the best advice is to seek out every play opportunity you can and, when you are in the game, be as fully aware of others as you can be. Try to do things that engage them more in the game and openly respond to things that engage you more in the game. (Say "I like that, that's awesome!" when people add stuff to the game you like. Try to get this response from others too. Watch their non-verbal cues.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273833/#Comment_273833" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T12:52:33+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 12:52PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2010 12:54PM by Ogremarco.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do not be afraid to:<br/>\nask for feedback<br/>\ntry new things<br/>\nsteal from other people's good ideas<br/>\nbacktrack<br/>\nask what people want<br/>\nlisen to podcasts and read articles<br/>\nread gamebooks cover to cover<br/>\nlearn new systems<br/>\nmaster the ones you really like<br/>\njoin in any discussion here and ask for clarification<br/>\ngo to cons and events and try things you've never heard of<br/>\nhave real discussions about difficult behavior<br/>\nhave real discussions about difficult content<br/>\npractice, practice, practice                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273834/#Comment_273834" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T12:57:27+00:00" title="June  1, 2010 12:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really enjoying all of the "higher level" advice about connecting with players and stuff, but I don't think I have much to contribute there, so I will retreat back to tangible stuff you can read! <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com" rel="nofollow">Ars Ludi</a>, the gaming theory blog by Ben Robbins has a lot of very interesting and very practical advice on running games (mostly more traditional games, but it was his recommendation to check out some indie games that got me into that whole thing).

I mean, it depends on the game you're playing and the level of required commitment.  Take two fantasy games, for example - 1E AD&amp;D requires 90% DM commitment and about 10% player.  You can have players who don't have any real story ideas or any in-depth knowledge of the rules and a good DM and everything is fine.  Burning Wheel, on the other hand, needs everyone to be invested in characterization and mechanical understanding to really run smoothly.<br><br>Short answer - it depends.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273859/#Comment_273859" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T14:46:50+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  2:46PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rely on a simple two part method:<br><br/>1.

Other GMs merely need to provide adversity for the characters, with group-facilitation being the shared province of all participants equally.

I guess that kinda ties back to adversity.<br/><br/> I think a lot of the "divorce your ego" discussion ties back to the GM being just another player.  He's not over the players and often not in an entirely different role than the players.  He's hopefully there to enjoy himself just as much as everyone else.<br/><br/> I'm going to be gone for a week, so I won't be able to reply to anything, but if you want to give more advice it'll be waiting for me when I get home.

The technique that make you a awesome "My life with master" GM is useless when you play DitV and make you an asshole GM if you are playing The Nighttime Animals Save the World.<br/><br/>In DitV, "say yes or roll the dice". In Sorcerer, "when there is a conflict, ALWAYS roll the dice".  In a lot of games, as a GM, you don't even touch the dice...<br/><br/>In Primetime Adventures, you have to prep "bangs" centered about the issues of the characters.

It would certainly be helpful to talk about some situations at the table where a technique might be more or less helpful, but it sounds like you are giving way too much credit to the game. Are there really no GM techniques that are useful for a large variety of games? Roleplaying games do have some common characteristics, after all, many of which are being obliquely referenced already in the thread. But if for example it is always important to 'care for the people you are playing with' or 'develop fluency with the game you are playing,' surely we can imagine some specific ways to do that more effectively?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>There is no such thing as "the best way to be a GM in every game",</blockquote>\nOf course there isn't, but that doesn't mean you won't be a better GM if you have a specific repertoire of actual techniques, instead of a long list of good intentions.

More clearly: nothing I said in my (one line) post had anything to do with any claim about there being specific techniques that are perfect for all games. Nothing at all. So I am trying very hard to assume you are addressing some other undercurrent in this thread... but I am struggling here. As far as I can tell nobody in the entire thread has made the claim you are opposing. I do not understand how my half-assed complaint about the thread being too general transformed into a claim that there must be One Way to GM Every Single Game Ever.<br/><br/>Less generously, you seem to be arguing that since complete universality is impossible, being specific is inappropriate to the thread. As mentioned before, I disagree with this.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Yes, there are some general things. Listen to your players, for example.</blockquote>\nOkay so, what is a tip or trick or technique that helps you listen to your players?<br/><br/>Like, here's an example I just made up: 'I make a point of checking in with my players at the end of every session to see how things are going -- I have a standard set of questions I ask, and then I have them rate how awesome it was on a scale of 1 to 7!'<br/><br/>Does this make sense at all? That's more specific. It's a specific technique to support a general intention (listen to my players). Is there a game where it would be inappropriate? Well sure, I guess, probably... but I don't actually care about that. I just want to see some specific techniques! I can use my own brain to see which games and which situations they might apply to, right?<br/><br/>I mean really, I (obviously) didn't think I needed to go in-depth on this one. Andy's post boggled the mind: "so yeah my GMing got twice as good once I learned some stuff from this guy... <i>but I am not actually going to describe any of the stuff</i>." I mean, I am not picking on Andy, and he did at least claim that he personally found descriptions less useful than seeing them in practice. I am just explaining (tediously) the basis for my single-line throwaway complaint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273990/#Comment_273990" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T06:48:18+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  6:48AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>But if for example it is always important to 'care for the people you are playing with' or 'develop fluency with the game you are playing,' surely we can imagine some specific ways to do that more effectively?</blockquote>\nFor the first: get to know your group as a group of people, not a group of roleplayers. See them outside of the game. Go to the bar, go to movies, whatever. Even if you're meeting people via a forum or meetup group or something, try to have a meal together and every so often propose non-game group activities. Be willing to have your game night turn into the occasional hang-out-and-bitch session. <br/><br/>For the second: read the book, visit the forums, ask questions about stuff that's unclear before you play the game. During the game, take notes on stuff that are hitching you up, b/c you'll forget if you try to do it afterwards. Read the book again looking for answers before going to the forums, or the designer - sometimes, things that you thought were minor on your first reading are actually pretty important, and you'll see them easier the next time around. Run it a lot. Notice how different parts of it work better for different groups or different play agendas. Once you've noticed subtleties and differences, mindfully select what to emphasize in your games that you think makes for the best game for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273993/#Comment_273993" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T07:22:45+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  7:22AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kinda disagree with "lose the ego", you're a performer, after all.

Let your actual GMing determine how you feel about yourself <i>as a GM</i> and who knows whether you'll get better or worse.

Thinking you're awesome helps that, it just needs to come with a dose of courtesy so your awesome doesn't curtail others' awesome.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to Noah's requests:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noahtrammell</cite>I'd say that a good GM <i>gets</i> a game, understands what it's about, and communicates that to the players.</blockquote>If the game designer's done their job well, this should be easy, right?  Alas, I'm sure we've all experienced far too many examples to the contrary in our RPG histories!  Here's a few topics that I find useful to cover when introducing a new game:<br/><br/>- Color (the trappings &amp; style of the fictional material)<br/>- Reward ("the more you [do the main activity of play], the more [the main outcome of play] happens")<br/>- Fictional form of the product of play (dramatic short story? virtual reality simulation? cartoon?)<br/>- Shared fictional references ("Despite the vampiric color, this is basically an X-Men kind of adventuring experience.")<br/>- Level of challenge ("You do/do not need to be clever here to avoid losing the game.")<br/>- Criteria for deciding what happens in the fiction (realism? genre emulation? whatever's most exciting?)<br/>- Character death (really might happen? fun to pretend it might happen? won't happen?)<br/><br/>Some of these I'll tell the players "this is how it is", and others, we'll discuss and negotiate.\n<blockquote>Let's see...he makes sure everyone speaks up,</blockquote>I'm going to assume that's covered by the combo of (a) giving each player something fun to interact with in the fiction, and (b) social courtesies of playing well with others.\n<blockquote>and also, he creates awesome things not with an eye of impressing players but with a view toward pushing them to also do awesome stuff.</blockquote>So, the GM needs to know what will get strong reactions from the players, right?  To this end, I recommend being clear on both (a) the general point of interest for this game (see "Reward" above) and (b) specific points of interest for each player.  <br/><br/>Some games make (b) explicit, by labeling goals, beliefs, relationships etc. on each character sheet, or by making players bid money or points to indicate what they care about during play.  In other games, it's not explicit at all; in those cases, you need to discuss before play, and hash out what each player is psyched about doing in the game.<br/><br/>If your group enjoys taking turns and watching each other's characters' scenes, then highly personal and specific quests work well.  If your group wants all the characters to stay together so everyone can keep playing, then you may need to agree on more general starting goals.<br/><br/>Once you know what everyone wants, and have wrangled those desires into being compatible with each other and the overall game, then you're ready to generate content that everyone enjoys.  If you come up with something you think is awesome, working in this context, chances are good that the players will think it's awesome too!<br/><br/>As for the actual process of generating content, some games lay out specific procedures for this, and others don't.  Without guidance, it comes down to a matter of how you like to work -- writing or drawing, focusing on people or places, preparing or ad-lib, etc.  I'm sure if you state your preferences, we could give you more suggestions.\n<blockquote>He's not over the players and often not in an entirely different role than the players.  He's hopefully there to enjoy himself just as much as everyone else.</blockquote>I think that falls out from what I suggested above, about giving thhe players the stuff they care about and otherwise doing whatever you think is fun and cool.  Choice of game also makes a big difference here, as some games' GM roles simply aren't fun for some people.<br/><br/>Hope that was helpful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274096/#Comment_274096" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-02T13:07:40+00:00" title="June  2, 2010  1:07PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>General: </b><br/>Be enthusiastic about what you're doing.

Or a situation / set-up / whatever. <br/>* Find out what parts of the game make your players excited, and let their excitement feed yours.<br/>* If something is killing your enthusiasm, talk about it with the players during the next break. Nip it in the bud.<br/>* Make a list of 3-5 items that make you excited about this game. Refer back to it. Try to touch on each one during play.<br/>* Share that list with your players. Reward them for touching on those points. Enthusiasm feedback loop!<br/><br/><b>Specific advice for "convey enthusiasm":</b><br/>* Things to avoid: mumbling, ending a lot of sentences with a falling pitch, and monotone speech. Vary the tone of your voice. <br/>* Don't hide behind a GM screen. Body language is important! <br/>* Stand up a lot! Move around! Standing and moving convey energy; energy conveys excitement.<br/>* Keep things moving from player to player. Don't let any player sit too long. This is standard pacing advice. <br/><br/><b>Specific advice for "get the players excited, too":</b><br/>* Players love hand-outs, but they don't like to read. Pictures are awesome. Props are awesome. <br/>* Unless the players are clamoring for it, the written stuff should be saved for between games, and don't tie your own enthusiasm to it.<br/>* Create setting and situation as a group. Buy-in leads to enthusiasm which leads to excitement.<br/>* At the end of each game session, ask each player, "Tell me one thing you liked and one thing you didn't like." Make them answer, no cop-outs. Revise your GMing strategy as best you can to do more of the things they like and less of the things they don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>How Do You Become an Awesome GM? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12214/how-do-you-become-an-awesome-gm/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="How Do You Become an Awesome GM? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12214/how-do-you-become-an-awesome-gm/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: JDCorleyPlay and read a lot of different games, and think about them.

That helps me remember to applaud everyone's contributions, and tell them how well they're doing and how much fun I'm having. Enthusiasm is the foundation of participatory media (talent sure as hell can't be).<br/><br/>Oh, and one other thing: Stop GMing. Play some GM-less games; they'll help you understand the arbitrariness of the collection of tasks that usually fall to the GM.

Depending on the game and the social dynamics of your group, you will have to do these things in greater or lesser proportion, but they will always be necessary at least sometimes to some extent. There are also specific techniques that are widely successful in pursuing these broad goals of good GM-craft.<br/><br/>Create enthusiasm:<br/>* I give immediate verbal reinforcement and high fives whenever I think something is awesome. Lame? Perhaps, except that after a couple of sessions all my players spontaneously started doing it (thereby transporting ourselves back to fifth grade), and suddenly we had an explicit system for encouraging the awesome (to the point that even the most ego-tastic player in my group started actually trying to work with instead of against the other players, just because he got tired of being left out of the high fives for being an asshat. Where talking to him [multiple times!] failed, high fives succeeded. Go figure.).<br/>* Prep the players before they narrate so that they don't miss any chance to be awesome. Personally, I try to make it clear that they should not hold back from being awesome: all players are excited when their character gets to do something awesome. "Nice! That was awesome! Now the villain's completely at your mercy-- what do you do to crown your moment of glory?" Enthusiastically invite players to realize their ends in a triumphant way.<br/>* Corollary to the previous: cede to the players opportunities for being awesome at every turn.<br/><br/>Listen to your players not as an end in itself, but always at the same time as a means. (From anti-Kantian ludology. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> )<br/>* When my players speak, I always immediately reincorporate their contributions. If they mention setting details, I add to them or use them ("The thug grabs the fire extinguisher off of the wall-- the one that Eric mentioned a couple of minutes ago-- and swings it at your head!"). If they adopt a certain accent, I use a complementary one (hmm... he's a dwarf with a lowland Scottish accent, so these dwarves from near his homeland will have highland accents!). If they mention goals or motivations, I make reference back to them ("... so that by overpowering the guard quickly, we can stop him from raising the alarm." *Rolls.* "As you tackle the rent-a-cop to the ground, he opens his mouth to shout for help.

You win this thread.<br/><br/>I've just recently (in the past few years) started GMing long term games. This is so much more complicated than one-offs! Here's some things I did:<br/><br/>*Kept all my notes in one place in a giant word file on my laptop. Run the game directly from this laptop, with various things in the document highlighted, notated, and in different colors. Have a PDF of the game I'm running on the laptop too. This is AWESOME because of the SEARCH option to look back over my notes in 0.00001 seconds to find a name of a place or something that happened in a previous session.<br/>*In said notes, I write notes to myself all the time. Things like "player A put worms in the ship's ducts!" This way I remember all the details! (which I'm horrible with and would forget otherwise)<br/>*I also put things at the top of my game document. Things like "Include a new alien, new technology, and at least one fight in every episode" to keep my story consistent through every session with the tone I want to keep. I put themes in this too, like "betrayal, dark and moody, pulpy".<br/>*Also notes like "focus on intrigue! what do the players want? what do the NPC's want?" These help me focus on the mechanics of running the game.<br/>*The style of GMing I've found I prefer is to approach it as a player. I consider what I want as a player "colorful settings, unique and interactive NPCs, meaningful conflicts, tough decisions, fun fights" and I let this be the things that color how I run the game because <b>I enjoy doing them</b>. Then I take what my players like "autonomy from the big plot, ability to change things meaningfully, control over their characters and some of their character's NPCs, relationships and realistic interactions, being silly not serious, winning fights awesomely" and try to do those things too. That way, we all get what we want no matter what game we're playing. I kinda GM like I make art. I like to make things that people understand and enjoy.<br/>*Constantly try to improve! If something doesn't work one session, I note it down and change it for next session. Around session 5, we get into a groove. I'm of the opinion you can never stop improving in anything. This is fun!<br/>*Keep everyone's character sheets in a folder with all other maps/aspect/story sheets/badges of honor/specshul weapons. That shit gets lost.<br/>*Come prepared! However that is for you! I tend to just write out specific scenes I have in mind, a general plot idea, some pretty descriptions of scenery and settings and objects, and NPCs that I want to focus on. The rest I improvise. That's just how I like to do it. My husband writes monologues and paragraph text. That's just how he does it.<br/>*Two of the best GM advice things I've ever read (paraphrased): "Always say yes and" and "Don't keep the story from your players! Tell them everything and then let things happen." I'm still working on both of these, because a lot of the time I say no when I should say yes but lets negotiate that, and I also sometimes still think my story is the sacred thing whose secrets will be revealed when I want them too. I say if you have story, share it, then create more.<br/><br/><br/>Hope that was some concrete stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274842/#Comment_274842" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T08:58:43+00:00" title="June  7, 2010  8:58AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite><br/>*In said notes, I write notes to myself all the time.

The players, too, can look over the notes and be inspired to reincorporate information into the story, or just to remember to do something cool in-character ("Oh, yeah, those worms!

Instead, I was describing the effects that happened from the main tip in my post, which was "<b>Learn by playing under other great GMs; watch them and use their tricks as your own.</b>"<br/><br/>Furthermore, I was stating that for visual/tactile learners like myself, reading about tips is always secondary to actually experiencing them in play, having them done to you or watching them happen to someone else. It would be... weird... to go off on how visual/tactile the transmission of these tips/tricks are, and then try to shoehorn them into words (audial learning).<br/><br/>I've done so in the past, though. "Fishing", frex. A lot of the threads I've started on this site or contributed to are my attempt to describe -in words (bleh) - stuff that I picked up by seeing and doing, not reading.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274850/#Comment_274850" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-07T10:18:09+00:00" title="June  7, 2010 10:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good advice! We're playing Spirit of the Century right now, which has the "setting aspects" page in the middle of the table that everyone can already see too. Usually everyone remembers certain details but not all of them. In our games, the details can get pretty complex, cause everyone comes up with little things all the time. So while most funny or impactful things are remembered collectively: "Hey remember when he harvested that egg from the Kalish operative and now it might contain his unborn son?!" small things like "There's worms in the ducts and trip lines in the hanger bay!" can be remembered to the rest of the group when it becomes important by the GM or the player who has invested it into the setting.<br/><br/>Still, I like your idea. Sometimes we keep track of quotes like this too, I guess its more informal than having an actual sheet. Its fun ways of making the things that the characters do in previous sessions matter in current sessions.<br/><br/>Oh! More things that we do:<br/>*What happened last time? Collectively we'll go around the table and remember what happened in the previous session together, with the GM filling in the plot details that might be important that we may have forgotten. Sometimes we do it like in a TV show intro with the GM in the lead "Last time, on Battlestar Galactica" style, doing important vignettes each character had from previous sessions that will be important in this one somehow. Its a way the GM can subtly introduce some foreshadowing. <br/>*Getting our jibblies out! We hang out for about a half hour shooting the shit before we start gaming so we get our talk and silliness (nicknamed jibblies) out and can focus on the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275086/#Comment_275086" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T02:31:50+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  2:31AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm an adequate GM.

Too often, the idea of being an awesome GM presupposes that you're Bringing The Awesome to the table.

You shouldn't push the players if they want to drive the story in a different direction, but if the situation is appropriate you shouldn't hesitate to hit them really hard.  In The Dark Knight, the Joker is threatening Batman's beliefs, friends, and the city.  Batman can save the city, salvage his beliefs, albeit only just, but he loses his love, and that's OK.  That's what drama is.<br/> Be a good villain, be a good friend, just don't go around thinking you should be a good scriptwriter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12214/how-do-you-become-an-awesome-gm" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12214/how-do-you-become-an-awesome-gm" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12214/how-do-you-become-an-awesome-gm/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12214%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12214%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
