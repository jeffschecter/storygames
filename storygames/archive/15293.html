I guess rolling dice on tables works just as well theoretically, but in practice with each card I turned over (usually in sets of three), a character/personality basically erupted in my head, far more so than when I roll on "personality tables" and the like.<br/><br/>Just chucking this out there. If you have a set of Apples to Apples (party box is a great set), give it a shot if you're trying to come up with NPCs on the fly. Any genre should work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc" title="otherdoc"><img alt="otherdoc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://otherdoc.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/jimsquared32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/otherdoc">otherdoc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347690/#Comment_347690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T19:26:44+00:00" title="November  2, 2011  7:26PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played with folks who've done the "I am..." thing, too.

We totally ignored what was actually on the green cards (or used it for inspiration if we really wanted to) and made up little stories of a few sentences, usually silly fictional autobiographical stories, stopping with a cliff hanger sentence. The red card responses were to finish the story.<br/><br/>And when it amused us to do so, we linked the mini-stories together. We ended up crafting a narrative about me going to jail for some sort of bizarre reason and having strange things happen there.<br/><br/>Made for a nice "story game variant" of the standard game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markwalt" title="markwalt"><img alt="markwalt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markwalt">markwalt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347873/#Comment_347873" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-04T13:16:32+00:00" title="November  4, 2011  1:16PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about, all players draw four green cards and assign values to them using Risus rules, and the GM draws from the red deck to create a spontaneous adventure.<br/><br/>During play, players can either narrate the use of their attributes (and roll the dice), or pick a red card and narrate how that helps them with the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
