In fact, this game seems calculated to offend them, but that's totally cool, because that's what satire does.<br/><br/>I don't think this game would offend people <i>who you don't want to offend</i>. The concept seems like a clever take on how being out can be both empowering and dangerous. It's also a cool reimagining (deconstruction and reconstruction?) of the "superheroes as stand-ins for oppressed minorities" trope that you see in comics like X-Men. <br/><br/>Assuming the mechanics were fun, this is a game I would definitely want to play.

Also, make sure you avoid simplistic binaries and essentialism - if sexual orientation is going to be central to the fictional world, account for bisexual, asexual, trans* identified people as well. I like the notion that superheroism isn't inherent in all homosexual people, it's just yet another vector of biology and identity that happens to only occur in homosexuals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378396/#Comment_378396" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T08:01:16+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  8:01AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a weird idea.

Lots to try and put into a game.<br/><br/>There's a thread through a lot of cultures concerning a prescribed social role for non-heterosexual/cisgendered folk that has a spiritual component: two-spirit, uranian, hijra, etc.  The idea of the holy man or woman transgressing gender norms (hi, Joan of Arc!).  It might be interesting, especially in a theocratic setting, to connect sexual and/or gender identity to spiritual identity to powers.  Superpowers/queerness are granted by the gods, but also a disruption of the status quo and a threat to the state.

I would myself expect the queer angle to get repressed in the status quo, so nobody would actually know that all these superpeople are gay. Who's going to suspect Superman of being a homosexual? If one decided to come out about it, they'd be dealt with as an abhorrent exception, and his lynching would encourage others to stay quiet. This would be pretty credible even if we assumed that the superheroes themselves somehow knew the truth about each other and the phenomenon, at least until they decided that enough is enough and forced the mainstream society to either bend or break in face of the truth.<br/><br/>Maybe an exceptional journalist puts two and two together after some decades of supers activity and writes an expose credible enough to be taken seriously by cross-comparing a sufficient number of known facts. Or I guess superheroes could all have rainbow special effects and their powers could be stronger when they act stereotypically gay, so that the facts simply could not be misconstrued. Or the origin of superpowers is known because the whole thing started when the Gay Space God descended upon the Earth and bestowed superpowers upon 1% of the world's homosexuals in a highly public declaration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378447/#Comment_378447" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T10:20:24+00:00" title="May 15, 2012 10:20AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about God?<br/><br/><br/><br/>People don't worry about offending him as much as they used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378455/#Comment_378455" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T10:42:00+00:00" title="May 15, 2012 10:42AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ethan K.</cite>If you're going to make this explicitly about queerness and use homophobia/hate crimes as the elements, you need to be<b>really fucking careful</b>because that material will be very charged for anyone who's encountered it before.

It may depend on the application.<br/><br/>Many of my gay friends love X-Men because they can see a bit of themselves in the protagonists. <br/><br/>I don't find this offensive.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But is it offensive? <br/><br/>It's hard for me to imagine anything that someone wouldn't find offensive. There are people who find RPGs offensive. We don't even have to go as far as tackling your specific subject matter. Is it an RPG? Someone already finds that offensive. <br/><br/>Trying to never offend anyone is a losing game. But if your goal is to not offend specific people, then ask them how they specifically feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

But they may then be offended by what people actually do with your game, which is out of your control. <br/><br/>I have friends who refuse to play the Skyrim video game. Why? Because Skyrim players made youtube videos of emergent game play that my friends found offensive. I don't believe this gameplay was intended by the creators of Skyrim. It's emergent play. <br/><br/>I love Dogs in the Vineyard but people have done things I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with it. But that's part of the point of an RPG. Players have a lot of freedom to explore, make choices, and be creative in their own safe spaces. If they then publish their gameplay and I find it offensive, I'm generally going to try not to blame the game creator. <br/><br/>But some people will blame the creator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378516/#Comment_378516" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T14:26:16+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  2:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2012 2:36PM by RobMcDiarmid.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what you get out of setting it in a theocracy that you don't get even more out of setting it in a straight up "this is the only thing that's different about the world" setting. I assume that the theocracy idea is intended to bring the anti-gay possibilities into stark relief and higher contrast. But I think that by making that part of the setting less normal, you lose some of the subtlety and impact that could be present if the game was just set "right here, right now, plus supers (who are gay)".<br/><br/>I think having a more "here and now" setting gives you more interesting and subtle possiblities.<br/><br/>You have the possibility of people who are jealous that some of the population has superpowers and they don't. And they used to be gay friendly. But now all these people have these awesome advantages that they're jealous of. Presumably some of those people would start associating all gays with the ones they're jealous of. There's some extremely fruitful ground, there. And I think that type of character would be de-emphasized by the theocracy idea.<br/><br/>Also, I really love how this concept ties the ideas of a superhero secret identity and the gay closet together in really interesting ways.<br/><br/>Presumably you'd have some of the gay superheroes who would be in, for example, marriages of convenience as part of how they protect their secret identity. Which leads to some interesting potential for thinking about how that sort of thing is an everyday reality for some members of real society. There's some good stuff there.<br/><br/>And there could be variants. Like the Will &amp; Grace setup - the straight girl who likes her gay friend as more than a friend, etc, etc. Not that you'd want to emphasize sitcom hijinks. But the premise of the game invites some interesting character thoughts that otherwise would be less likely to be thought about by some players.<br/><br/>Ooooohh!! You should strongly consider taking a Smallville type approach to making the non-supers characters just as interesting and important to the story as the supers. This would be the kind of setting where having the players be less than half supers characters would potentially be tons better than playing a supers team. Maybe mandate that there be specifically exactly one supers character per group. There might be a lot of fruitful (Just realized I'm using that word a lot in a post related to gay interests. I'm 95% sure that's just a weird coincidence.) ground in that limitation.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say the key would be to approach it similarly to how you'd approach issues of potential cultural appropriation. Do your research. A lot of it. Make it super apparent in your writing that you've put your time in to approach the subject with respect.<br/><br/>After that, some of the people who play it will be assholes. You can't fix that. But you can do your part right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378524/#Comment_378524" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T15:15:21+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  3:15PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WOW.

It seems reasonable to me that, if this situation actually occurred, that's one of the many things that would happen.<br/><br/>But it's far from the only thing that would happen. Reading generously, I'm assuming that Joseph listed off just a few of the first implications that occurred to him as he was spitballing an initial idea.<br/><br/>And yeah, in order to address the idea effectively, you'd need to do a lot more than just spitball. You'd need to put your time in and think things through and present a well considered concept.<br/><br/>Figuring out how to work in bisexuals, transgenders, hermaphrodites and anything else in the muddier middle ground would be a fascinating exercise.<br/><br/>And I'm wondering what the pseudoscience trigger is assumed to be. A genetic marker that's associated with genetic predisposition to homosexuality? Presumably you'd need to get up to date on whatever the current state of science is regarding linkage/causation/etc. as part of doing the subject justice. Even if you don't go into exacting detail on the pseudoscience supers explanation, you still want to write your assumptions in a way that fits.<br/><br/>As Sage said, the linkages of biology and sexuality are murky and gray, and this setting assumes something pretty cut and dried.<br/><br/>That being said, the fact that only some gays get powers helps the setting deal with the gray area a bit more effectively.<br/><br/>What would you do with the notion that women identify as bisexual much more commonly than men? Particularly with the "playfully bisexual" or, shall we say, the "bi when she's drunk" or "I used to get it on with girls back in college" notion. There might be some interesting ground there.<br/><br/>And you'd get an interesting possibility that someone who didn't currently identify as gay, but was a teenager dealing with confusing feelings, manifested superpowers. Dealing with what that means could be some interesting stuff in play.<br/><br/>Like I said before, I think it might be especially interesting to mandate that the game only have one super, like a Smallville or Buffy type setup. That way the supers content would be more of a thematic element rather than a drive to have lots of games about beating people up all the time, which would be the least interesting thing you could do with the setting concept, in my opinion.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a teen coming-of-age story set in a backdrop of a world where there are these people who dress up in costumes and spend their evenings looking for criminals to beat up, and those people are all queer, and Johnny, who thinks he might be queer too but isn't sure, has started exhibiting weird powers and still has to deal with his friends, including, of course, the girl who has a crush on him.

I assume that the theocracy idea is intended to bring the anti-gay possibilities into stark relief and higher contrast. But I think that by making that part of the setting less normal, you lose some of the subtlety and impact that could be present if the game was just set "right here, right now, plus supers (who are gay)".<br/><br/>I think having a more "here and now" setting gives you more interesting and subtle possiblities.<br/><br/>You have the possibility of people who are jealous that some of the population has superpowers and they don't. And they used to be gay friendly. But now all these people have these awesome advantages that they're jealous of. Presumably some of those people would start associating all gays with the ones they're jealous of. There's some extremely fruitful ground, there. And I think that type of character would be de-emphasized by the theocracy idea.<br/><br/>Also, I really love how this concept ties the ideas of a superhero secret identity and the gay closet together in really interesting ways.<br/><br/>Presumably you'd have some of the gay superheroes who would be in, for example, marriages of convenience as part of how they protect their secret identity. Which leads to some interesting potential for thinking about how that sort of thing is an everyday reality for some members of real society. There's some good stuff there.<br/><br/>And there could be variants. Like the Will &amp; Grace setup - the straight girl who likes her gay friend as more than a friend, etc, etc. Not that you'd want to emphasize sitcom hijinks. But the premise of the game invites some interesting character thoughts that otherwise would be less likely to be thought about by some players.<br/><br/>Ooooohh!! You should strongly consider taking a Smallville type approach to making the non-supers characters just as interesting and important to the story as the supers. This would be the kind of setting where having the players be less than half supers characters would potentially be tons better than playing a supers team. Maybe mandate that there be specifically exactly one supers character per group. There might be a lot of fruitful (Just realized I'm using that word a lot in a post related to gay interests. I'm 95% sure that's just a weird coincidence.) ground in that limitation.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say the key would be to approach it similarly to how you'd approach issues of potential cultural appropriation. Do your research. A lot of it. Make it super apparent in your writing that you've put your time in to approach the subject with respect.<br/><br/>After that, some of the people who play it will be assholes. You can't fix that. But you can do your part right.</blockquote>\nI hate doing large wall-of-text quotes, but pretty much all of this is pure gold.<br/><br/>And I can't help but hear the TV Funhouse jingle in my head.

Are you implying the dominant religion is homophobic? Then criminalization of super-heroism is pretty likely\u2026<br/><br/>One thing which worries me (not "offend", but "worry" like "I don't know how I could actually manage this in play"):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>Anyone with superpowers also <b>happens to be</b> homosexual.</blockquote>\nThis seems to require sexual orientation, in this game, to be something which "just happens you", with little control on your part. That is, a <i>condition</i>, not a choice. In fact, you use the verb "to be" homosexual.<br/>And this is, to me, the problematic part: treating "homosexuality" as simple character <i>trait</i>, rather than a choice of behavior which impacts a character's relationships or (which would be my own take on the issue) a mere recap of the state of a character's past and current relationships and episodes of attraction. It would make me hard-pressed to play a character to simply have the "homosexual attribute" handed me like a D&amp;D alignment. What happens, then, if a character develops a romantic attraction for a person of a different gender? Are they still considered to "be" a homosexual or not? Do they lose their superpowers?<br/>Thus, while I understand that this game would attempt to short-circuit the logics of homophobia through this powerful metaphor of the "othering" of homosexuals, in practice it risks encoding the "othering" in its system in such a way that it becomes a necessity to further it in order to keep playing: it requires homosexuality to be (mistakenly) understood as a "status" or "inherent personality attribute" because it's also a yes/no condition for the possession of quantifiable in-game superpowers. This can get out of hand very fast.<br/><br/>I can think of two ways to "patch" the concept so that it would work for me in play:\n<ul><li>Superpowers as magic, rather than a mere "physical" fact. This means <i>intentionality</i> is important, as well as ritualistic behavior and meaning \u2014 making it easier to correlate such powers with real-world homosexuality than it would be for Superman-like powers. Maybe feeling same-gender attraction is a prerequisite for developing powers in the first place, or maybe involving oneself in same-gender relationships is part of the necessary ritualistic regime for <i>maintaining</i> powers. This makes the metaphor a better fit, in that it can more comfortably be stretched to accommodate various real-life cases.</li>\n<li>Instead of "being homosexual", anybody with superpowers is somehow genderqueer \u2014 including <i>any</i> deviation from the mainstream cisgenderheterosexual paradigm: people who identify as homosexual, people who don't fit in their assigned gender, people who see themselves as asexual, etc. Maybe what superpowers come bundled with is, actually, just a heightened perception of how artificial and fucked-up the assumed social norm is, which makes them more conscious of/responsive to their own individual way(s) of defying it. This actually changes the metaphor to a broader one which I think is less at risk of breaking under rough handling.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378567/#Comment_378567" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T19:11:39+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  7:11PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafaele, that's awesome!<br/><br/>What if superpowers don't cause queer identity, but rather, queer behaviour causes superpowers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378628/#Comment_378628" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T08:27:21+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  8:27AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2012 8:27AM by anansigirl.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

There's way too much ripe conflict being thrown away if this is the case. It would feel like I'm not honestly engaging the core of the subject.\n<blockquote>Maybe you should pop the question on a christian/biblical/whatever forum too?</blockquote>\nNah, I'm not particularly concerned with offending people who can genuinely be offended by consenting adults having sexual relations with other consenting adults. Having been variously Christian, LDS, agnostic, and finally atheist over the course of 28 years, I think  I can speak from a Christian point of view with a fair bit of authority. Certainly, if someone of that nature ends up offended, I'd address it, but that wouldn't necessarily mean changing the game in any way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whduryea</cite>The concept seems like a clever take on how being out can be both empowering and dangerous. It's also a cool reimagining (deconstruction and reconstruction?) of the "superheroes as stand-ins for oppressed minorities" trope that you see in comics like X-Men.</blockquote>\nYes, that's pretty much exactly what I'm going for! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Assuming the mechanics were fun, this is a game I would definitely want to play. I hope you move forward with it.</blockquote>\nGreat to hear it. I have NO idea what mechanics I might decide on. I may just use an AW hack as a stand in for now, as I'm not very familiar with Cortex (though perhaps I should GET familiar with it?).<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>It definitely makes gay people "the other," which is kind of uncomfortable.</blockquote>\nWell, I-\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Hm, yes.

There's another setting goal I'd like to tackle. Thanks!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ethan K.</cite>Because if you're going to potentially trigger people with hate crimes (and yeah, you really need to watch out for this), you better allow us to enact vengeance.</blockquote>\nBloody motherfucking vengeance! And also, the kind where you just beat them up a little and leave them webbed to a street lamp for the police to collect. Y'know, your choice.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Can I have weak super powers and be only a little bit gay?</blockquote>\nTell you what, you can choose between the ability to turn things plaid and the ability to spontaneously generate three cubic inches of mashed potatoes.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>: I'm still working on figuring out exactly why it is known to everyone that only queer individuals end up with superpowers, though I'm not sure if I want the nature of superpowers to be behavioral, genetic or what in nature. Probably psychological. It's the <i>desire</i> to be  that brings about powers. This seems ripe for political scandals involving "All-American Family Man" types developing powers, and their wives tearfully leaving them, and taking the kids with.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>What about God? People don't worry about offending him as much as they used to.</blockquote>\nYeah, I worry about offending God as much as I worry about offending, say, the Tooth Fairy, Poseidon, or Albus Dumbledore. Since they exist an equal amount. (Come to think of it, I probably worry more about Poseidon than the others, because the ocean is fucking HUGE and scary.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Are you "the other" when you are a protagonist? It may depend on the application.</blockquote>\nI smell another goal!\n<blockquote>Many of my gay friends love X-Men because they can see a bit of themselves in the protagonists.</blockquote>\nTotally. I had the Mutant Registration Act, etc. in mind when coming up with this. I feel like there are a lot of parallels between that and, say, discriminatory laws like DOMA and Don't Ask, Don't Tell, which could be interestingly interwoven. [JOKE]Plus, I could totally see myself in Shadowcat.

But if your goal is to not offend specific people, then ask them how they specifically feel.</blockquote>\nDefinitely food for thought. I am certainly more interested in the opinions of non-heterosexuals here, but had/have no intention of asking anyone to out themselves if they are not 100,000% comfortable in doing so. Still, I'm definitely am loving all the interest and idea-bouncing going on! Y'all are great!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>Yea, I mean, I can see it being offensive in the same way Boys Don't Cry is offensive. Bigotry and hate crimes are offensive. Telling stories about them is important. Are you worried about it offending people, or are you trying to offend people to make a point, right?</blockquote>\nThis! I suppose I'm going more for making people uncomfortable to make a point than I am going for actually offending.\n<blockquote>Actually, also what John said about the X-men. That's rife with social commentary, but in metaphor. Yours just comes out and says it.

The one gay friend I have access to at the moment (I am working very far out of state right now) is a lesbian co-worker. I pitched her the basic gist from the OP this morning (minus the theocracy, which I'll get to in a minute), and she said she thinks that's a really good idea.

But some people will blame the creator.</blockquote>\nSure, but I'm kinda like, "...fuck 'em." As far as I am concerned, most groups are going to do stuff they are comfortable with as a group, and if someone else finds their AP offensive, that's their AP. It's not like I'd go around associating myself with a bigot's AP by linking it or anything. But if someone were to actually introduce awfulness that offends someone who is currently at the table playing with them, then it's that person who is a dick, not me. Not that I am not necessarily a dick, per se. But it wouldn't be my problem, as such. It'd be an issue of someone else disrespecting someone else, and the offended party could as likely thank me for providing the offending party an outlet to show their true colors and thus give the offended party the go ahead to boot them from the group or switch groups, at their preference. *shrug*\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>I'm not sure what you get out of setting it in a theocracy that you don't get even more out of setting it in a straight up "this is the only thing that's different about the world" setting.</blockquote>\nYup, you caught me. That was a throwaway line at the last second. I guess I put it in there to give myself an out if I wanted to make it so that people didn't have to deal with those kind of identity issues in the "real" world, but there really isn't a need for a theocracy, as such. I mean, for most intents and purposes, we live in a theocracy in the USA. There isn't any reason, beyond religious preferences, to prevent two consenting adults from marrying. Not to mention that said prevention is thereby illegal under the 1st and 14th amendments to the highest form of law in the land. So I guess it's more of a hypocrisy than a theocracy. But at least they rhyme, right? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>You have the possibility of people who are jealous that some of the population has superpowers and they don't. And they used to be gay friendly. But now all these people have these awesome advantages that they're jealous of. Presumably some of those people would start associating all gays with the ones they're jealous of. There's some extremely fruitful ground, there. <br/><br/>Also, I really love how this concept ties the ideas of a superhero secret identity and the gay closet together in really interesting ways.<br/><br/>Presumably you'd have some of the gay superheroes who would be in, for example, marriages of convenience as part of how they protect their secret identity. Which leads to some interesting potential for thinking about how that sort of thing is an everyday reality for some members of real society. There's some good stuff there.<br/><br/>And there could be variants. Like the Will &amp; Grace setup - the straight girl who likes her gay friend as more than a friend, etc, etc. Not that you'd want to emphasize sitcom hijinks. But the premise of the game invites some interesting character thoughts that otherwise would be less likely to be thought about by some players.<br/><br/>Ooooohh!! You should strongly consider taking a Smallville type approach to making the non-supers characters just as interesting and important to the story as the supers.</blockquote>\nYup, all stuff I've been mulling over myself. \n<blockquote>This would be the kind of setting where having the players be less than half supers characters would potentially be tons better than playing a supers team. Maybe mandate that there be specifically exactly one supers character per group. There might be a lot of fruitful ground in that limitation.</blockquote> I'm not sure how much I like this limitation. I'd rather make the game itself be about love and relationships in troubled times, and have the superpowers be a part of the backdrop that's a catalyst for conflict. I'm not sure what the game would be saying if I force the players to pick one of them to be gay (and superpowered) and the rest  that couldn't be said better by letting them make their own choices and dealing with the consequences.\n<blockquote>Overall, I'd say the key would be to approach it similarly to how you'd approach issues of potential cultural appropriation. Do your research. A lot of it. Make it super apparent in your writing that you've put your time in to approach the subject with respect.<br/><br/>After that, some of the people who play it will be assholes. You can't fix that. But you can do your part right.</blockquote>\nOutstanding advice. In that vein, anyone who is non- who wouldn't mind being interviewed about what it's like living in today's society as this type of "other," I'd love a whisper, please.\n<blockquote>Oh. I also like the idea that, in a setting like this, if you had to hero guys who worked together as partners, a lot of people would assume that they're "partners". And some would be. And others wouldn't. But people would assume that they were, probably more often than they would assume that every male and female partnership in a more typical supers setting are lovers.<br/><br/>There's just a lot of interesting stuff that could come out of the setting assumptions, which is neat.</blockquote>\nIndeed! And there's an angle I hadn't yet considered. Very cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Is this offensive? - Page 2 - Story

class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: adamwb</cite>the idea of "costuming it up" seems mostly to be about a certain social presentation of gay men. How do queer people who don't fit that mould (including: non-camp men as well as lesbians or other non-hetero people, transpeople, etc) fit into this world?</blockquote>\nInteresting. I'm definitely thinking I'll broaden this to include the entire LGBTQ...A? community as a whole. Also, I hadn't considered the idea of costuming as relevant only to flamboyantly gay men, but I suppose that could work as an ugly assumption that some of the majority element in the game make. Neat!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: soviet</cite>There was an actual comic like this called New Statesmen</blockquote>\nAwesome! I'll be picking this up on Amazon! FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Reading generously, I'm assuming that Joseph listed off just a few of the first implications that occurred to him as he was spitballing an initial idea.</blockquote>\nYup, that's exactly why this was posted under "little ideas." I appreciate the charitable reading.\n<blockquote>And yeah, in order to address the idea effectively, you'd need to do a lot more than just spitball. You'd need to put your time in and think things through and present a well considered concept. Figuring out how to work in bisexuals, transgenders, hermaphrodites and anything else in the muddier middle ground would be a fascinating exercise.</blockquote>\nIndeed. There is a sizable LGBT community on another gaming forum I frequent as well, so I may take this there, too.\n<blockquote>And I'm wondering what the pseudoscience trigger is assumed to be. A genetic marker that's associated with genetic predisposition to homosexuality? Presumably you'd need to get up to date on whatever the current state of science is regarding linkage/causation/etc. as part of doing the subject justice. Even if you don't go into exacting detail on the pseudoscience supers explanation, you still want to write your assumptions in a way that fits.</blockquote> Definitely going to be interesting to try and figure out. I would ideally like it to be something that is triggered particularly by nonstandard lusts. That is, lusting after same-sex partners, multiple partners, etc, but not necessarily sexual fetishes. My thoughts get kind of muddy here. I'm not sure where that leaves asexual folks, either. I mean, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of prejudice against people whom it's easy to just label as "straight, but abstinent" since they don't have sexual desires to speak of...? So I'm not sure what I would want to say, if anything, about asexuals or hermaphrodites.\n<blockquote>That being said, the fact that only some gays get powers helps the setting deal with the gray area a bit more effectively.</blockquote> Yup, that was kind of the point of that. So that's good.\n<blockquote>What would you do with the notion that women identify as bisexual much more commonly than men? Particularly with the "playfully bisexual" or, shall we say, the "bi when she's drunk" or "I used to get it on with girls back in college" notion. There might be some interesting ground there. And you'd get an interesting possibility that someone who didn't currently identify as gay, but was a teenager dealing with confusing feelings, manifested superpowers. Dealing with what that means could be some interesting stuff in play.</blockquote> I'm thinking probably a smaller percentage are supers, but definitely some are.\n<blockquote>Like I said before, I think it might be especially interesting to mandate that the game only have one super, like a Smallville or Buffy type setup. That way the supers content would be more of a thematic element rather than a drive to have lots of games about beating people up all the time, which would be the least interesting thing you could do with the setting concept, in my opinion.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a teen coming-of-age story set in a backdrop of a world where there are these people who dress up in costumes and spend their evenings looking for criminals to beat up, and those people are all queer, and Johnny, who thinks he might be queer too but isn't sure, has started exhibiting weird powers and still has to deal with his friends, including, of course, the girl who has a crush on him. There's gold in them thar hills.</blockquote>\nStill not liking the forced mandate thing, though that's definitely a game type I could suggest in the opening chapter. And TOTALLY the second one.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite> I can't help but hear the TV Funhouse jingle in my head. I will probably be hearing that in my head at work at the hospital tomorrow. That will make things interesting.</blockquote>\nSaturday TV Fun-House! T-V-Fun-House!<br/>LOL, I had completely forgotten about the Ambiguously Gay Duo when I thought this up. Seriously awesome, heh.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>One thing which worries me (not "offend", but "worry" like "I don't know how I could actually manage this in play"): <cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite>Anyone with superpowers also<b>happens to be</b>homosexual.</blockquote>\nThis seems to require sexual orientation, in this game, to be something which "just happens you", with little control on your part. That is, a<i>condition</i>, not a choice. In fact, you use the verb "to be" homosexual.<br/>And this is, to me, the problematic part: treating "homosexuality" as simple character<i>trait</i>, rather than a choice of behavior which impacts a character's relationships or (which would be my own take on the issue) a mere recap of the state of a character's past and current relationships and episodes of attraction. It would make me hard-pressed to play a character to simply have the "homosexual attribute" handed me like a D&amp;D alignment. What happens, then, if a character develops a romantic attraction for a person of a different gender? Are they still considered to "be" a homosexual or not? Do they lose their superpowers? <br/>Hm. Do you see your sexual preference as a choice? I consider myself a straight man, because to date I have only ever had sexual interest in women. There is nothing about the male form I find arousing, nor could I choose to be gay or bisexual. It seems like you are almost implying that there is some sort of choice involved. Whoo would choose to be gay in a society which largely condemns it? Oh wait, there's an interesting setting question...\n<blockquote>Thus, while I understand that this game would attempt to short-circuit the logics of homophobia through this powerful metaphor of the "othering" of homosexuals, in practice it risks encoding the "othering" in its system in such a way that it becomes a necessity to further it in order to keep playing: it requires homosexuality to be (mistakenly) understood as a "status" or "inherent personality attribute" because it's also a yes/no condition for the possession of quantifiable in-game superpowers. This can get out of hand very fast.</blockquote>\nOkay, now I think I understand you better. The issue is that in order to have the powers, the player has declare that her character is gay? Again, I'm still working on the specifics here. This is still just the nugget of an idea.\n<blockquote>I can think of two ways to "patch" the concept so that it would work for me in play:\n<ul><li>Superpowers as magic, rather than a mere "physical" fact. This means<i>intentionality</i>is important, as well as ritualistic behavior and meaning \u2014 making it easier to correlate such powers with real-world homosexuality than it would be for Superman-like powers. Maybe feeling same-gender attraction is a prerequisite for developing powers in the first place, or maybe involving oneself in same-gender relationships is part of the necessary ritualistic regime for<i>maintaining</i>powers. This makes the metaphor a better fit, in that it can more comfortably be stretched to accommodate various real-life cases.</li>\n<li>Instead of "being homosexual", anybody with superpowers is somehow genderqueer \u2014 including<i>any</i>deviation from the mainstream cisgenderheterosexual paradigm: people who identify as homosexual, people who don't fit in their assigned gender, people who see themselves as asexual, etc. Maybe what superpowers come bundled with is, actually, just a heightened perception of how artificial and fucked-up the assumed social norm is, which makes them more conscious of/responsive to their own individual way(s) of defying it. This actually changes the metaphor to a broader one which I think is less at risk of breaking under rough handling.</li></ul></blockquote>\nDefinitely digging a combination of these. I like the bit about sexual desires/attraction being the catalyst for powers developing in the first place. As far as the powers themselves, I'm thinking along the lines of The 4400/Heroes television series. Each person gets a certain ability, and it's up to them what they do with it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Rafaele, that's awesome!<br/>What if superpowers don't cause queer identity, but rather, queer behaviour causes superpowers?</blockquote>\nYes it is awesome. And what if indeed...?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>How much more powerful is it to just say that in this game world, the governments discourage vigilantee justice and have conservative anti-gay elements in them that prevent them from embracing the supers as government military/police/etc. agents in an open way and therefore you don't have any government backed superteams or superagents or whatever.<br/><br/>If I were playing this setting, I'd set it in a right-here-right-now, things-just-recently-changed version of the present world. I'd play in the US, with Obama as the first present representing a significantly underrepresented group trying to figure out how to deal with this other significantly underrepresented group that now has superpowers. That's awesome stuff to work with.</blockquote>\nFuck yes, it is. You've convinced me, Rob. I definitely want to go the bolder route and just up and say it: this game is about the real world, and what would happen if this particularly marginalized group of people discovered that among them, there are those with the power to fight back as they see fit.\n<blockquote>If I were to build it out as a hack, I'd see if I could put together something that captures everything awesome about Smallville and Monsterhearts into a cohesive whole - both games that hit hard on relationship mechanics in settings where kool powerz are present as theme and flavor elements.</blockquote>\nInteresting. I haven't thought about it much in mechanical terms, though Monsterhearts/AW was certainly a system that came to mind. I mean, sex moves are a no-brainer here, for one. And Strings/Hx/relationships are definitely more important to me here than kewl powerz, which I mentioned above. Dude. I am really liking your ideas. And Rafael's are phenomenal as well!<br/>Whelp, I need a copy of Smallville now, too it seems.

We have a set of strong, subtly or non-subtly enforced societal defaults, thus a large number of people have the choice actually made for them without even thinking about it. And then, instead, some people find they can't <i>not</i> stop and think about it.

This is a real problem, because the show seems to be drawing a distinction, prompting a rigorous reader, one perhaps suspicious of allegory, to insist that the vampires can\u2019t possibly be in some general way stand-ins for queer folk because the show already possesses these latter, and they are not coterminous with the vampires.

I mean, gays (and I'm using that as shorthand here for LGBTQAETC) are just as likely to mistrust supers as straight people are. It's about the loneliness of being saddled with the responsibility of having power that others don't, while being complicated by the fact that in order to take up the mantle of that responsibility, you have to display a part of yourself that, while becoming more and more accepted in the mainstream, prevents you from having all the rights and freedoms of "normals." Throw in regulation against supers, and we've got ourselves statements to be made. I think that the allegory side by side with the reality complicates things more than it does water it down.

North Carolina became the latest state to vote (by a wide margin) to ban same-sex marriage. Virginia just had a gay prosecutor be denied the position of judge because he "is likely to be an activist instead of interpreting laws fairly," though nothing on his record suggests that, except his candor about being gay.<br/><br/>So I thought, "I wonder what these people would think if all of their heroes were gay?" At the moment, I meant people like Jesus, Ghandi, Harriet Tubman, et al, but from there it wasn't a leap (over tall buildings in a single bound) to gay superheroes. As I said, the theocracy thing was just an afterthought, to kind of actually soften the blow and keep it fantastical, but I really think Rob is right in saying that this would be most effective if we're talking "real life, as it is now, but with queer superheroes."<br/><br/>Also, I have to confess that though other parts of LGBTQAI did pop into my head post-spitballing (after writing the OP), originally the (working) title was just going to be <i>Superheroes are Gay.</i> To be honest, I still kind of like how it subverts the use of the word "gay" as pejorative, instead being literal.
