Like most people who\u2019ve voiced an opinion on the matter, Fiasco is best introduced to new players with a fairly mundane playset, like Main Street USA or Tales from Suburbia. (And if you\u2019ve never played Fiasco, please don\u2019t let the word \u201cmundane\u201d scare you off in this context \u2013 the simplest playsets can yield some of the best Fiascos). Since my own playset isn\u2019t particularly mundane (a creepy gothic manor with the potential for werewolves, vampires and other supernatural creatures), I\u2019ve been hesitant to bring it to the table, particularly with newbies. But, in spite of that, with Halloween coming up, I found myself playing it with four brand-new players -- and it went pretty well!<br/><br/>My playset is called Stonefalcon Manor. You can download it here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg/edit?pli=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0Ut5mF-spZyZ1pnTXUxRFFxOTg/edit?pli=1</a><br/><br/>(If you download it and play it, please send me feedback \u2013 or post an Actual Play/Session report! I am also working on the following playsets, to various degree of completion: a reality-TV show, a high-school reunion and an upper-crust boarding school.)<br/><br/>As with a few other Fiasco playsets, mine involves \u201cstunt\u201d dice -- four red dice that replace a total of two black and two white dice and signal something specific to the story. In my case, anytime a red die is taken, the story reveals another clue to the dreaded Secret of Stonefalcon Manor (because all creepy gothic manors have at least one big secret). I considered leaving the stunt dice out for our first game, but we went ahead and used them. The players were a little confused at first, but it worked out pretty well overall.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393341/#Comment_393341" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T16:44:17+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  4:44PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><b>Characters</b></i><br/><br/><i><b>Dr. Nicolas St. Barnes (me): </b></i>An evil psychologist, who will attempt to blackmail the Harrington family over their Frankenstein-like shenanigans.

They have their illicit trysts in the woods in the dead of night to avoid prying eyes around the village. As he returns (five minutes after her, to minimize suspicion), he passes the bay\u2026 and sees a horrible creature rising. It is roughly humanoid but much larger than any man Nicolas has ever seen, and from the distance, it appears to have a distorted and deformed face. He realizes this is the same sort of beast children claimed to see skulking around at night six years or so ago. He vows to get to the bottom of it, but loses the trail of the creature in the dark\u2026 right near the gates to Stonefalcon Manor.  <br/><br/>The next morning, Lord Malcolm Harrington is in his secret laboratory underneath Stonefalcon Manor, berating his son/lackey Steven for the lad\u2019s poor choice in a bride. Steven and his new wife, Fanny, just returned to Stonefalcon Manor the previous night, and Malcolm is not impressed with his daughter-in-law. She is too simple, too bland and quite frankly too common to be a Harrington. Malcolm cannot believe he let Steven leave for university six years ago (CLUE ALERT), not if the young man was just going to end making such poor life choices. Malcolm demands his son get a divorce from the unworthy spouse, but Steven meekly refuses. So Malcolm threatens his son: If Steven doesn\u2019t divorce Fanny, then Fanny will find herself the subject of Malcolm\u2019s next underground experiment. Steven sadly agrees to his father\u2019s demands.<br/><br/>Steven goes upstairs, not sure how to proceed. He finds Fanny in their room, and she is quite happy to see him, greeting him with a big kiss. He tries to bring up the subject of divorce, but she keeps talking over him, asking questions about what the village is like, whether she will make friends, and so on. Finally she opens her dresser and pulls out a creepy little doll \u2013 two arms, two legs, a torso and a hideous face. She claims she found it under their bed and wants to know why on Earth someone would have such a horrible thing around. Has Steven ever seen it before? Steven\u2019s eyes grow wide. \u201cGive me that!\u201d he cries, grabbing the doll and running out of the room.<br/><br/>Steven does not return, so Fanny eventually ventures out to the village. She finds a small cafe where she encounters Nicolas. He introduces himself as the psychologist at the nearby asylum. When Fanny explains that she is Steven Harrington\u2019s bride, Nicolas immediately becomes interested. Fanny confesses that she had once sought psychiatric care back in London, then immediately blushes. Nicolas assures her she has nothing to be ashamed of and that their conversation will remain strictly confidential. In fact, he says that if she is interested, he has a small local office and he\u2019s happy to have an informal chat with her later if she feels the need. Fanny is a bit reassured; she doesn't necessarily agree, but she doesn't necessarily disagree either.<br/><br/>That night, Nicolas finishes up his \u201csexual therapy\u201d in the woods with Clara a bit early. She leaves as usual and he follows her\u2026 but instead of going home, he waits near the bay. He waits and waits for the creature to emerge again. But he sees nothing. He\u2019s just about to leave when he feels a hand on his shoulder. He panics and whirls around. But it\u2019s only Clara \u2013 the little dolt has gotten lost in the darkness. Nicolas sighs and offers to discreetly walk her home, but suddenly Clara\u2019s eyes grow wide. Nicolas whirls back around. Standing right behind him is the creature from the bay! It roars loudly and raises its fists. Nicolas dodges, but Clara takes a blow. Nicolas doesn\u2019t care, though; he runs away as fast as he can, listening to Clara\u2019s cries and sobs as he goes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Malcolm is back in his lab and has a flashback to around 20 years ago, when he visited a dreary London orphanage. The orphanage caretaker is impressed to see someone with so much money and keeps apologizing for the filthy state of her boys. Malcolm doesn\u2019t pay her (or most of the boys) much mind. But when he encounters Steven, his gaze focuses. \u201cThat one,\u201d he demands, pointing at Steven. \u201cThat one will serve my needs.\u201d<br/><br/>The next morning, Steven gets up early (before Fanny) and goes for a walk near the bay. He is still distraught about having to divorce her\u2026 and about the doll. He takes the hideous creature from his coat and aims to throw it into the bay. But before he can, he sees something. Washed up on the shore is a body. Clara\u2019s body. \u201cDid I do this?\u201d he whispers. He drops the doll and runs.<br/><br/>Later, Fanny has taken Nicolas up on his offer. She sees him at his office. His charm and grace helps her let down her guard. She tells him her problems \u2013 feeling alone, fighting with Steven, sensing Malcolm\u2019s disapproval and so on. But when she mentions the doll, Nicolas truly gets interested. Fanny brushes it off, though, and doesn\u2019t stay much beyond that. She thanks Nicolas, saying that just talking has made her feel better. Nicolas gets a wicked smile when she leaves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393343/#Comment_393343" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T16:45:53+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  4:45PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><b>Tilt</b></i><br/>* Tragedy: Death, right on time<br/>* Guilt: Greed leads to killing<br/><br/><i><b>Act 2</b></i><br/>The next day, Fanny returns to Nicolas\u2019s office. She is one again upset. She found something. A letter. Well, part of a letter to be accurate. The note has been torn in half lengthwise, so it\u2019s hard to understand exactly what\u2019s going on. But a few words are clear. \u201cMonster.\u201d \u201cEvil.\u201d \u201cDoll.\u201d \u201cSorry.\u201d \u201cMother.\u201d Malcolm suggests she leave the note in his care (\u201cso that you\u2019re no longer burdened with it\u201d), but Fanny is unsure. Malcolm keeps pushing, which does nothing to reassure Fanny. \u201cGood day, Dr. St. Barnes,\u201d she says abruptly, before leaving his office, letter in hand.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the Stonefalcon Manor laboratory, Malcolm asks Steven that status of Steven\u2019s pending divorce from Fanny. Steven hems and haws and finally admits that he hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to bring it up to Fanny yet. Malcolm reminds his son of the consequences for Fanny if Steven refuses this obligation, pointing to the operating table. In a rare show of backbone, Steven cries out, \u201cI won\u2019t let you turn her into an evil creature like you did me! I won\u2019t!\u201d He pushes his father to the ground and runs out of the room.<br/><br/>Steven has just gotten upstairs when he hears the doorbell ring. It\u2019s Nicolas. They somewhat knew of each other before Steven left for university, but were never really friends (Nicolas being a teenager and all). Steven (anxious to away before his father gets upstairs) rudely asks Nicolas what he wants. Not beating around the bush, Nicolas bluffs a bit, pretending he knows more about the creature than he does. Bottom line: The Harringtons will pay Nicolas a weekly stipend for him to keep his silence about what he\u2019s seen and learned. Steven just scoffs, pushing past Nicolas and rushing out of the manor. Nicolas, a bit miffed but happy to be left alone in the home, begins to snoop.<br/><br/>Fanny comes downstairs to find Nicolas in the manor, about to enter the basement. She\u2019s surprised to see him, but he quickly comes up with an excuse that he was concerned after their last meeting and only came to check up on her. Not quite believing him, she says she\u2019s fine and suggests he leave now. But instead, Nicolas begins quizzing her more on the note, on the Harrington Family and on the doll. Fanny, of course, has no answers\u2026 but he father-in-law does. Lord Harrington emerges from the basement, perhaps a bit madder than usual due to the blow his head he suffered from his fight with Steven. He triumphantly proclaims his genius, his ability to harness man\u2019s inner beast, how he was able to experiment on Steven so that his son turned into a monster at nights. In a plot twist that probably made more sense in our game than it will in this write-up, Malcolm was able to harness Steven\u2019s evil energy into the doll during the daytime, but some nights (particularly nights during which Steven was under great stress), the energy would magnify and return to Steven, turning him into the creature. Malcolm is a bit sad when he recalls that Steven killed his own mother (Malcolm\u2019s wife) during one such instance \u2013 but it was all in the name of science. Fanny and Nicolas both think Malcolm is crazy, but it doesn\u2019t matter; he pulls a gun on them and explains that they won\u2019t live to share the Secret of Stonefalcon Manor. Malcolm fires at Nicolas as Fanny runs back upstairs. <br/><br/>Nicolas lays dying with a gunshot wound to his chest. \u201cI was\u2026 I was\u2026 going to be rich\u2026\u201d he mumbles. \u201cKnowledge is the only wealth,\u201d Malcolm reminds him. Malcolm finishes Nicolas with a gunshot to the head and then goes upstairs for Fanny.<br/><br/>Fanny leads Malcolm on a wild chase, in and out of upstairs manor rooms. But finally, he corners her in the master bedroom. Right where Steven killed Lady Harrington. \u201cGoodbye, you cheap dolt,\u201d Malcolm says as he aims the pistol.<br/><br/>Steven returns to Stonefalcon Manor to find Nicolas\u2019s body lying at the foot of the stairs. \u201cFanny!\u201d he cries, running upstairs. He finds her, held at gunpoint by his insane father. Steven demands Malcolm stop, but Malcolm just laughs. So, Steven does what he has never done before: He turns into the creature\u2026 at will\u2026 and during broad daylight. Malcolm is stunned. Fanny is horrified. As the now-horrific Steven pounces on his father, Fanny rushes out of the room. A gunshot is heard.<br/><br/>Fanny races downstairs, but trips on Nicolas\u2019s body. She lies on the floor, prone, and hears footsteps behind her. She begins sobbing as she slowly rolls over. She sees Steven coming down the stairs. Her Steven. Not the monster. He is holding his shoulder, bleeding from a gunshot wound, but it is not life-threatening. \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he says to her. \u201cIt\u2019s really over.\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393344/#Comment_393344" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T16:46:25+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  4:46PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><b>Aftermath</b></i><br/>Nicolas was dead, but his reputation lived beyond him. He became a bit of a posthumous pillar of the community, and many young men aspired to be a valued, philanthropic psychiatrist just like him. Of course, most of these young men ended up seducing and/or blackmailing their innocent patients, so his reputation lived on in more ways than one.<br/><br/>Malcolm is not dead, but utterly defeated. Defeated by his own son, the boy he\u2019d brought into his home to raise as his own. Malcolm gives up on science and replaces it with alcohol. Steven begins taking care of the family accounts, leaving Malcolm but a small stipend to spend on spirits. Malcolm becomes the laughingstock around the village and freezes to death one night in an alley.<br/><br/>Steven and Fanny have many happy years together. But it does not last. The monstrous impulses he thought he had under control return, and he once again becomes the evil creature he so fought against. One night, he tries to attack a villager, but the villager has come armed. Steven is shot in the chest, causing him to revert back to human form for his last few moments. He dies, just as Fanny arrives, shame in her eyes at what her husband has once again become. With his last breath, he realizes that she could have never truly loved something as horrendous as he truly was.<br/><br/>After this, Fanny is but a shell of herself. The only happiness in her life comes from the son she bore before Steven\u2019s death. Silas is her pride and joy and the spitting image of his beloved father. But that\u2019s not all he has in common with her father. On Silas\u2019s 16th birthday, he has his first transformation into a nightmarish monster. And on that night\u2026 he kills Fanny in the exact spot where Steven saved her all those years ago. The exact spot where Steven killed his own mother. <br/><br/>The Secret of Stonefalcon Manor does not end.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jkl620" title="jkl620"><img alt="jkl620" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jkl620">jkl620</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404120/#Comment_404120" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T11:01:06+00:00" title="January 20, 2013 11:01AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a fun one that went pretty well for players first time.<br/>I have never used stunt dice before.

The basic rule for Stunt Dice is that they are different-colored dice that are added to a playset instead of some black and white dice. Usually, it seems like it's a total of four red stunt dice substituted for two black and two white regular dice. <br/><br/>The Fiasco Companion gives a good overview on how you can incorporate Stunt Dice into any playset, but some playsets (like mine above and Camp Death) have playset-specific ways to use Stunt Dice. <br/><br/>In the case of the write-up above, I'm relying on memory here, and I just played the same playset last week using some of the same elements, so I may be misremembering. But here's what I think it was:<br/>* First red die: The bad things started happening six years ago (first die is rolled, and that number is somehow incorporated into the Secret)<br/>* Second red die: The doll is introduced (for the second die, two dice are rolled and a corresponding Object or Location is incorporated into the Secret)<br/>* Third red die: Steven blurts out that he has been turned into an evil creature (third red die signifies a high-level reveal of the Secret)<br/>* Fourth red die: Lord Harrington reveals all, explaining what has been going on with Steven and the doll (fourth red die signifies a bigger explanation behind the Secret and how things tie together)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
