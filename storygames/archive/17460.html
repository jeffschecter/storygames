As a fan of 4e and Maid RPG, I was right at home. When I played it with my friends we used old MUSCLE figures for PCs and various little toys for a lot of the enemies. One of my characters was a psychic gorilla-man who became the Mind-King of the Huahuas (a race of mutant chihuahuas) after the party defeated their queen, which was about the tone our games tended to have.<br/><br/>Being a 4e-derivative it thrives on set piece battles (though the contents of the set pieces can be really out there), and although it's set up to give you 10 levels, it seems to be so weird and spazzy that its strengths are more for one-shots and mini-campaigns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395400/#Comment_395400" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T11:31:46+00:00" title="October 30, 2012 11:31AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Ewen is writing about the <i>seventh</i> edition of Gamma World, released in 2010. It's based on 4th edition D&amp;D rules, whence the confusion.)<br/><br/>I've played the game in one-shots now and then, perhaps half a dozen sessions in total. It's never been satisfying, possibly because 4th edition D&amp;D is not much as a one-shot game when played by the book.<br/><br/>I'd say that Gamma World is essentially the same game as D&amp;D 4th edition, except more random and therefore more volatile. If you play by the book then you'll also need to be able to handle total party kills. I'm very fond of the game being a boxed set with everything you need to play in one box, including cardboard tokens for figures. Just like 4th edition D&amp;D it's only going to work for you if either you're satisfied with a mediocre miniatures skirmish game, or you're willing to make the game your own with a strong GM and a strong vision for what the campaign's going to be about. Either of those is cool with me, I hasten to add: it's not a sin to like the game for how it does the miniatures skirmish thing. I'd like it if it was a computer game, but on tabletop it's too much setup effort and too much frustration when the heroes inevitably lose a fight. Just like its D&amp;D cousin, the game has a solid combat system but little in the way of strategic layer to give context for the fights; I could take it more easily if it just gave you points budgets and instructed you to play independent skirmishes like your average miniatures war game does.<br/><br/>If you don't have 4th edition D&amp;D in some form, then I recommend Gamma World as a less pointlessly expansive version - even as I don't think that 4th edition is very good as a game, it's an ambitious design that everybody serious about tabletop design should sample. Gamma World just has all the key parts in a much smaller package, which makes it better than D&amp;D for this purpose. If you already have 4th edition D&amp;D, then I'd say that Gamma World only makes sense if you're hardcore and own all the D&amp;D sourcebooks anyway; then Gamma World goes in as one more, you can treat it as a gonzo scifi setting for 4th with little trouble. If you're just moderately into 4th edition, then getting Gamma World doesn't make sense to me - you already have all the good bits, and are probably able to cut then down into something similar to Gamma World for yourself if you want a lighter version.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395403/#Comment_395403" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T11:52:33+00:00" title="October 30, 2012 11:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've had fun with it when we've played it.

A lot like 4E in that sense, but -- as Eero says -- more self-contained and in a more ridiculous package that helps smooth over some of the inconsistencies and poor design choices. There's many ideas worth stealing from it! But I'd rather steal than play a lot of it straight.

I love the wackiness, love being able to use very strange and random figures on the battlemaps. I 've also been able to use some of my Star Wars minis maps and pieces to create battle areas on the fly. The sense of humor throughout is pretty cool and overall is a smooth game.<br/><br/>I've been tinkering with using the playtest D&amp;D 5E mechanic Advantage/Disadvantage along with the Gamma World junk tables. Basically if a player figures out a way to use a piece of junk for a check, they get to make the roll twice. Gives a bit more life and use to the random junk tables, which are a lot of fun.<br/><br/>For example, one of the characters found a remote control and then later some batteries. Later the character made a Science check from a range to turn off an enemy machine using the remote.
