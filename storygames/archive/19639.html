In other words, this number is equal to 10<br/>minus your to-hit, so if you have a +3 to hit, it\u2019s 7. Note this on your sheet next to the attack and change it when that to hit bonus changes.<br/><br/>Once you have deduced or learned the target\u2019s AC, you can know what you have to roll by adding your thac10 to the AC minus ten \u2014 for AC\u2019s in the teens, it\u2019s the last digit. So if you have a noted thac10 of seven and you\u2019re fighting against a monster with an AC of 14, you know that your rolls have to be 11 or higher to hit (since 7+4 = 11) and thus you can instantly see whether or not you hit.<br/><br/>Very satisfying and fast!<br/><br/>The good part about this is that you can do it on your own without having to introduce a house rule to the rest of the table. Just note the \u201cthac10\u201d on your character sheet (or monster stat block, if you\u2019re DM) and pay attention to the last digit of the AC or DC so you know what to beat. This works for the other abilities on your sheet, too.<br/><br/>The bad part is that the game wasn\u2019t made this way from the beginning. Standards have their uses and this method is non-standard and confusing. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>Another example is if you have a +2 dex. You can note that that gives you a thdc10 of 8. To beat a standard DC 15 challenge you have to roll a 13 or higher since 8 + 5 is 13.<br/><br/>(You can also subtract your bonus from the AC or DC. This has always worked and lately we played Adventure System games, such as Castle Ravenloft, that way. That way you don\u2019t need the thac10 noted. But subtraction is subtraction... so I came up with this (and later realized that I must\u2019ve gotten it from ACKS, which I have read).)<br/><br/>Honestly I\u2019m not even sure that 8 + 5 is easier than 15 - 2. So maybe this method isn\u2019t the best! Give it a try!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436243/#Comment_436243" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T12:10:16+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 12:10PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't this exactly how D&amp;D always worked?<br/><br/>In any case, all these methods sound pretty interchangeable to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436251/#Comment_436251" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T12:50:29+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 12:50PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're different ways the count - the math is identical, it's just that some people find it easier to sum first and then roll against a target number, vs. rolling first and then totaling the roll + modifier.<br/><br/>I would myself assume that if it's easier to roll against a target number, and you know the AC (a big if often enough), then the easiest target number is surely AC - [hit bonus], which Sandra notes in passing. Just like with THAC0 (or THAC10) you get a single number against which your d20 roll can be compared. The advantage is that it's simpler to derive and more flexible, disadvantage is that you have to do subtraction.<br/><br/>Considering the different counting methods that people have suggested for the D&amp;D math over the years, it seems to me that there are basically three usability issues that impact different people to different degrees:<br/><b>*</b> Some dislike summing two-digit numbers.<br/><b>*</b> Some dislike subtraction.<br/><b>*</b> Some dislike having to do math after the roll - before the roll is fine, but they want instant result when the dice hit the table, and that means a target number.<br/>In addition to those three concerns there's the general anti-concern demographic: people who don't mind messing with the numbers generally seem to prefer conceptually simple and flexible counting methods, even at the expense of having to do one or more of the things listed above.<br/><br/>Historically early D&amp;D put a huge premium on avoiding all these "turn-offs", while more recent D&amp;D has been increasingly "math-friendly": D&amp;D nowadays gives you formulas to resolve and relies on you being able to sum and compare quickly - target numbers (in the sense of a number to directly roll against) are nowhere to be seen during the last 15 years. This could mean that the type of person developing the game, or using the game, has changed since the beginning, maybe? Demographic shift or changing times, perhaps changes in math education or simple changes in expectations about how hard you should be thinking while playing? What ever the reason, it's nevertheless interesting how the preferences seem to have clearly changed over time.<br/><br/>Even with the dominant preferences becoming increasingly analytical, there are still parts of the gaming audience who would prefer D&amp;D math in a way that seems easier to them. These types of alternative counting methods serve them, just like introducing THAC0 served those who disliked the look-up tables early on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436252/#Comment_436252" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T13:08:26+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  1:08PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2014 1:09PM by 2097.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Isn't this exactly how D&amp;D always worked?<br/><br/>In any case, all these methods sound pretty interchangeable to me.</blockquote>\nYes, that\u2019s the point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>target numbers (in the sense of a number to directly roll against) are nowhere to be seen during the last 15 years.</blockquote>\n"Death saves" being one of the few exceptions.\n<blockquote>These types of alternative counting methods serve them, just like introducing THAC0 served those who disliked the look-up tables early on.</blockquote>\nI\u2019m of two minds when it comes to thac0 vs tables, having tried both.

It\u2019s not two subtractions per roll, it\u2019s one per character.<br/>(Or the game could\u2019ve been made that way, in which case you wouldn\u2019t have to \u201cconvert\u201d at all. But the conversion isn\u2019t something you\u2019d have to do constantly, only once per value.)<br/><br/>Also: of the subtractions is a subtraction from ten (meaning once you know the five pairs 1\u20139, 2\u20138, 3\u20137, 6\u20134, 5\u20135, this subtraction is easier) and the other is just looking at the last digit. 14 becomes 4.<br/>But, again \u2014 not something you need to do constantly.<br/><br/>Once you\u2019ve done that, it\u2019s one addition per \u201cmatchup\u201d, no matter how many rolls the fight take.<br/><br/>Say I\u2019m DM:ing:<br/>If one of goblin\u2019s attacks, let\u2019s say a sword, has a to-hit of +4, I can jot down a 6.<br/>If Lisa the PC has an armor class of 15, I can jot down that as a 5 somewhere.<br/>I only have to do this once and then I\u2019m set for life.<br/><br/>Now imagine the goblin is fighting Lisa with that sword. I do 6 + 5 = 11 once and then I can do any number of rolls with that pairing of goblin-sword vs Lisa, just knowing that all rolls of 11+ are hits and all below that are misses.<br/><br/>Whereas if I was doing it the standard way, I\u2019d have to add 4 to every die roll and compare it to 15. Everytime the dice hit the table I go \u201cOK, so nine plus four, that\u2019s a... miss! OK, next goblin!\u201d And I do arithmetics fast. But they\u2019re distracting, they make me think about happy math fun time rather than tense scary fighty sword time.<br/><br/>The method I suggest here does introduce more numbers to juggle and might not be worth it. Especially since the straight forward 15 - 4 = 11 is available.<br/>But I think I\u2019m going to test it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436263/#Comment_436263" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T14:30:26+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  2:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that application (particularly for the GM) makes me see what you're doing better.<br/><br/>You might also enjoy this thread, a while back, which includes my favourite reworking of d20 rolls:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18318/fixing-thac0-once-and-for-all" rel="nofollow">Fixing ThAC0...</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436280/#Comment_436280" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T01:08:15+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  1:08AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, Pendragon style.
