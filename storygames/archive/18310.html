If you've ever seen the Gantz anime, movie or readed the manga, you'll find that not even knowing what's going on or what the equipment you have can do makes investigation and experimentation an active part of the story. It's even more puzzling when your "investigation" skills don't produce much results since you're facing something totally unknown. <br/><br/>Of course, you'll still need to dosify how much information you give out from time to time, though when it appears it becomes really important, compared to games where you describe the full seting to the players in the first session... and you notice most aren't even listening XD Just stating consequences which have no apparent reason always works as a heads up for the whole party. Still there's a thin line between keeping the mistery in order to surprise the players and being unfair and tell them that opening that door had the awful consequence of killing all the party. Specially when opening that door seemed to be the only option available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412818/#Comment_412818" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T18:38:27+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  6:38PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a few solo games where mysteries were created and revealed by Story Cubes and consulting the Mythic GME.  The random element means I can keep 'secrets' from myself and develop the story based on the available  clues with the dice or chart providing confirmation or twists.  Over on the Mythic Yahoo group they're talking about how you can use a published adventure but add uncertainly by not taking the text at face value.  For example, a library may end up ransacked or a trap description might be a red herring.<br/><br/>There are also systems like Microscope where you have hidden details until they are revealed/created during play.  The survival/horror RPG Ocean is another example where the players create the world they're in and solve the mysteries by gathering and spending resources.

I could go on for pages about "why is it fun?" but instead I'll address "why is it functional?"<br/><br/>In my game <i>Delve</i>, there are rules for how magic works in the fiction.  Certain materials are required, supplemental materials can help, and the basics of creating an effect concern writing out the proper runes for the effect you want.  The players and characters start the game knowing none of this.  The <i>only</i> thing they know is "magic exists".  The game is about what secret knowledge the characters pursue and what they do with it once they have it.  So although it's possible that the magic system will never be encountered, it's extremely unlikely.  The GM's job is to offer opportunities to learn secrets, and most players choose to pursue related secrets, so once you learn one rune, you probably chase after some more.  At any given moment, there are all sorts of questions about magic that the players would like to answer, and the answers cannot be quickly or easily achieved.<br/><br/>So, why is that functional?  It's functional because it avoids the pitfalls in <b>bold</b> below.<br/><br/>First, no promises are broken; no <b>false expectations</b> are set.  "Being able to cast spells" is set up as a sort of holy grail for the characters, rather than the reason to play.  I never pitch <i>Delve</i> as "the game where you learn magic", despite some of my friends telling me that's their favorite part, because I think that phrase gives the wrong impression.  Instead I pitch Delve as a gritty, realistic, low-powered game of starting from nothing and pursuing useful secrets that you can use to gradually become something more.  Then you start playing, and each finding is pretty small, but often useful to solve a given problem that matters to someone.  So, the peasant PCs rescue the duke's daughter because they know the right herbs to smear on the magic globe she's locked in, and even if this herb lore doesn't immediately allow them to do anything else, well, hey, they've won the favor of the duke, which is a huge deal for a peasant!  "Learning the right herb to smear on this one globe" is pretty far removed from "being a wizard", so everyone's expectations remain low-powered.<br/><br/>Second, the hidden information is a feature of the setting.  If there were no magical info to learn, the setting would look very different.  If the magical info were easy to learn, the setting would look very different.  The setting's specific combo of folk wisdom, magical locations, one-off items, legends of this one wizard, and supernatural demonic threats, all points to "the truth is out there, but defies easy discovery".  If you can buy into the game's premise, then once you do, there's no <b>artificiality or contrivance</b>.  It's never necessary for the GM to tell the player, "Sorry, you're not allowed to know that yet."  <i>No one</i> can know it unless they venture into the dangers wherein the secrets lie.<br/><br/>Third, because the magic system is only usable once you know and own all the right stuff, there are no <b>game-altering</b> power shifts to worry about along the way.  The GM never has to worry about "Oops, if I give them the secret that's been promised, they'll suddenly become superheroes!" until they're 95% of the way to being wizards.  At <i>that</i> point, they've <i>earned</i> it.<br/><br/>Fourth, the process of learning the hidden info is fun.  Every step of the process involves danger and/or expending precious resources.  Do you want to use your magic dust to reveal the way out of the dungeon that's about to eat you, or do you want to pour it on this rune to learn how the rune works?  There's no <b>grinding</b> or <b>jumping through hoops</b> or <b>banging your head</b> against insoluble puzzles required.<br/><br/>Fifth, the hidden info is not required for play, so you don't run into that situation where <b>failure kills the game</b>.  If you fail to learn anything about magic, you still have monsters to fight and cool sights to see and connections to forge, etc.<br/><br/>These requirements are with an eye toward sandboxy challenge games, but I think similar concerns actually apply in a "GM's cool plot" game too.  You still want hidden info that:<br/>- won't break the game if it's acquired<br/>- won't kill the game if it isn't acquired<br/>- isn't falsely promised<br/>- isn't artificially withheld<br/>- isn't tedious to pursue<br/>The "GM's cool plot" game simply uses GM planning and management (i.e. powers during play) as the tool for ensuring all of these.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412897/#Comment_412897" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-27T15:30:54+00:00" title="April 27, 2013  3:30PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hidden information means that discovery is <i>actually discovery</i>, and not invention.

They reveal another suspect, then reveal why they can't actually be right, then reveal another, then reveal why they aren't it, then they go back and reveal why that witness person from earlier was actually the killer. And in addition to that, they reveal something about Beckett or Castle every episode - something about her mom's killer or something about their relationship or something about his family.

Hidden information feels different in play - like you could learn it an save yourself - where as made up information feels too arbitrary.<br/><br/>In my mystery and horror Matrix games players make up clues and weird stuff. Sure it is unknown and it works as a game but it is more an act of creative writing (or trading insults, trying to pin the murder on one another) than investigating what is true.<br/><br/>The trouble with hidden information games is coordinating who knows what and keeping all the secrets straight. Mind boggling! I used to run Free Kriegspiels called "Personal perspective battles". The players were separated, with bad maps, given information by a GM of only what they could see. Orders were coordinated and crazy bad things always happened. Fun for the GM but dead boring for the players because they were so slow. The GM had to have a phenomenal memory.<br/><br/>With some Matrix games I did back in the 90's players were planning crimes. In one game at Gen Con the players didn't include two of the players in their gang (my wife and a young teenage guy) BIG MISTAKE! Terri knew about making secret arguments so she and the other guy formed their own gang and carried out the crime before the other side did - leaving them to take the fall. This game had a non-player referee who knew everything but didn't have the power to make anything happen. The lesson was that whenever anyone starts making secret arguments you'd best make and argument to learn their secret or be ready to be screwed when it is revealed. Great fun - and was real hidden information but could easily fall into the too many secrets problem.<br/><br/>So, I think that the idea can be done in a story game setting (not just in a D+D dungeon crawl setting) but do distinguish between made up and pre-existing secrets.<br/><br/>Hope this was helpful.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413263/#Comment_413263" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T06:55:43+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  6:55AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> how well does Delve work after you've played once and learned how all the magic works?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">@RobMcDiarmid</a>: I'd be careful using Castle for thinking about mystery, IME it really isn't mystery, at least as I think of it.

"Mystery" as a genre is really hard in all forms though, because the reveal needs to come at a specific time, so every accusation before then must be wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413339/#Comment_413339" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T00:04:01+00:00" title="May  2, 2013 12:04AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, if you've been playing your Delve character for two years and you finally decipher how to make spells do more or less what you want most of the time, I'm guessing you're going to keep playing that character and learning the next batch of secrets, rather than starting from scratch as another ignorant peasant.<br/><br/>But if you do want to start from scratch as another ignorant peasant, there are a few options:<br/>1) Pursue different supernatural secrets than "how to make spells".  History, geography, and demonology are also littered with useful magic stuff that has nothing to do with the rune language.<br/>2) GM uses the "how to create a a magic system" instructions to create a different set of answers to the questions of what spell-casting requires.  This implies a different version of the world, though, so I'd say "no running into your old character!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413355/#Comment_413355" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T03:47:53+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  3:47AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Do you mean spontaneously create new information in a brilliant way?
