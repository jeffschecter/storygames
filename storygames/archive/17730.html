Be alert for ice in clear zones and under bridges\u2026\u201d</i><br/><br/>Our hero trudges out, snow shovel in hand, to do their duty \u2013 clear the drive. \u201cGot to do it before the family arrive.\u201d  This is a game about what the hero thinks about as they work.<br/><br/>Each player in the game is one voice in the hero\u2019s brain. They all have an agenda and each one wants to control the hero\u2019s mind. The voices are as follows: Dreamer, Regret, Self-Loathing, Anger, Happy Joy,  and Anxiety.<br/><br/>There is no game master but one player does act as the game host. The host picks who starts. The first player briefly describes what part of the drive they are working on and then says what they hero is thinking. This might be something simple or be an elaborate day dream or fantasy, If no one challenges the thought then it happens and the player scores a victory point. Each player gets one challenge per turn. They can put forward an alternate thought to replace the first one. The two players roll 2d6. The high roller wins, re-roll ties. The winner gets the victory point. Other players who haven\u2019t used their challenge yet may challenge the challenger \u2013 till everyone has had a chance to say something. People don\u2019t have to challenge though, when players may up real cool ideas (ie good story telling) they likely won\u2019t get challenged.<br/><br/>After the turn is over each player may give another victory point to any player who did something (even if it didn\u2019t win) to reward fun stories. <br/><br/>Each player gets to start a turn. After going around the table once the game ends. The player with the most victory points wins. They are the voice that the hero listens to for the rest of the holiday. The winning player ends the game by saying how the holiday turns out. <br/><br/>That should do it.<br/><br/>Chris Engle <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401427/#Comment_401427" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-21T08:33:43+00:00" title="December 21, 2012  8:33AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started thinking about a game like this this morning (when I was shoveling snow).

I didn't get very far in ten minutes I'm afraid but here's what scribbles I got down:<br/><b>How the Elves Saved Christmas (Working title)</b><br/>Each player is one of Santa's elves. But disaster! Santa had a bad batch of Eggnog and has called in sick... on Christmas eve! It's up to a daring team of elves to take his place.<br/><i>Step one: Which elf is which</i><br/>Every player plays one elf. Each elf has stats - agility (for getting down chimneys), sneaking (for not waking up kids), intelligence (for getting the right presents), wrangling (for controlling the sleigh). Stats are from 2-5.<br/><i>Step two: delivering the presents</i><br/>Each turn represents the elves delivering to a new home, or town or continent (or something.) If the players can survive seven turns, they've delivered all the gifts!<br/><br/>Each delivery involves tasks, and each turn tasks are assigned randomly. The tasks are:<br/><b>Controlling the Sleigh</b><br/>The team starts with 9 reindeer. The pilot(?) must roll 1d6 and add their wrangling. If their score is over the current number of reindeer, all good. Else, they lose one! [no, wait.. that doesn't make sense. Some kind of strength test required though.] <br/><b>Get the right presents</b><br/>The present-getter must check his list and grab the right gift - naughty or nice. <br/>Make sure the gift is naughty or nice, and don't drop it out the sleigh! If you get the wrong gift you lose a present.<br/><b>Deliver the gift</b><br/>[agility test] to get down the chimney?<br/>[sneaky test] to avoid being spotted by the children<br/>[agility] to get back up...<br/><br/>If you don't deliver to enough kids before running out of reindeer, or presents, or wake up too many children, it's game over!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy" title="TheOtherTracy"><img alt="TheOtherTracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/711/nUY8JIY0C5ZHL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheOtherTracy">TheOtherTracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401430/#Comment_401430" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-21T09:06:55+00:00" title="December 21, 2012  9:06AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might have taken me longer than 10 minutes, but I wrote it this morning before I knew this challenge existed:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17729/the-longest-night-first-very-rough-draft#Item_1" rel="nofollow">The Longest Night</a><br/><br/>It's a link to another post here on SG.
