The primary goals are to accomplish your characters' goals for the Ordeal while retaining control of the narrative as the Chronicler. The Chronicler position is the 'football' that you need to have in order to get anything significant done. In order to get the position, you need to have your characters clash with the others in order to get control.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459136/#Comment_459136" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T14:26:08+00:00" title="January 10, 2017  2:26PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.

Always take advantage of one of the types of sorcery in the game. Story-wise, all of it is nasty except for Blessed magic. I had the honor of creating the first Hero in the game. I built Andru along the lines of an anime wandering swordsman. I made him using almost no sorcery, and Ralph's Iron Lord handed me my head (figuratively.)<br/><br/>I had the opportunity later to redesign Andru for use later in the saga. This time, I gave him a rune-forged sword and scabbard. In Blood Red Sands, Runes are extremely distasteful since their creation involves torturing someone to death and using the position they died in as the Rune. I had conceived of Andru as being a good character, but really needed that magic. So I compromised. He created the sword and scabbard from the souls of his former lover and the best friend that she had cheated on him with. It was nasty, but that act of passion completely fit the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459160/#Comment_459160" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-10T23:01:15+00:00" title="January 10, 2017 11:01PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.
