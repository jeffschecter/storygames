Or, perhaps, certain characters are passed through the time zones (IAWA might be interesting this way). Or something.</blockquote>\nI've been thinking a bit more about the logistics of doing this. To make it work, the idea would be to run "sessions" of a certain length at spots equally distributed around the planet. Each session would contain mostly gaming, but would end with a "hand off" period.<br/><br/>This hand off would be time for the GM (or whole group) to pass the story along to the GM (or whole group) of the next session, and for the next session to do a bit of planning before they start. Chances are any overall storyline would get pushed pretty far off the rails, so this period would allow the next session to adapt to that to keep the story moving. Also, any logistics that might be needed could get handled here. For example, if a character gets killed in a session, a replacement character might get figured out during this time. Or maybe people could post about it or whatever before the next session starts.<br/><br/>The trick to the whole thing is figuring out what length of session works to place the location of each session in a spot on the globe where people might actually game.<br/><br/>A <b>three hour</b> session time would allow the sessions in eight different places, but is almost certainly too short. It also inevitably places a few of the sessions in some odd spots, like Greenland and Mongolia.<br/><br/>A <b>four hour</b> session duration would allow six sessions. Looking at a map, this sequence of locations seems like the most likely:\n<ol><li>Session One: New Zealand</li><li>Session Two: Perth, Manila, Hong Kong or Shanghai</li><li>Session Three: Afghanistan (likely would need to draft some military players for this one) or the Seychelles</li><li>Session Four: London or Paris</li><li>Session Five: Newfoundland or Buenos Aires (you could probably cheat a bit here and use New York, even though it is really a time zone off)</li><li>Session Six: Los Angeles or Seattle or some other US West Coast city</li></ol>\nA <b>five hour</b> session duration would allow five sessions, one of which would need to be slightly short (you could even this out by making each one four hours and 48 minutes). The benefits of this duration are that it provides a comfortable four hour playing time with a good buffer between sessions.\n<ol><li>Session One: Sydney</li><li>Session Two: Mumbai</li><li>Session Three: London</li><li>Session Four: New York</li><li>Session Five: Hawaii</li></ol>\nA <b>six hour</b> session duration would allow four sessions, but this is probably too long. Also, I don't see a good way to line up the locations, without at least one of them being in a weird spot or missing a fairly large concentration of gamers. About the best I can come up with is:\n<ol><li>Session One: New Zealand</li><li>Session Two: Somewhere in India or Burma</li><li>Session Three: London</li><li>Session Four: Chicago</li></ol>\nAnother possibility would be:\n<ol><li>Session One: Sydney</li><li>Session Two: Afghanistan</li><li>Session Three: Sao Paulo</li><li>Session Four: San Francisco or Portland or some other US West Coast city</li></ol>\nAny preferences?<br/><br/>Also, what game(s) would lend themselves to this? (Consider that this could be a multi-day event, with the story rounding the world several times.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306276/#Comment_306276" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-29T17:04:09+00:00" title="December 29, 2010  5:04PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Wicked Age would be super cool for this, I think.
