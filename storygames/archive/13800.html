Some games make without it, or; they let the players make it. But most games are sold with a setting. The setting normally works as a framework for the identity and actions of the characters, from which the fiction (narrative, drama) spring forth.<br/><br/>The above is only to give some basis for a discussion on how we make such settings functional. <br/><br/><b>Here's my questions:</b><br/><br/>- How much setting is too much? How little will fail to support the players? <br/><br/>- What are the tricks and tools available to us as designers? How do we write our settings? How do we organize the elements of the setting? What are the different kinds of setting-elements we have at our disposal?<br/><br/>- How do we get players to use our setting?  How do we present it? What is the relationship between setting and method (system, rules, mecanics)? How do the characters fit into the picture?<br/><br/><br/>A lot of big questions, I know, but still; I hope it can be a sound basis for a talk on this side of role-playing games.

I enjoy researching, making maps and documents, and breathing life into it. I've learned that this sort of foundational pre-play can be valuable, but requires a gentle touch - everything you create is fair game for other players to re-contextualize, re-interpret, and ignore completely. So I'd say "getting players to use your setting" is a little off-kilter; it is their setting as well, and they'll use it however they like.<br/><br/>I know there's a wide range of preference in the volume, detail, and application of setting material. Here's a good example - I recently wrote a Trail of Cthulhu adventure, and a playtester was unhappy with it because I didn't provide a map of a hotel the investigators are likely to stay in for a night. At my table, that level of detail is unnecessary; I'd just whip up a freehand sketch if it became relevant, which it probably wouldn't. But at that guy's table, the layout of the hotel was important and its absence was felt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/k.graz" title="k.graz"><img alt="k.graz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/049/nXPWPVIT01SE7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/k.graz">k.graz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312410/#Comment_312410" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T05:29:10+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  5:29AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm glad this discussion has started, because setting is something that both intrigues me and cripples me at times.

For those unfamiliar with these, they are basically subtle hints at how the story unfolds from the perspective of a researcher/writer from the future.  Of course, this can be problematic if you don't want to script an ending before you start, so I tend to emulate the writing style more than the foreshadowing element.  Just enough to hint at a more lush, well thought out setting than I actually wrote down.  I'll keep the minute details in my head, that is for certain, but unless it is critical to the way the game unfolds, there is no need to make the setting too rigid by actually writing it down for EVERYONE to see (it's usually enough if I keep it hidden in my notebooks!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312412/#Comment_312412" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T06:04:48+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  6:04AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Jason in loving to research and make setting materials but I now try to really limit myself when I make games now.

How little will fail to support the players?</blockquote>\nToo much is when your ideas are hindered by the setting. That is, you want to play a certain thing but the setting forces you to remember additional datas that aren't significant and end up becoming a burden. Example of too much: Exalted, Vampire: the Masquerade.<br/><br/>Regarding the other question. I believe that the setting should have the power to convey interesting themes. Take DitV. The setting delivers powerfully the game's premise. A game can be generic like the Solar System, but that doesn't mean that you're going to play without one. The game simply gives you instruments then leaves the freedom of creating your own setting. That is outside of the too much/too little setting. It's not that such games have no settings, they have the settings you create.<br/>A setting that is too dull, generic and fails to spur emotions can hinder a gaming experience, but then, it just creates voids players can fill IF the system allows it by giving a strong premise, or at least that is the way I feel about it.\n<blockquote>- What are the tricks and tools available to us as designers? How do we write our settings? How do we organize the elements of the setting? What are the different kinds of setting-elements we have at our disposal?</blockquote>\nTricks and tools. Hmm. I can only speak for myself. I'm a visual thinker. To the point that I remember what I read and forget what I hear. This leads me to create settings that are graphically rich and unique. Sometimes they're directly taken from fiction. Beyond the Mirror is directly and openly based on Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. So I took something that is visually intense and widely known, which also helps.<br/>Taking bits from fiction here and there often helps making things simple or at least give a first spark.\n<blockquote>- How do we get players to use our setting?  How do we present it? What is the relationship between setting and method (system, rules, mecanics)? How do the characters fit into the picture?</blockquote>\nSetting is, by how I see it, a tool through which we (partially) come to agreements regarding the shared imaginary space.<br/>I say partially because it's not the only tool.<br/>A way to have characters fit into the picture is, for loose settings, to create a scenery or subsystem of the setting and then create the characters starting from that. Shock does that. You create the shock, then issues, minutiae and only finally the *tagonists. Beyond the Mirror also does that. You create veils and characterize the setting, then you create a trigger, a location and only in the end you create characters.<br/><br/>I like settings that are expressed through fragments. A short description here, a couple hints there, and then I'm given the responsibility to breathe life into the setting and make the picture complete. Apocalypse World is great for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312417/#Comment_312417" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T06:31:58+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  6:31AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some brief thoughts.<br/>- How much setting is too much? How little will fail to support the players? <br/><br/>Too much setting is when you say 'No' to a player and they say 'But it would be really cool', and you know it would. Too much is far harder to remedy than too little, in my experience but then I'm an improv kind of GM. It might be different if I wasn't.<br/><br/>- What are the tricks and tools available to us as designers? How do we write our settings? How do we organize the elements of the setting? What are the different kinds of setting-elements we have at our disposal?<br/><br/>Post hoc justification, backfilling or whatever you want to call it, is a key part of your arsenal. Throw things at the players, take things from them, link them together when their importance has been established.<br/><br/>- How do we get players to use our setting? How do we present it? What is the relationship between setting and method (system, rules, mecanics)? How do the characters fit into the picture?<br/><br/>Players will join in if they feel that the elements of the setting correspond to the overall feel. I find this usually works best if the players have some input and discussion about world design. That's why Mortal Coil, How We Came To Live Here, My Life with Master, Duty &amp; Honour, Diaspora etc have all delivered in terms of setting in every game of them I've played. And when we aren't play games with explicit joint creation, I consult with my players about tone and feel and elephants of setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312418/#Comment_312418" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T06:35:13+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  6:35AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>I've learned through long experiment that the worlds I find intriguing are not intriguing to the general public.<br/></blockquote>\nI would love to read more about this.

If your setting is filled with dynastic history, sweeping wars, and pantheons of gods...then your starting characters should be dukes and kings and bishops and popes.  If your starting character is a farm boy dreaming about life outside of his village, then your setting should be his farm stead, his village, the neighboring village, the near by market town, the castle of the local knight, and maybe rumors of what the closest big city is like.  <br/><br/>Star Wars, I think hit the right scale here.  We don't need to know what Tatooine was like, just the parts Luke was from and important to their travels.  Each planet they encountered was boiled down to its requisite role in the overall story.  They didn't interact with the entire planet of Endor...just the part around the shield generator base and the particular terrain and people  who lived there.  I think later material got carried away with the need to fill everything in, but IMO the only parts of the setting that need to be defined in a setting book are the pieces that your starting characters would have a reason to know.  Which means most setting books contain too many details of the entirely unnecessary variety, and not enough of the actually pertinent variety.<br/><br/>NPCs are some of the most important aspect of setting.  But again, NPCs at the appropriate scale of people the characters are likely to know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312423/#Comment_312423" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T07:03:33+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  7:03AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me it's all about pragmatism, turning the setting into a set of tools that can be used at the table rather than a shitty novel that must be read and grokked before play can happen.

This, to me, is why big sprawling settings like the Forgotten Realms and the World of Darkness got so much traction: you could pick and choose how much of all of that stuff you wanted to actually play with, and could let the rest of it sit on the shelf.  If somehow it became important to know something about Waterdeep or the Tzimisce or whatever, you could pull those elements down and put them into your game; if not, you didn't have to, and you wouldn't bother.<br/><br/>Because at the table, there's definitely such a thing as too much setting, especially at the beginning of the game.  These days I'm happiest with settings whose basics can be summed up and presented to everyone on a single sheet of paper, and resent/dislike settings that require more than two sheets to describe.  I want settings where we can hit the ground running in the first session, and add in/explore more elements of it as the game moves forward.  If we start off with everyone understanding the very basics (wizards are rare and scary, it is a time of galactic civil war, cosmic rays have given some people superpowers, and so forth), that's enough to get things rolling.  More complicated concepts, the ones that actually relate directly to the game we're playing, can be introduced and explained as they become relevant.<br/><br/>I'm also a big fan of conveying setting information in multiple ways.  One of the reasons I like settings that are similar to movies and TV shows is that they convey a lot of information in a very accessible way:  you sit down with your friends and spend a few entertaining hours watching it together, and at the end of it you all have a shared understanding of what that setting looks like and sounds like and so on.  Say "post-apocalyptic outer-space exploration" and you might get a dozen or more different impressions from a gaming group; say "The Road Warrior meets Star Trek" and it gets everyone closer to a consensus.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think the dirty secret here is that setting isn't all that important, situation is.</blockquote>\nOh yeah, definitely.  Setting that doesn't connect us to good in-game situations is just dead weight, dragging the whole campaign down.  I don't care how detailed or flexible the description of the known world is, if I can't look at it and immediately see something fun and dramatic that our characters could be doing there, then it's of no use to me.  Likewise, a sketchy and vaguely-defined setting that has powerful hooks for interesting action can grab me right away.  Good settings provide a setup for a good situation:  great settings provide setups for LOTS of good situations, so that you can keep going back and doing different things there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312451/#Comment_312451" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T10:14:27+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 10:14AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>I've learned through long experiment that the worlds I find intriguing are not intriguing to the general public.<br/></blockquote>\nI would love to read more about this. Are we talking games you've run, games you've written, both?<br/><br/>Sometimes I feel defeated before even trying to sell an "intriguing world" to fellow players. Sometimes it's about how difficult it is to distillate the reasons why I find the setting compelling and therefore transmit my enthusiasm. Sometimes it's because there's no movie, comic or video game that would illustrate my personal fascination. Often it's just plain laziness. Sorry if I'm running off topic here.<br/><br/>I once wrote a game called "The Georgian Sailor" about sailor in the mid 18th Century 1720 to 1770 that really hit actual sailing hard.

But all real hard history related rather than Captain Jack Sparrow, Steam Punk, Three Musketeers, or Viking focused.

The one thing that draws me towards that game is the supreme communication of the premise. I believe we could make that game a study on how to focus the setting on interesting themes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Players will join in if they feel that the elements of the setting correspond to the overall feel.</blockquote>The relationship between the overall feel of a game, and the singular setting elements presented for your use, is quite interesting.

The less experienced may have good use of a setting, as a starting point when trying to create interesting situations. So I wonder; how do a game-designer facilitate this in his games?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I think any discussion of setting needs to first start with scale and a firm understanding of why you're designing a setting at that scale.</blockquote>That is certainly a very important point! Budding designers are a bit prone to go for BIG worlds, getting totally lost in the minutiae of history and politics that will never be of consequence to any players in their games ... if said games ever get to meet a player, that is. Most such games slides into a silent death as the fire of inspiration is drowned in the dark depths of the GIGANTIC FANTASY WORLD!<br/><br/>"Keep it simple, keep it close, and leave space for improvisation", is my advice to young designers.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>There's nothing more annoying and more wasteful than designing a continent spanning setting filled with thousands of years of history and several pantheons of gods and then expecting characters to start off as the proverbial level 1 farm boy.</blockquote>Well ... as said; I'm a setting-knitter, and as such I have made worlds a'plenty! I am such a wasteful soul!<br/><br/>But; I have had the joy of seeing farm-boys being born into my GRAND worlds, and I really enjoy playing out their small lives in the fringes of the grand stage. But then; my farm boys don't really live in the grand stage; they live in a small hamlet, and are focused on the sheep and the market, and the beautiful girl in the hamlet over the hill ...<br/>- so; I enjoy both the wasteful GRANDEUR of classical world-knitting, and the down-to-earth focus of playing he insignificant soul within such a world. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>IMO the only parts of the setting that need to be defined in a setting book are the pieces that your starting characters would have a reason to know.  Which means most setting books contain too many details of the entirely unnecessary variety ...</blockquote>Oh, but what about having the freedom to travel with your characters, exploring a greater world than the one hamlet you start in ... without the GM getting all stressed out for having to create everything on the spot?

There are other interesting venues of play too, of course. But as for this kind of play; I have found that having a simple and functional cosmology is really good.

History is written by the winners as they say, and things are rarely black and white -- let your players explore what really could have happened in their imaginations and let that affect how they paint the now of your setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_312486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312486/#Comment_312486" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T12:21:59+00:00" title="February 14, 2011 12:21PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Look at Burning Wheel's lifepaths, which are dripping with possibility and serve as the game's setting.</blockquote>Will do!

Why is it so, do you think?<br/></blockquote>\nWell, everyone's pointing at the importance of Situation.  Situation is made up of Characters acting in the Setting.  If both the characters (PCs and NPCs) and the Setting are very well defined, then there's no room for action to take place.  No matter where you go or what you do, the game has already provided all the possible information the players could create.  You end up with something like Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance.  The players can certainly <i><b>do</b></i> things but it won't end up really affecting the Situation because so rigidly set already.  It ends up that the only real options open to the players to meaningfully change the Situation are irony or deconstruction.  And those get old.<br/><br/>If both the Characters and Setting are vague, then there's nothing for the players to really latch on to.  They just wander aimlessly around looking for something to do but not really finding much.  Rolemaster would be a good example.  The game feels empty and undefined.  On the surface it looks like there's a lot of cool stuff to do, but once play starts the player-characters are just sitting in the Tavern scratching their heads going, "So where do we go from here?"<br/><br/>If one is vague and the other is well defined, it gives a route for action to flow.  The players start with something concrete from which to draw inspiration prior to play and then an area of vagueness they get to define with their actions during play.  Games with this setup are Sorcerer, Dogs in the Vineyard, The Pool, TSOY, Hero Wars, The Mountain Witch, My Life With Master, etc.  In my experience, these types of games tend to produce more consistently fun play without requiring huge amounts of work from the GM or players just to fix the text to the point where they can use it.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312532/#Comment_312532" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T15:29:25+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  3:29PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also very much on the side of those saying, "Every thing you've thrown into your setting must be immediately and clearly useable." This is another way of saying that it's part of Situation: every element should immediately impact play in some meaningful way, change the circumstances of the protagonists' lives, offer opportunities, threaten, etc.<br/><br/>List of marriage customs in different countries for a dungeon crawling game? Not great. Although some groups may find clever ways to make that important in play, for most people it's either wasted paper, or, worse, a failed promise they can't achieve in play. (Nothing worse than reading about the details of cryptography in a spy game, then dreaming about playing a codebreaking character, and finally, years later, never ever seeing that promise fulfilled because all the game rules are about hex-grid combat.)<br/><br/>So, marriage customs in small towns in a dungeon crawl game, not so good. Similar descriptions of the organization of small town communities in a game of Dogs in the Vineyard, though? Those are immediately useable in Town Creation and help you achieve the aims of play--and the text tells you how.<br/><br/>(This is all oriented at play, of course. If people love buying and reading irrelevant setting material, there's nothing wrong with that. After all, even lots of non-gamers buy books like "The World of the Star Wars Universe" or "Battleship Construction in Battlestar Gastrotica". It's just not good *game design*.<br/><br/><br/>Tomas,<br/><br/>I have a question for you!<br/><br/>As someone who looks imagining huge, sprawling campaign worlds (I enjoy this, too), how do you feel about published campaign settings? Is someone else's giant personal work of imagination useful to you? Do you study huge campaign settings and then run games in them?<br/><br/>I have a suspicion that the people who love to create huge, detailed settings--even if those details are never actually encountered in play, but as a fun hobby or creative project--I wonder if those people would also never want to buy *someone else's* giant campaign setting? After all, if you enjoy creating an imaginary world, buying someone else's robs you of your fun.<br/><br/>That's been my assumption for a while: if someone likes one of my games and likes creating hugely detailed worlds, I'm not going to stop them by writing one myself.<br/><br/>What do you think?

Very interesting points to ponder ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Is someone else's giant personal work of imagination useful to you?</blockquote>Paul, I must admit that I'm an odd person. Always have been, and always will be. My wife has given up on me, alas, but with love. So, I'm odd and loved, and lucky to be so.<br/><br/>One of my oddities is my affinity for studying and drawing maps. One other is my happiness in imagining worlds, nations, cultures and characters. But still; reading role-playing games, or setting material, is not something I like. That may be an oddity of mine too, come to think of it.<br/><br/>I do it all the same, of course, as a designer bound to investigate my field of expression. But I tend to limit my readings in the field to the games that really entices me; either by their peculiar nature, or by their obvious impact on the field. Reading settings is not part of this. I read <i>games</i>.<br/><br/>I feel that this may be true for other setting-smiths too; they love their own, and care less about other worlds. I would never dream of buying a stand-alone setting, if it was not reputed to be of extra-ordinary quality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312543/#Comment_312543" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T16:18:48+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  4:18PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense, Tomas.

I enjoy researching, making maps and documents, and breathing life into it. I've learned that this sort of foundational pre-play can be valuable, but requires a gentle touch - everything you create is fair game for other players to re-contextualize, re-interpret, and ignore completely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A page of stage setting text. A cast of interesting characters. A nice map. Some interesting cover art. A clear set of rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>IMO the scale of your setting should match the scale of your characters. If your setting is filled with dynastic history, sweeping wars, and pantheons of gods...then your starting characters should be dukes and kings and bishops and popes. If your starting character is a farm boy dreaming about life outside of his village, then your setting should be his farm stead, his village, the neighboring village, the near by market town, the castle of the local knight, and maybe rumors of what the closest big city is l</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In the book, I don't think there's necessarily such a thing as "too much," provided that it's presented clearly, can be referenced easily, and (most importantly!) can be edited to suit the needs of your gaming group. This, to me, is why big sprawling settings like the Forgotten Realms and the World of Darkness got so much traction: you could pick and choose how much of all of that stuff you wanted to actually play with, and could let the rest of it sit on the shelf.</blockquote>\nFor me, there's a real fascination in researching a setting. The other day, I found what Physics, Mathematics, Geology and Theology were like in 1850. I love that kind of thing: it adds real depth to a game.

Not the historical aspect so much (as integral as it may be). Rather through difficult, creative thinking and real intellectual labour we can think about worlds in totally different ways. To abuse that Carl Sagan quote, "If you wish to tell a story, you must first invent the universe." <br/><br/>The situation doesn't make any sense without the setting. The characters have no basis for action. I what I find odd about some settings is how similar in thinking the denizens are to our own moment. The farther you go in either space or time, the stranger other people's thoughts become. Moreover, 1850 is fairly close in ideological terms to the present, still within the modernist moment.<br/><br/>A fictional setting should really illustrate the details and specific differences to the players.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>(Nothing worse than reading about the details of cryptography in a spy game, then dreaming about playing a codebreaking character, and finally, years later, never ever seeing that promise fulfilled because all the game rules are about hex-grid combat.)</blockquote>\nI think that most trad games are deficient in this way. Sometimes, I feel as though the baby was thrown out with the bathwater with the indie movement. For many trad games, there is a second implicit premise to the game. That premise is the setting. D&amp;D's explicit premise is tactical fantasy wargaming, it's implicit premise is exploring forgotten ruins and dark temples. Vampire's explicit premise is supernatural powers that go bump in the night, it's implicit premise is blood-sucking politics, ancient magicks and shadowy underworlds. The rules don't address the implicit premise but I would guarantee that that's why many, many gamers sit down to play those games week after week. The books promised fly-by-night politics and rich Tolkienesque narratives but deliver nothing but "hex-grid combat" or lists point-buy powerz.<br/><br/>The next big design innovations could come to sooth these long held and pervasive wounds that stem from broken promises.

Not very tangible, that quality, but still any player will recognize it, when sucked into the depths of a role-playing game. I believe setting to be one of the foremost tools we have in creating depth to a game, as game-smiths. That is not to say that "lots of setting" is depth. I believe the quality of the setting elements, and their ability to inspire interaction, is crucial. And then, in some way the <i>quantity</i> also goes into it; how the setting is perceived as a whole; a possible world in itself. That is a quality a lot of players have recognized in classical role-playing games of old, and a quality lots of players miss in newer classical games with "focused premise" (Dogs in the Vineyard, My Life with Master). It is also missed in most modern games. The <i>focused premise</i> is good, but it's not catering to the <i>broad scope</i> implicit in a traditional setting. That broad scope, with the scenario working as focusing magnifying glass on some part of it, I find to be a very interesting and elusive quality.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>To abuse that Carl Sagan quote, "If you wish to tell a story, you must first invent the universe."<br/><br/>The situation doesn't make any sense without the setting.</blockquote>The setting inspiring a broad scope of thought, and the game magnifying some emotional/ethical dilemma within that scope ...

No exceptions.*\n<blockquote>How little will fail to support the players?</blockquote>\nYou need to make it clear what the central activity is, and how the setting aspects feed into that. Cover those bases and you're golden, fail to do that and all the words in the world are too little. Any setting information which is not immediately relevant to some aspect of the central activity should be cut, as it's not doing any good anyway.\n<blockquote>- What are the tricks and tools available to us as designers? How do we write our settings? How do we organize the elements of the setting? What are the different kinds of setting-elements we have at our disposal?</blockquote>\nLike prose, show, don't tell. Don't say 'Some Valerians have overcome their natural xenophobia in private', have a quote from a Valerian saying "We're not all ogres, you know. We may not be able to acknowledge you in public, but behind closed doors many of us are working to improve things".<br/><br/>If it's not direct speech, use bullet points where possible. It forces you to be brief and concentrate on the meat of each concept.<br/><br/>Organise so that details you might need in a hurry- names and so on- are clearly presented together. Stuff that sets tone or atmosphere can be tucked away as it won't need to be referred to.\n<blockquote>- How do we get players to use our setting?  How do we present it?</blockquote>\nIf the text is brief enough, they can read it in a couple of minutes and get a basic grasp on it without any difficulty. If the setting takes too long to internalise, it's a bad setting.\n<blockquote>What is the relationship between setting and method (system, rules, mecanics)?</blockquote>\nIf you can slip so much as a postcard between them, something is wrong. The setting fluff often suggests what the likely outcomes of a situation are; the mechanics should give a way of determining which of those outcomes happens. All too often, the mechanics also allow a lot of crappy, whiffle-filled, boring outcomes that run contrary to the fluff.<br/><br/><br/>*OK, I'm prepared to make exceptions for licensed games, because you can assume familiarity with the minutiae for some of the players but not all, so it's necessary to know what is canonical in the game and be able to bootstrap those who don't know the source material as well. Similarly, games that key off a particular historical milieu (or fictionalised version of) can need a little more detail. Also, some games manage to overcome the excessive fluff problem by being insanely cool anyway, but I contend that even in those cases they would be objectively better games if the fluff was reigned in somewhat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312601/#Comment_312601" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T02:57:28+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  2:57AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a big difference between setting for publication and setting for play. My setting material for running a game in Paris in 1936 was some old postcards, a small map of the catacombs and a sketch by a local artist. I filled in the rest from memory of modern Paris and what history I'd read.<br/><br/>However, when writing the same for publication, it became quickly apparent that most of the setting material was me and I had to find a way to distill that without being restrictive. And that's just for one scenario. If we're talking campaign material then you have to cast your net much wider in a publication and provide for people who start with a blank sheet. It's quite an art to draw people in on that and many setting fail to do so (for me) by giving too much information, or at least, by not classifying the information in a way that shows me what's the essential essence of the setting and what's information that might be useful in particular circumstances.<br/><br/>So, for example, in Paris in 1936, I won't tell you exactly where you can find a bar (on every street corner I expect) but I will tell about the ones where the existentialists and artists hang out.

I will primarily speak of games with a central GM role, as GM-less games tend to differ.   <br/><br/>The GM can benefit from more detailed reference information including some historical events, some important places and some themes that are of import.   The GM is looking for data and story hooks in most games so as to drive the action forward in a direction that suits the player characters.  The key here is that, assuming no other reference text, all of the necessary data should be here.   This doesn't have to be in the form of 200 pages of fiction, but I think that providing some info can be useful to many GM's.<br/><br/>By contrast, players benefit from brief texts which impart the mood of the setting, the basic setting assumptions and a good view of the bigger picture.  A few bullet points worth of key facts, some key character concepts, examples of typical social groups and a few of the key conflicts in the setting are ideal for the player's use.   The player just needs enough inspiration to spur them in a general direction in the creation of their character, while the GM should have a rough idea of how much is in that direction. <br/><br/>I think that, for me, the essential purpose of the setting is to focus the character concepts and ensure that all of the PC\u2019s are playing the same essential game.  Once that is done, the GM can drive the game based on the character concepts.   If you have completely divergent characters without setting-fostered thematic links, it will be very hard to encourage a strong, compelling and inclusive narrative in my experience.        <br/><br/>The amount of setting presented varies as well based on the length of play.   A one-shot game can focus entirely on a single situation, such as \u201coverthrowing your Evil Master\u201d and need not include 30 pages of detail of eastern European politics and folklore.    Conversely, if you are running a long-term (30+ session) game consisting of the ascension of downtrodden peasants to eastern European warlords you may benefit greatly from that quantity of setting information. <br/><br/>Sorry, I am a bit of a setting junkie and I am very happy to yammer on at length about setting creation and documentation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312617/#Comment_312617" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T06:54:38+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  6:54AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When considering the volume of information one puts into setting, consider this, also: The players are visitors to the fictional setting but the characters they play reside there.

So as a designer you need to address your audience, to have them adopt your vision for the game as their own. In a classical game, with a GM, you need to address the GM as one audience. And then you need to address the players, as another audience, possibly through the GM (giving the GM info on how to present the game). I do believe you are right, Jason; the players need more poignant information, and something that drags them into actual game-play as effective as possible.

Make tools to ease information-delivery or information-creation in game-play!<br/><br/>Part of that is also establishing definite links between character and setting, I've seen any number of PCs with elaborate back-stories that don't actually tie into any part of the game world in depth. For both info-delivery and info-creation making those links explicit is handy. The latter requires you to tailor your character so that parts of the setting intrude onto it, the latter lets you create character, setting and link all in one go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312623/#Comment_312623" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T07:18:19+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  7:18AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Is the game selling its setting in other ways too, or is this it?</blockquote>\nThis is one of the initiatory lifepaths for a Conan-esque setting.

None exactly agree what the ruins in the sewers exactly tell us.<br/><br/>In Waterdeep the lords are all masked, so they can't be bribed.

The old days of lords and dukes are fading and knights are left without a banner to rally to.  The latest race or species to arrive is driven into poverty and treated like second-class citizens.

It is perfectly fine to have a game in which the setting is "a darkened boxing arena, after midnight" and no further information about what year, country or planet it is.  That produces one feel.  It is also perfectly fine to have a game in which the setting is detailed in 6 movies, 100 tie-in novels and a stack of sourcebooks as tall as I am.  That produces another feel. Everything has to do with the goal of the group.  This is why Forgotten Realms enthusiasts like myself giggle when people say "it's too detailed!" That's the whole reason we like it. <br/><br/>Moby Dick didn't put all that shit in about whaling for no reason. It was very important material. It added to the novel.<br/><br/>And all that stuff in the Scarlet Letter about what the town looked like?<br/><br/>And how about Les Miserables, in which Hugo might stop for a couple of chapters and talk about some social problem or historical event?<br/><br/>It's a modern conceit that setting should not be detailed outside the situation.

So whatever it is, the level of detail isn't the deciding factor in whether the setting is any good or not.</blockquote>\nWord. The notion that there is a proper volume of setting material, against which we can measure what's "too little" or "too much" has probably never had to submit RPG material to outside playtesting or had a product scrutinized by a forum full of readers and/or players. One group's desert of information is another's playground. One player's smothering level of detail is another's cherished armory.<br/><br/>Thus is the skill of building and paring down a setting something that individual groups should have in their repertoire, so that they may expand what they love and cut away what they do not need. <br/><br/>Making a setting into discrete components that are easy to assemble, reassemble, and disassemble is one fine service that can be done for RPG players, but even that is an artistic choice with its own uncertainties\u2014some of the audience rebels at modular world design as feeling artificial or unfinished or whatever else. And I'm not sure that they're wrong. Sometimes I want a tightly woven, interrelated social fabric that informs every aspect of every story and from which no character can escape. Sometimes I want to be able to drop the whole Empire of Xim out of my campaign altogether with one sentence or flick of my pen.<br/><br/>Now, knowing that I sometimes seek different satisfactions from different settings, different stories, and different products from within the same setting... someone build me a functional setting.

Not a very successful one, but unless you like detailed settings, this is not the game for you.<br/>Exhibit B: I like running CoC in historical settings, with as much period detail as possible. For me, Lovecraftian horror works best if you feel like you're playing in the real world. Playing in some "alternate universe" is no fun.<br/><br/>I agree with what's been said about depth. Sure, for a pick-up game that's reliable fun, just enough background is great. But there are many pleasures of roleplaying, and I like some of the stuff that can't be done that way. So I worry about how many men were in a Victorian army battalion, how to get hold of a ship's manifest in 1924, and what the state of London streets was like in 1771, because I think it's important to get this stuff right. Others have different tastes, and that's fine with me.<br/><br/>I agree with Jason that tastes in this matter vary widely, but I also agree with Tomas that that doesn't mean nothing useful can be said about it, just because there isn't a One True Way. Maybe the difference partly lies in where play has its resonance? If you want play to resonate with universals of the human condition, then too much setting detail will detract from that. If you're more interested in the interaction between individuals and their environment, then that environment has to be shown and felt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312742/#Comment_312742" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T15:46:31+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  3:46PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- How much setting is too much?</blockquote>\nThe central activity of tenet of the game should get up to 4 pages, to make it clear what the characters do and why. Every other aspect should get no more than a single paragraph. No exceptions.*<br/><br/>*OK, I'm prepared to make exceptions for licensed games, because you can assume familiarity with the minutiae for some of the players but not all, so it's necessary to know what is canonical in the game and be able to bootstrap those who don't know the source material as well. Similarly, games that key off a particular historical milieu (or fictionalised version of) can need a little more detail. Also, some games manage to overcome the excessive fluff problem by being insanely cool anyway, but I contend that even in those cases they would be objectively better games if the fluff was reigned in somewhat.<br/><br/>Heh. Weird. I mean, I realise that hyperbole is at play here and all that, but the two footnoted examples seem to me to be the cases where <i>less</i> setting material is called for, not <i>more</i>.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that any game where the setting can't be summed up in a 25-word pitch has a big problem. Expecting players to familiarise themselves with the setting before play is unlikely to work. So publish as much supplemental material to support the GM as you want, but in terms of the core setting - well, actually 4 pages possibly isn't such a bad idea.

Although the fiction is inspired by the setting-elements in the book, it is something more than, and apart from, the <i>setting</i>.<br/><br/>So I would say it like this:<br/><i>Imagine encounters with clear choices and character actions with clear consequences. These characters are given life by working through the dilemmas of the the game, and while coming to life they work to create a fictional universe in the mind of the players. The fiction thus created spring forth from the setting of the game, the shared interaction, and the imagination of each individual player.</i><br/><br/>But apart from the wording, I am totally with you on this, David.

Having one player with markedly less setting nous often makes them reluctant to participate fully, in case they say or do something wrong. Having one player with markedly more than the rest can lead to them contradicting the GM's plot, trying to rely on knowledge other players don't have and so on. Naturally, this can be fixed by constructive play and being aware of any setting differences, but it exists as a potential problem.<br/><br/>If you're writing your own setting, you have the freedom to say 'screw that' and keep the setting as thin and flexible as possible (smothered in theme and awesome, of course), this avoiding these sorts of problems more-or-less completely.<br/><br/>If you inherit a licensed or historical setting, you can't help the fact that the information already exists. So as your hands are tied on that score, and you might as well include a fair smattering of info to help bridge any gaps.<br/><br/>The critical thing about a 'good' setting in this respect is minimising the effort to become familiar with the setting. Licensed and/or historical games usually attract people who already have an interest, so some effort in bootstrapping the newbies of the group into the setting is useful.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>Personally, I think that any game where the setting can't be summed up in a 25-word pitch has a big problem.

Because of this campaign on the Sword Coast, I have gathered together a bunch of the books via e-bay action and taken a look over them, see what interests me.  The initial books are really fun, thing AD&amp;D pamphlets that hint at things and give odd details.  The gray box itself along with Waterdeep and the North would probably have been my preferred level of detail.<br/><br/>I found the 3.0 version of the Realms to be a beautiful book with stunning art, beautiful maps but the Sword Coast seemed to have lost some of its Deadwoodish charm somehow.  I really like the AD&amp;D first edition stuff better.  The past is inferred but not detailed.  The novels and short stories and modules have not happened yet. <br/><br/>I tried the Volo's guides and found them to not only define too much but the definitions were often kind of boring.  But there are gems hidden in the straw.  My buddy, Pete is great and unearthing things like, "They say that every time a spell in cast in Faerun, another grain of sand is put in the desert of Auroch."  He unearths this shit in the Greyhawk books too, amazing details that show the world to be filled with adventure and dazzle but when I read the Greyhawk books over, I'm bored as shit until he puts on his fictagrapher archeologist helmet and shows me things.<br/><br/>I'd rather not wade through it.

Is there any advice that can unlock such skills in a group?<br/><br/>Absolutely. My thinking of late, though, is that such skills are best communicated laterally, from group to group or player (including GM) to player (including GM).

Less assertive, certainly. <br/><br/>It's possible that the very best way to teach this skill is to show off actual-play accounts or short examples of one's actual-play settings, demonstrating how <i>Vampire</i> works with just clans instead of political bodies or how <i>D&amp;D</i> works if you renovate alignments or how <i>Dark Sun</i> operates if you swap out city-states. <br/><br/>The best way to gain XP in this area is to meddle, to get in there and mess with things and see if it satisfies your players. (The strength and power of the play-group scale of RPGs is that any game can be altered to suit the immediate audience without having to give two damns about whether the median fan of the game would agree with your choices.)

Even sprawling, overwhelming settings can be <i>introduced</i> in short, punchy text in the hands of great writers, right? There's a difference between a 25-word elevator pitch and a summary. There's a difference between a well-aimed introduction and a summary.<br/><br/>Appealing settings attract an audience with a great introduction and draw people (developers or readers or whatever) deeper and deeper into the setting\u2014sometimes past or <i>through</i> information that might otherwise seem dull\u2014with layers of enticing sights, satisfying or curious details, etc. etc. <br/><br/>The opening crawl text of <i>Star Wars</i> is an introduction that doesn't exactly summarize, for example. Middle-earth is a reasonably popular setting, you might say, and it's sprawling mass of details is part of the appeal for a great deal of readers. <br/><br/>Summarizing a setting is no substitute for the <i>experience</i> of that setting. I don't believe a summary is a true measure of a setting's artfulness or functionality or success. I've never once come out of a genre film or novel and said, "Ahh, that was great! The setting was really easily summarized!" It's just not where the magic lies for me.<br/><br/>More to the point, though, the ability to introduce a setting, to boil it down to something that appeals and attracts people into the richer experience, is a different skill from the one that develops the larger world. They're related, they're both important, and some people have both skill sets, but it's like saying that you can't create a functional world if you can't also market it effectively. I think marketing is important to success, but marketing alone\u2014getting players or readers or writers in the door\u2014doesn't sate.<br/><br/>My opinion, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312847/#Comment_312847" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T09:22:37+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  9:22AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/><br/>And by that you refer to the inspirations of the designer(s); what got him/her/them started on the game in the first place; the things driving designers towards a shared vision of inspired game-play ... ?<br/><br/>What I like to call "feed".

Maybe you could share with us "illiterates" (the ones which have not read BW) some of the tools/tricks/advise served up for the players in that Burner, Judd, and your thoughts on some of those tools now?</blockquote>\nTomas, by inspiration I just mean the items that inspired the setting, things that could be short-hand for folks.  <br/><br/>If Vincent says to me, "The setting in Dogs in the Vineyard is kind of like pre-statehood Utah," I wouldn't have known what that meant but the setting as presented in Dogs in the Vineyard does a nice job of invoking that by describing the landscape, what the traditional gender roles are and how things would work if the world was perfect and simple (but its not).  <br/><br/>Sometimes that shorthand can be really helpful and bring the right people to the book/setting/game, people who would appreciate it and not only read the vision on the page but bring their own visions to the table.<br/><br/>Sorry I wasn't clear about the Adventure Burner.  The AdBu is the last book in the Burning Wheel line and a kind of how-to or best practices book for using BW.  It breaks down world-building for a BW game down into <b>Characters</b> (PC's and NPC's), <b>Setting</b> (Geography, Culture, Cool Details, etc.), <b>Situation</b> (A problem in the setting that isn't easily solved, the imbalance that drives the campaign), <b>Action</b> (the bit that is in your face right now, a problem that will drive the first session).  <br/><br/>I feel like those are the tools that I have used on instinct my whole gaming life.  I was on the Adventure Burner's development team and we kind of beat our heads against our keyboards trying to figure out what the hell we were doing to make our BW campaigns work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312857/#Comment_312857" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T09:44:55+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  9:44AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2011 9:49AM by komradebob.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>The setting is generally acknowledged as a central element of the games we play. Some games make without it, or; they let the players make it. But most games are sold with a setting. The setting normally works as a framework for the identity and actions of the characters, from which the fiction (narrative, drama) spring forth.<br/><br/>The above is only to give some basis for a discussion on how we make such settings functional.<br/><br/><b>Here's my questions:</b><br/><br/>- What are the tricks and tools available to us as designers? How do we write our settings? How do we organize the elements of the setting? What are the different kinds of setting-elements we have at our disposal?<br/><br/>- How do we get players to use our setting? How do we present it? What is the relationship between setting and method (system, rules, mecanics)? How do the characters fit into the picture?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI'm thinking a lot about this right now, especially with something I'm working on as a personal project ( The Transylvania setting Braunstein over in Praxis).<br/><br/>So, at least regarding "How do we present it?", my answer falls, at least for that project, under "Visual Art taking primacy over writing in terms of presentation to the players".<br/><br/>Depending on the setting ( or situation, for games where that is the more important and familiar draw item), a lot can be conveyed in writing in a single page or two.<br/><br/>But visual art? That's a big deal. I was drawn to Jorune, not by any setting write up or rules, but by the Teves art ( iirc!). Bradstreet's art alone gave me a great vision of what the world of VtM was like and about.<br/><br/>D&amp;D would be an awfully different kind of game if it was presented with a single artist's art. Imagine an all Erol Otus art edition, or all Frazetta, or all Brian Froud.<br/><br/>For my own project, the physical minis and stuff matters. First there's the core set of miniature figures that form the "cast" available; They're all civilian types you'd see having about a small village centered around an inn in Hollywood monster haunted Transylvania, not your standard even skirmish wargame type thing.<br/><br/>Second, there's how I build the terrain and what I build. The core of this project to start is going to be the inn itself, and a couple of related village buildings. Standard wargaming approaches go out the window. Scale for example. I'm going to use a more toy playmat mentality in my layout than a measure and move and 1"= blahblahblah feet.<br/><br/>[Playmats are basically a big sheet of terrain made by toy comapnies for their toys. They play all kinds of hinky with scale, concentrating on locations relevent to their toys. Look up "schleich playmat" in google images to see what I'm talking about"]<br/><br/>It's also going to be conveyed in the fashion I expand those collections of stuff, and the way I design them, including the colors I use and the decorations.<br/><br/>How does that impact the player understanding of the setting? Well, it says right of that this isn't a standard miniatures wargame, even if we're using miniatures. It also says use the stuff available as inspiration for play.<br/><br/>How does it impact techniques and mechanics? Well, the setting write up will probably be literally a page at most. These are the adventures of a bunch of everyday people who happen to lie at the edge of scary Hollywood Transylvania. The style is that of a bar centered comedy, a bit like Cheers or Allo, Allo.<br/><br/>In other terms of presentation, there will probably be a page or two at most about player level activities that make the thing run. Advice about using charater-level secrets openly by the players for example, or opening and closing scenes. Things normally thought of as mechanics (by your formulation Tomas) will likely be extremely brief, like a page long or less, and titled "Tooks" in any sort of player handout. <br/><br/>So, that's my take: Simple setting set up, lots of art of an interpretable/expandable sort but that has distinct flavor.<br/><br/>Edit: D'oh!

Good world-building happens throughout the storytelling, for sure. I took it as understood that <i>Star Wars</i>, for example, continues to build and convey its world after the crawl\u2014but that wasn't exactly on point with what I'm saying about the role of the summary, as the unfolding of the story is analogous to actual play rather than background.<br/><br/>Background loads us up with imagery before the story unfolds, so we can form mental images faster or underscore those images in different ways during play, in a way that an introduction or summary do not. If I had to stop and describe every piece of information that we get about the setting in the first few minutes of <i>Star Wars</i>, it would take considerably longer to unfold through actual play. It's one thing for an audience to hear "Imperial Senate," for example, and infer or ignore in the case of the larger story. It's another thing to write that line of dialogue or be inside the head of the character saying it and want to understand what's at stake and how to make gameplay choices in a world that's barely understood. <br/><br/>I was wary of bringing out the <i>Star Wars</i> reference at all, of course, lest we fall into too close a reading or too tangled a metaphor.<br/><br/>Yes, the visuals convey tons\u2014but they were not decided on the fly in the telling by a committee of players. They were designed and refined and specifically cultivated to convey what they convey as simply and dramatically as possible. The visual catalog of <i>Star Wars</i>'s setting and background isn't conveyed in a 25-word summary.<br/><br/>As a reminder, this isn't to say that spare or minimalist settings cannot work in the RPG medium the way they can in, say, theater or film. (The darkened boxing ring after midnight is a fine example.) They absolutely can work\u2014I've got a game in development that counts on it\u2014and the creation of setting details on the fly can be terrific fun and wonderfully evocative.<br/><br/>My point is that there is not necessarily one true way, and the effectiveness of artful introductions or easily summarized settings are evidence of a skill that is related to, but not the same as, setting creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312874/#Comment_312874" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T10:46:04+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 10:46AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey JDCorley:<br/><br/>I recall an old thread where you talked about taking a big old setting, then chopping it back to focussing on a few key interesting things for practical play.

I wish I'd thought to bring it up here! I think it's totally relevant.<br/><br/>Access is an important part of a setting. Call it an entry point, call it the new-player experience, call it something else, the vector by which we enter a setting is an important part of setting design. It's where I think that 25-word introduction really <i>is</i> valuable, if it's grabby and inviting and captivating and draws you in.<br/><br/>Introducing a setting through stages or carefully crafted steps is one wonderful method. For Harry Potter's world this is especially fitting because you start off with our muggle world and then explore deeper and deeper into the wizarding world.<br/><br/><i>The Matrix</i> lets us in on some of the new rules of the fictional setting early on, not just by showing us what Trinity is capable of but by showing us the reactions of the police officers, who say, "That's impossible..." Now we have a sense of both what's considered normal and what's actually possible. More rules are revealed over time.<br/><br/>In a way, even <i>Star Wars</i> does this, first by orienting the fictional world as a fairy tale, relative to us in the audience ("A long time ago..."), and then by easing us in with the intro text, and then by dropping us into a telling visual with an immediate conflict. <br/><br/>Sometimes we see the steps into the world juggled into different orders, in which we start inside the fictional world, with some kind of action sequence already in progress, and then back out to the familiar. See again <i>The Matrix</i>, in which we are given this little snapshot of what's possible in the world, and then back out to the normalcy of Mr. Anderson's life, and then gradually submerge into the truth and premise of the larger setting.<br/><br/>There are great examples in RPG book design and organization, too, in which readers are able to take in the large-scale scope of the setting\u2014browsing advanced powers and foes, maybe\u2014even if they're going to start with a limited suite of power(s). The new Red Box does this, as I understand it, by giving the new player accessible, immediate questions to answer and then revealing more and more of the game and the attached setting as it goes along.<br/><br/>But I want to point out that Harry Potter's world <i>isn't</i> simple or gestural or sketched out. It's incredibly detailed. It's just presented in a way that makes it easy to enter from the outside, to enjoy and yet, still, ultimately get lost in. It's also an example of a setting that happily overwhelms and seems to sprawl and persist outside of an immediate situation.<br/><br/><i>Edit:</i> Though, of course, it's overarching story is sort of a persist situation, isn't it? That runs through the whole heart of the series?

I don't believe a summary is a true measure of a setting's artfulness or functionality or success. I've never once come out of a genre film or novel and said, "Ahh, that was great! The setting was really easily summarized!" It's just not where the magic lies for me.<br/><br/>More to the point, though, the ability to introduce a setting, to boil it down to something that appeals and attracts people into the richer experience, is a different skill from the one that develops the larger world.

I think marketing is important to success, but marketing alone\u2014getting players or readers or writers in the door\u2014doesn't sate.<br/><br/>My opinion, anyway.</blockquote>\nI think you're right, Will. My point was just that I feel that too much of a requirement for pre-game reading is always going to be a barrier to entry. Some games (and other stories) get around this by making the first story be one of the protagonist's introduction in to the fantasy world (e.g. <i>The Matrix</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i>, as mentioned up thread, and in gaming there's <i>Empire of the Petal Throne. Jorune</i> tries this approach but is not entirely successful).<br/><br/>The bias I'm bringing here is that I think, in order to maintain a functional shared imagined space, it is necessary for the GM to be able to describe locations and characters with a certain economy of narrative. If I'm running a 50s Noir game, I can say "a couple of suited goons with tommy guns kick in the door to the cheap motel where you're staying" and be confident that everyone is picturing more-or-less the same thing. If I'm running a session of <i>Skyrealms of Jorune</i>, however, the first time "a couple of muadra dyte punks use a dysha to blow open the door to the cheap room in the yurt where you're staying", I'm probably going to have to spend 15 minutes explaining the scene. Even the second or third time it happens, it would probably need a detailed explanation if I want to ensure that the player's picture of these things matches mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_313001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313001/#Comment_313001" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T02:32:31+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  2:32AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 2:35AM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>"a couple of suited goons with tommy guns kick in the door to the cheap motel where you're staying" <br/>...<br/> "a couple of muadra dyte punks use a dysha to blow open the door to the cheap room in the yurt where you're staying"</blockquote>LOL<br/><br/>A certain economy of narrative will help entice your readers, or players.

It's not a question of summarising, it's a question of brewing up a concise, potent source of inspiration instead of a large body of descriptive (and prescriptive) detail. The trick, I think, is in brutally excising the details that aren't curious, the sights that are ordinary, and the minutiae that aren't chock-a-block with potential. What you're left with, then, is that 4 pages of gold.<br/><br/>The magic, for me, is the process of making stuff up on the fly- player or GM- and running with other people's ideas. The most memorable parts of games I've been in are almost always where an aside or throwaway remark has gone on to become a major element of what's gone on later. Something that encourages players to defer to a set text instead of opting for whichever choice is most dramatic and/or entertaining at that point takes some of the magic away for me.<br/><br/>I think it was in a gameplaywright blog post a while ago- the book of matches. In my experience players are more reluctant to start sloshing petrol around the place when the setting is particularly detailed.

I also think that the RPG where "the author has complete control over the setting" is an illusory foe. Point me at such an RPG. Show me the one in which the author\u2014of the RPG book, I'm assuming\u2014has the power to come in and disqualify your play. <br><br>Yes, the weight of pre-defined setting material can be an overwhelming mire for some groups, and it can appear to be immutable, but that's an illusion. Each gaming group ultimately decides how much of the influential material to allow into the group's specific instance of the game world. See, for example, the groups talking at RPGnet about basing their <i>Star Wars</i> RPG adventures on just the galaxy suggested by the original film. On the one hand, they are excising huge swaths of a larger setting, yet on the other hand, if they want to, one of them can say "Bespin" and, like it was a magic word, invoke a catalog of imagery and shared reference even as they refine or redefine what Bespin is in the context of their instance of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Part of the situation, here, is that I'm thinking in part about the difference between settings for sale and settings just for play. Volumes can be conveyed at the game table by saying, "they're like Klingons, except they're fish people" or "it's Battlestar Galactica meets Grimm's fairy tales." That is <i>one</i> viable way to evoke setting and get the process of in-play creation going. <br/><br/>The game that's for sale, though, may have to (or want to\u2014it's a fair artistic choice) take the longer way around to create the new touchstones that the gaming group will use to say, "It's an Ixnam colony world on an ice planet" in a way that draws imaginations together even as it suggests and inspires new possibilities. It's sometimes enough to get across the gist of an Ixnam colony world in one paragraph\u2014and I have a big appreciation for lean, gestural world-building that inspires as much or more than it nails down\u2014but going into more detail gives some groups better ammunition for quickly conveying ideas at the table. <br/><br/>My argument is merely that richly detailed worlds have their place right alongside sketched-out settings. It's a spectrum, with viable artistic and creative choices available from end to end.<br/><br/>I love building worlds through play, in reaction to and in support of the stories than unfold that way, but I also sometimes love revealing aspects of a detailed and breathing world that I've invented, like a beloved PC of my own. There's room for both.<br/><br/>Looking back at your quote, I'll put it another way: I don't think detailing a world is at odds with making it hook-heavy or brimming with ideas. A <i>great</i> setting is both lived-in and lush <i>and</i> rich with hooks and ideas.<br/><br/>Now, what happens as a setting ages and gets overcrowded and begins to fill up with canon... that's something else.<br/><br/><i>Edit: </i> I'm pretty much repeating myself now, aren't I?

The OP wants to know how to build a functional setting.   The level of detail, as has probably been discussed is more about where the game is coming from than a hard rule.  Lots of games have the setting as a major focus, so of course there is going to be detail there.  Think of Glorantha - the fun of playing Runequest was being in the setting.  for other games, the setting is not such a big deal so its necessarily going to be light on for detail.<br/><br/>Where I think the distinction needs to be made is in how you present the setting, no matter the level of detail.   The detail you present should be in terms of concepts rather than facts.  Make the detail rubbery: open to interpretation, extension and extrapolation.  Its the concepts which capture the imagination, not facts.  Facts are facts and once established thats it -- nothing more for the players to do with them.  Present the players with a concept and they can fire up, take the ball and run with it themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313083/#Comment_313083" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T14:41:15+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  2:41PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Is setting the game in the real world, or a historical version of the real world, where there is literally infinite detail, an impediment, or a flaw that needs to be worked around, or might it be a benefit to certain groups and games?</blockquote>\nIt can be an impediment, in the same way as it can be for any setting. It can also be worked around, if you remember to chuck out anything that doesn't fit your needs, also like any setting. And, of course, you can use it to your advantage as well. The real world is often much less of a barrier to entry; unless it's a little-used historical period or a highly unusual location, so you can comfortably rely on more player knowledge, and need less setting detail anyway.<br/><br/>From the point of view of the writer, your hands are tied. You can't make the design decision to clothe your world scantily because it's already stood there in a duffel coat. You're stuck with it whether you like it or not.

It sort of flies in the face of RPG product-development history, but I'm not saying that it's wrong. I'll want to think about that a lot more.<br/><br/>Regardless, I don't think that a lack of confidence or experience in some groups makes designs for them superior. I think empowering or teaching groups to use or discard or create setting elements trumps all of this. I don't think we have to avoid detailed settings just because some groups don't know how to get the best mileage out of them.<br/><br/>I've known plenty of players who don't want to have to invent their own settings or setting elements, no matter how fun it is for you and I. They don't want to build the world as they play, they just want to play in it. They don't want to be put on the spot. They deserve settings to play in, too.\n<blockquote>So I'd directly contradict 'A great setting is both lived-in and lush and rich with hooks and ideas'. That's a<i>good</i>setting. A<i>great</i>setting doesn't need to be fully populated with detail and history, because the hooks suggest enough of both to fill that purpose just as well.</blockquote>\nI'm not talking about "fully populated" settings, necessarily. Good game maps need blank spaces, fun sandboxes need room to build. But I suspect that if you showed me a hook that suggests enough detail and history to "fill that purpose just as well" (as what?\u2014I'm sketchy on what you mean, there), I would call it more than a hook. I would say it combined a hook with setting elements to add detail to the setting. So maybe we just use these terms in different ways.<br/><br/>We may be arguing across definitions of functionality, here, too. I'm talking about world-building that includes RPGs, but is not just for RPGs. (I've been using transmedia examples on purpose.) To me, a great setting can permeate and thrive across multiple platforms. A setting that's great just for RPGs (or just for novels, or just for a video game, or whatever) doesn't need to serve the same masters.<br/><br/>By your argument, it sounds like you'd put great RPG settings at odds with great transmedia settings. So let me ask you: <b>As a setting is populated over time by stories and characters, does that setting become less apt for RPG play?</b> It's a matter of opinion, of course, and I'm curious to get more opinions into my repertoire. <br/><br/>From where I'm standing, though, Ben, it sounds like your argument is that RPGs are best served by a smaller selection of settings\u2014I'm arguing for a higher-tolerance array of settings\u2014but do I have it right? That strikes me as being at odds with the inherent flexibility of RPGs. I think that both <i>Star Wars</i>-style and <i>Lady Blackbird</i>-style worlds are equally legitimate stylistic choices for RPG play. <br/><br/>(<i>Edit:</i> I've cut a section here on information-delivery and presentation because this post is too damn long already.)<br/><br/>I promise I'll stop beating this horse soon.

How little will fail to support the players?</i><br/><br/>Setting is too much when it fails to inspire the players.  There's a fine line between creative constraints and hemmed in by too much setting.<br/><br/>Too little setting gives players nothing to riff off of, feeling adrift and very often with intense pressure to create something cool without any kind of foundation.<br/><br/><i>- What are the tricks and tools available to us as designers? How do we write our settings? How do we organize the elements of the setting? What are the different kinds of setting-elements we have at our disposal?</i><br/><br/>Tricks and tools, like: embedding the setting into the mechanics and character creation (thinking of BW here), giving an outline of what the setting looks and feels like so that the GM can create bits of the setting on their own (thinking of Dogs in the Vineyard here), putting the setting together as an in-game document with incomplete snippets from the game world so that the players only need to read an entry or two to get the basic idea of the setting (thinking of Dictionary of Mu here, tooting my own tome).<br/><br/><i>- How do we get players to use our setting? How do we present it? What is the relationship between setting and method (system, rules, mecanics)? How do the characters fit into the picture?</i><br/><br/>Hopefully, we don't get them to use the setting but in its presentation and through play it is just unavoidable.  The bits presented get the players hungry and inspired to dwell there for a while and make up their own shit to add to it.

How do you "reboot" a setting at the start of a new campaign? I've played again and again in the same settings, and have found three solutions to this. I expect them to be quite general.<br/><br/><b>1 - You start anew, ignoring old campaigns</b><br/>- Good: you can use all the setting-material as is<br/>- Bad: the players have left no mark on "the world" of the setting<br/><br/><b>2 - You incorporate old campaigns in the setting, before starting a new one</b><br/>- Good: players love to explore the consequences left by former characters<br/>- Bad: making adjustments to the setting is demanding work<br/><br/><b>3 - You use bits from old sessions which are easy to incorporate, and toss the rest</b><br/>- Good: easy to start, players may find their own "footmarks"<br/>- Bad: players may find it weird that some stuff never happened, when other stuff clearly did                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_313094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313094/#Comment_313094" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T15:18:20+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  3:18PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 3:19PM by TomasHVM.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>The relationship between system and setting feels like a poorly worded question.

I'm trying to say that they're not for anyone, in particular, just that less experienced groups don't necessarily have the courage to throw out what's not working or getting in the way.<br/><br/>I used to think it was self-evident that a well-fleshed out setting was better, but as time has gone by and I've played more games, and strayed away from the big ticket RPG lines, I've come to opposite conclusion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>I've known plenty of players who don't want to have to invent their own settings or setting elements, no matter how fun it is for you and I. They don't want to build the world as they play, they just want to play in it. They don't want to be put on the spot.</blockquote>That's the crux of my argument, though- a well-crafted brief setting gives such a group everything they need to get cracking, without unnecessarily constraining groups who want more freedom to improvise. Have setting elements there, but presented minimally. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>By your argument, it sounds like you'd put great RPG settings at odds with great transmedia settings.</blockquote>I've already said that in pre-existing settings, you don't have a lot of choice because you can't pretend the material isn't there. If it exists, you need to supply it to make sure that newcomers to the franchise can get up to speed with fans. I'm specifically talking about games where the author has a free reign to create the setting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>But I suspect that if you showed me a hook that suggests enough detail and history to "fill that purpose just as well" (as what?\u2014I'm sketchy on what you mean, there), I would call it more than a hook.</blockquote>A few quick examples (it's late here):<br/>- Count Varsigan doesn't look his eighty years.<br/>- The bridge across the river was washed out last winter.<br/>- "Never trust one o' them red-haired folk- they steal babbies put curses on cattle."<br/><br/>You don't need a list of possible reasons for Varsigan's seeming youth. You don't need to explain just how bad the flood was and how many lives were lost. You don't need to give a full account of how gingers have been persecuted in a particular town- you can get the meat and the usable plot elements with only a single sentence.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>As a setting is populated over time by stories and characters, does that setting become less apt for RPG play?</blockquote>For that group of players and characters, no. It';s been populated by what works, and everyone lived through the created details. For a different group of players, yes. Even if some of the players (including the GM) are the same, push the big red reset button. You can always fold the best ideas back in if they still fit.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>From where I'm standing, though, Ben, it sounds like your argument is that RPGs are best served by a smaller selection of settings</blockquote>I'd say let a billion settings bloom, but make each one a gem rather than a boulder.<br/><br/>I'm possible using a little too much hyperbole here, but I think it's a serious point. I'd say something like 90% of RPGs I've read are too verbose in their setting detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313096/#Comment_313096" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T15:30:48+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  3:30PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Hindmarch</cite>By your argument, it sounds like you'd put great RPG settings at odds with great transmedia settings.

I haven't seen it done yet in a way that interests me or feels like it exists to enhance or compliment the gaming going on at our table.  It could be really interesting seeing a story with characters having to struggle with similar issues and questions that come up at the gaming table but there is often a departure, a place where the gaming kicks the world in the teeth and the novel(s)-set-in-the-gameworld blows up the moon and then we go our different ways.<br/><br/>But sales of Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance novels/short story collections/setting books state that lots and lots of people disagree with my sorry ass.<br/><br/>So, there's that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313097/#Comment_313097" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T15:45:08+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  3:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>But sales of Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance novels/short story collections/setting books state that lots and lots of people disagree with my sorry ass.</blockquote>\nNo, I mean, it certainly conclusively disproves the idea that highly detailed settings are bad for gaming in some kind of general sense (highly written settings are "not for anyone"? haha lol, the entire history of the hobby called), but it doesn't mean that people who play FR or DL do so in settings that slavishly adhere to every detail of every novel. Normally that is not the case.  Certainly you can buy and enjoy a FR novel to see what some other person's take on the setting is, right? In the same way that you can be interested in other people's games in the same setting. It doesn't mean that you don't depart from it when you play. <br/><br/>In fact, the moment you make your first character for the setting, you've departed from the written material irrevocably and catastrophically. From that moment on, everything the author of the written material intended, you have completely destroyed and gotten absolutely wrong. (By the by, the same is true of minimal settings.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager

Normally that is not the case.  Certainly you can buy and enjoy a FR novel to see what some other person's take on the setting is, right? In the same way that you can be interested in other people's games in the same setting. It doesn't mean that you don't depart from it when you play.</blockquote>\nSee, for me, the issue isn't about the level of detail which exists for a setting - it's about how much of that the players need to know before they can play. So the real world is a really simple choice for a campaign - I can say to my group (as I once did) that the next campaign will be set in 17C Jamaica during the Golden Age of Piracy, and that's as much information as they need to play (because everyone's seen at least one pirate movie and so can get going). Similarly, FR and DL are close enough to "vanilla fantasy" that you can describe "an orc", "a tavern" or "a castle" without having to worry about whether everyone's picturing it right (and yes, I'm aware of the error in my examples with respect to one of those two settings).<br/><br/>The settings which are more problematic are those where the players need a lot of knowledge to get going. So things like <i>Transhuman Space, Cthulutech</i>, or <i>Skyrealms of Jorune</i>. You're making the buy-in harder for the players, which will be an issue to a greater or lesser degree depending on your group. <br/><br/>There are a number of ways around it of course. As I mentioned previously Tekumel makes this a feature, with the default first campaign being "you're a barbarian who knows nothing about Tekumel". Another example would be <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>. That's got a great clear pitch you can sell to the players - in fact the title of the game is practically a condensed version of the pitch - but it also has a lot of assumed knowledge you need to learn before play, in terms of vampire clans and politics etc. The genius of VTM, however, is that it makes all of the additional assumed knowledge part of char gen, so that by the time you're ready to sit down to play you're all up to speed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313150/#Comment_313150" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-18T01:45:21+00:00" title="February 18, 2011  1:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2011 1:45AM by Queex.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>You're making the buy-in harder for the players, which will be an issue to a greater or lesser degree depending on your group.</blockquote>I rambled at length on that a while ago- I think I linked to it from SG before, but: <a href="http://queex.livejournal.com/163480.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I think the discussion here is of a stronger statement, that even with a cheap buy-in, how much is too much setting detail? but it's an important point to make that making the game accessible is a high priority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313568/#Comment_313568" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T18:45:19+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  6:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see a huge campaign world that's built by those who play it. The sessions of play develop material and events and are reported to whoever is cataloguing all this information and adding details to the setting.<br/><br/>Each event that takes place in any player's game is added to the setting, but as "rumours" or "tales". So, yeah, if you want to know what you've heard about King X, you can look up, "What are people saying about King X in the Riverbank States?" And then you get some rumours and thoughts and information. Some of them will be completely contradictory, because people's games will all end differently. So maybe some people think King X is a kindly despot with aspirations to becoming a church leader, whereas another rumour says he is actually a bloodthirsty cannibal. In <i>your</i> version of this world, you'd just have to go meet him to find out which is true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313578/#Comment_313578" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-21T21:57:07+00:00" title="February 21, 2011  9:57PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This has already been done in global LARPs - the results are horribly dire.

I'm not party to the many developments in this kind of rpgs.<br/><br/>Yes, to talk accessibility is important. The setting need to be written well, but it has to be communicated well too, to have a positive impact on the game. And the more setting you have, the higher the challenge of communication.
