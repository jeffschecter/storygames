How?<br/><br/>There had a plethora of options that took into consideration attendees busy schedules. Including...<br/><br/>- 1 hour games that were not scheduled, run constantly on demand.<br/>- 2 hour games run on a schedule, every 2 hours at even intervals (10am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm)<br/>- 4 hour games run once per day, towards the end of the day (avoiding late attendees and giving people time to see other con events first)<br/><br/>I saw lots of young players trying RPGs for the first time. It was very cool!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
