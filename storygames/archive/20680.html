I started asking him about it, and premise-wise, it looks like a Forge-inspired "indie story game" - much of the design is essentially what Forgite designers would consider "Narrativist", down to the details:<br/><br/>* Relatively "true to life" content with a splash of the supernatural (you play a high schooler who learns to "rewind time").<br/><br/>* Deals with interpersonal issues like heartbreak, friendship, family, betrayal, suicide, and other "heavy topics" instead of physical confrontations/combat and adventure.<br/><br/>* The ability to "rewind time" means you can replay most or all of what you do in the game, by going back and then trying it again.<br/><br/>* This means that failure and success isn't really at stake: rather, you are offered consequential choices, like whether to reveal a hurtful truth to a friend. These choices then affect the lives of the other characters.<br/><br/>This is pretty interesting, and it will be fun to see what kind of audience it attracts and how much popularity it gains. Lots of parallels to certain styles of gaming from "our world", as I'm sure you can see for yourselves.<br/><br/>My friend has been playing it with his wife, and he says that they're both enjoying it a great deal but find it very emotionally draining sometimes, due to the heavy content.<br/><br/>Has anyone played it? Does the design succeed at what it's trying to do?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453951/#Comment_453951" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-18T23:25:39+00:00" title="June 18, 2016 11:25PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2016 11:26PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played it. It succeeds at what it is trying to do, I believe. It hit very big in video games when it came out. However, it doesn't appear to have made a significant dent in what AAA games are doing.  It is not changing what's popular by any means.<br/><br/>It in no way is narrativist because you don't make an Egri-style moral statement through the play of the game. (Your options are very limited and your skill at investigation is tested at several points where you may wish to make a particular moral statement but be unable to.)<br/><br/>Actually the only really narrativist game in video games right now is "the game of writing a really personalized twine game", I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453952/#Comment_453952" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-18T23:51:44+00:00" title="June 18, 2016 11:51PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting! The way my friend described it, he felt his choices had significant impact on interpersonal relationships and similar moral points. (He's not a story gamer, however.)<br/><br/>Could the game's structure be used to do such a thing, with minor changes?<br/><br/>Thanks for clarifying; it's interesting in any case. Removing the the factor of success and failure from such decisions is certainly an unusual step in game design, I feel, and somewhat interesting in terms of potential "Premise-addressing".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453953/#Comment_453953" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-19T00:41:44+00:00" title="June 19, 2016 12:41AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, there is significant impact on interpersonal relationships, but that's not narrativism. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453957/#Comment_453957" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-19T11:40:16+00:00" title="June 19, 2016 11:40AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2016 11:45AM by Rickard.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno. They focus on the fiction, but ... I dunno.<br/><br/>Here is a good Lets Play of the game:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clSoi-m1Bnw" rel="nofollow">Caiyth - Life is Strange: Classroom exploration <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a></a><br/><br/>There are a couple of games out there that focus on story. It's mostly about getting story through exploration.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/247391/Surrendering_control_and_trusting_in_players_with_Her_Story.php" rel="nofollow">Her Story</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oauh0wLMEzM" rel="nofollow">SOMA</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps_CeuQCmhg" rel="nofollow">The Walking Dead</a> (reactions to the end), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyKg7xmVIKw&amp;list=PL3tRBEVW0hiBySIHHqBen5AUm6CMoIY2J" rel="nofollow">Firewatch</a>... Especially Firewatch is close to Life is Strange, and to your requirements. The first two ones does something different though, because there the players creates their own story through interpretation of story elements given to them through exploration. It's something that is new in computer games.<br/><br/>Life is Strange, however, not so much. It's a game that focuses on story before mechanics. A linear progression too. They even erase all the previous choices after half the game so they can rail the player some more.<br/><br/>But sure, if the definition of narrativism is your list, then yeah, the game fulfills it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
