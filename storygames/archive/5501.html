I was the GM, John Stevropoulos was Emma, the wealthy and wise queen of the Frisians, Ryan Macklin was playing a wyrd named Wind Stone, Rob Bohl was playing a cruel dwarf-thane whose name I don't recall, and Bret Gillan was playing the Ancient Tree, an ambulatory and angry creatures enslaved by the dwarves.</p>\n<p>In addition, there were two NPC "heroes" vying to be king of the Frisians by wedding Emma by some method or another. The wyrd had offered to the hero who would kill the tree his enormous power. Rob's protagonist wasn't in a particular conflict \u2014\xa0his dwarf-thane didn't care about who became king \u2014 so he was playing Theomund, an errant and mighty warrior with a magic sword. I was playing Haergar, the queen's captain, owner of a magic helmet. The two were identical, mechanically. Theomund just turned out to be more of a dick. There was an implication that he'd tried to take the queen by force, which had gone very poorly for him.</p>\n<p>So the two dudes are vying with each other to kill the Tree, but we've fumbled the rules a little, because Vincent's turned stake-type conflict resolution literally inside out; these rules are all about <em>coercion</em>. So we were stumbling along a little bit. Eventually, Bret's tree dies (in negotiation, which is interesting, but wouldn't have happened if we'd been clearer on the rules). So Haergar's won the wyrd's power. Theomund looks up at him \u2014 this is in the middle of the fight, but it's clear that Theomund is going to lose \u2014 and says to Haergar (though I think it was really Rob asking me) "What about me?" I say, as Haergar, "Go fuck a pig."</p>\n<p>So, keep in mind, we're kinda fumbling the rules a bit, not entirely clear on how "stakes" work in this game (they don't). So there's a pause.</p>\n<p>Rob says to me, "So... do I have to go fuck a pig?"</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123442/#Comment_123442" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T12:32:09+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 12:32PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of that, I posted up a bit of a thought on my journal that I meant to send to you.\n<blockquote><cite>From: <a href="http://macklinr.livejournal.com/579142.html?thread=1425478#t1425478" rel="nofollow">http://macklinr.livejournal.com/579142.html?thread=1425478#t1425478</a></cite>So, in further unpacking my thoughts about the Beowulf playtest, there's something Joshua said in the premise/hack discussion that we rather went against in the game.<br/><br/>He said (paraphrasing): "In addition to injured &amp; exhausted, there's shamed, which covers the other two [forms].

I was just considering how not-closely the players hewed to the concept.</p>\n<p>There are, like, five explicitly supernatural items in that oracle. There's the dwarves and their trees, a coat of mail that whispers to its wearer, and a sword that calls for blood, a monster, and a talking animal, the King of the Forest.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of things that are implicitly supernatural. There's a ruin of a giant-home (it's unclear if there are still giants), Fate is mentioned once or twice, and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>Now, I don't mind if people are putting in lots of supernatural stuff. With the new "pregnancy" rule, it will basically mean that the hero has unusual origins. I'm totally OK with that. More than OK. Arthur has weird origins, too, with his father magically disguised as the man he's killed and seducing Arthur's eventual mother as such. Oh, and his sister's a fairy. Not to mention Siegfried, whose father died fighting Odin. So I think we're OK.</p>\n<p>Now, Theomund and Emma have a chance to make a baby. Two people who have eaten the wyrd's body to gain his power. That <em>totally</em> explains why this guy is going to be a hero. I think it's heavy-handed to say, "And the hero has to be a regular dude, except awesome."</p>\n<p>I really think we're gonna be OK. We've got a long-term Beowulf game running here (to be resumed next week), and we haven't yet had a pregnancy (though things are headed that way, natch), but we'll see how this works. We'll see if the Oracle gives us monsters, dwarves, and giants only. Honestly, I have a hard time believing that it would be a problem, even if we did.</p>\n<p>However!</p>\n<p>Will players be so seduced by the weird that they'll pull dwarves, giants, talking trees, and, heaven forfend, <em>women</em> at every opportunity? I dunno! Since the game springs from the idea that "hero" is a problematic concept, finding the borders of who qualifies is, I think, totally OK.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123497/#Comment_123497" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T14:43:41+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  2:43PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting discussion.

What is it that you're doing to inform the "heroic epic poem" idea that (I think) you're going for, other than a new set of Oracles and a "pregnancy rule"?  I'm sure I'm wrong here, but without knowing more info, it feels like the playtest was just another IAWA game (to be fair, that's only the second game I've played of IAWA, so maybe I'm off-base -- only, it felt similar to how we played our Everquest/Final Fantasy/gearpunk game the week prior).<br/><br/>To ask more directly:  What is it that will make a Beowulf game not just some ol' IAWA game, and what could be communicated to the players in the onset in order to help make that happen?<br/><br/>That last part is a leading question, because I think that something outside and before the initial Oracle draw could have helped us latch onto your concept a bit more firmly (though, Rob might have still had to question fucking a pig).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123549/#Comment_123549" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T17:56:15+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  5:56PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was asking the first question, "What about me?" in character.

It seems like your game, though, is kinda set up to be "if you play it as a one-shot, you're totally not playing it" sort of game moreso than "vanilla" IAWA reads to me.  Am I misunderstanding it?  I have only played in two, completely separate IAWA games so far (including your playtest).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I may also run it this Sunday for a different group. I'm definitely excited about experiencing the game in multiple sessions. <br/><br/>There were many seemingly small things that the 3 games of IAWA I played at Dreamation missed. For example, there are very explicit rules for the order you assign best interests that made a big difference in our play last night. The game seems simple but I'm concerned that many people coming out of Dreamation didn't really get a real sense of what the game is like. And the game has been barely out and it's already been hacked like crazy! Which is ok in general but there is a lot there that needs to be thoroughly explored first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
