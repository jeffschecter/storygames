We had a good time, but in my opinion, getting to play with a smaller group is more enjoyable. Could you split into two groups?<br/><br/>It also takes much longer to play each round with more players. Depending on how much time you have to play, it will be easier to let each person have a turn being the Lens with fewer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378250/#Comment_378250" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T11:36:18+00:00" title="May 14, 2012 11:36AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would have trouble maintaining focus on a seven-player Microscope game.  There'd be a lot of idle sitting in that game, especially if one or more of the players are really indecisive about their contributions..<br/><br/>Maybe save it for a night when not everyone can make it?  Or as Emily suggests, split into groups of 3 and 4?

We didn't have a serious problem with people sitting idle, but I think it did dilute the core Microscope-ness a bit; there were so many ideas hitting the table that too many of them wound up not getting followed up on.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend splitting into two groups.  Four does seem to be the sweet spot, but I think three would be fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378394/#Comment_378394" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T07:54:10+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  7:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2012 3:28AM by mease19.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could be totally wrong but it might be neat to do Microscope as a mmRPG at a con where individuals make contributions or go off in little groups to play out a scene with others on hand.

I wouldn't recommend it. I've heard anecdotal reports of Microscope games that large that worked but I'm mystified how.<br/><br/>If you do split into two tables but want to keep your games connected, you can try picking one history idea together and then compare notes after you play to see how each group took the idea and ran with it. You can even start with the same beginning and ending bookends, so your games are almost like alternate histories of each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
