<p><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18707.0" rel="nofollow">"Brain Damage etc"</a></p>
<p>I'd like to comment on the presentation of the ideas, first. I'm already seeing shit like this in responses to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>"stub-fingered mutants"</li>
<li>"short-bus"</li>
<li>"leppers"</li>
</ul>
<p>So, while the words used might be "waking people up", it also means this next wave of discussion will probably offer me all kinds of lovely "retard jokes" and metaphors about the mentally disabled. That's just fucking great.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Moving on: so I find that the gist of his argument was that the claims of "story-oriented" roleplaying games have somewhat distorted our general notion of what "stories" really are. Am I right?</p>
<p>This brought to mind three friends in particular who are really into roleplaying, and generally like the White Wolf style illusionism-play; they're definitely bought into the claim that this generates the story they want, and use some mental editing to fit the events as shown into a "story" strucuture.</p>
<p>However, these three people are ALSO all students of Folklore &amp; Mythology (for serious), and live/breathe narratology. They've read up on all kinds of mythic structure, and they're all great at Real Live Storytelling - not RPG bullshit, but getting up and retelling an Anansi story in a captivating way, from start to finish.</p>
<p>Their understanding of what a story isn't mis-conditioned, but what they seem to expect from the RPG experience may well be. I believe this all jibes with what Ron is saying?</p>
<p>Also, I do feel that Ron's comments are ill-served by two digressions: (1) The various social dysfunctions he mentions under "DETAILS". I feel like this loses focus, from discussing mis-conditioning regarding "story" into axe-grinding about the things we dislike about gamer culture. (2) The tag at the end about the Sorcerer rules being unclear only to "damaged" gamers. Even if we're talking about those rules that some experienced gamers have a hard time coping with (ex: narration rights) this is distractingly self-serving. Did anyone else have similar reactions?</p>

                            You "see" terms like mutants and lepers? Where? 'Cause I don't see them, not in the responses in my thread, not elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
If you're seeing them in <i>your own head</i>, then that's disgusting. In fact, grotesque.<br/>
<br/>
Because "brain damage" is used as a pejorative by high-schoolers, does not mean a thing, except to people who have failed to shed high-school values. I have said, and continue to say, that I'm using it literally.<br/>
<br/>
Which is not a pejorative. Which cannot be an insult except to someone who wants to be insulted. It is a (layman's) diagnosis, as clarified by my example of sexual abuse.<br/>
<br/>
To ascribe me as expressing <i>contempt</i> for (for instance) survivors of sexual abuse, for people who have suffered mental/brain injury of any kind, or for people whose development is delayed compared to most ... is itself beneath contempt.<br/>
<br/>
You should be ashamed of yourself.                        </div>

                            Isn't there an injunction about discussing this topic elsewhere?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have a single line reaction: I cannot help but to believe that there exists a huge difference each way between orally telling a story, and writing a story, and gaming a story.<br>
<br>
For one thing, a traditional oral storyteller can play off of their audience's reaction, but is still the sole focus of their attention, and in control, more or less. <br>
<br>
Compare this to the story writer who can only guess who his audience will be, and try to have as much of the product, which will be finished before it is read, as possible apeal to this distant chosen group. <br>
I feel we tend to presupose this total control of the output; it exists in all of our broadcast media.<br>
<br>
Compare this to nar gaming where the audience and storyteller are one and the same; a small group that alternates to try and assemble a story like a jigsaw puzzle, and they introduce rules &amp; random elements to force the course of the narrative to go in unexpected diections.<br>
<br/>
I just cannot help but think that collaborative story *gaming* and collaborative *storytelling* games are going to end up to be two different things, as well.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Ron,</p>
<p>I specifically saw such phrases in some posts elsewhere in the blogosphere, but my more general point was: this choice of words will encourage insensitive language elsewhere, in the process of furthering the metaphor, without adding a great deal.</p>
<p>In my post, I was NOT suggesting that Ron was making  those hateful comments. I hope my post isn't generally misconstrued as such.</p>
<p>(Also, I'll be happy to nix this thread if there IS an injuction against discussion here.)</p>

                            My reaction to the thread was that I was hoping to see the bit that really echoed with me when Ron and I talked about it last week, the real world example. Thusfar, I'm not seeing it said word-for-word again, so I'll summarize it here:<br/><br/>==============================<br/><br/><b>We gamers say</b>: "This game (Deadlands, RIFTS, Burning Wheel, The Shadow of yesterday***, whatever) is a game fundamentally about telling stories.  What is the FIRST THING we need to do to create our story experience?  Why, we have to make up Characters".  <br/><br/>So we make up characters and then try to fit them into a Situation. Usually the GM puts them in a situation. All the players enjoy their game. That's nice. But it's something different than storytelling.<br/><br/><b>Now, OTHER people say</b> (and I'm not specifically saying "Players or Polaris" or Sorcerer or whatever, but I'm talking about average joe people, people who read books, watch TV shows like LOST or whatever, and have been influenced all their lives by stories), when they want to create a story: "OK, we'll begin with a Situation. Here's the world; here's what's going on.  Everyone on board? OK, NOW let's define the world a little deeper, putting in Characters that have to interact in this Situation" (or they characters are simply built INTO the situation).<br/><br/>===============================<br/><br/>That was the part that was most eye-opening for me: Gamers begin with making characers first (it's usually the first chapter or two of any RPG, after the "wishy washy grand-scale background" parts are laid out).  All other humans, who inherently know how to tell stories, begin with situation/main story elements first.<br/><br/>That's what really opened my eyes, and lead to the following personal convictions:<br/><br/>1) When I write my games, one of my goals is basically write so that, say, one gamer could introduce the game to 4 non-gamer friends and have it be instantly understood by "everyone".  "Everyone" already has the tools and knowledge of what stories are.  If I make my game more like a traditional storytelling experience, and put situation right up front, and rethink other elements that are standard fare for RPers, then my goal of having "everyone" able to pick up the game and quickly play will be closer realized.<br/><br/>2) And if I want to write a game for gamers, because those games are fun as hell too when done right, then I can consciously leave situation out, or tie it into the rules like Polaris, or create situation for the game in other ways, like the game All Flesh Must Be Eaten (where in the back there are 18 or so "example settings", which are all situations of some sort, but I would have put that in the front of the book, not the back).  In other words, I can still have a goal of writing games for gamers, but make subtle changes to realign the game towards a more understandable experience.<br/><br/>3) Finally, I remember my first RPG: Star Frontiers.  My dad and I picked it up when I was like 7-9 or so, and went through the basic rulebook, and made characters and played, using that giant map-thing that came with the book.  We literally had NO experience with D&amp;D or other RPGs, we just picked it up because we liked SF and the commercial for the game (an RPG Commercial!!! On TV!!!!) looked cool. We ended up playing the game like a board game, having our little cardboard pieces meander around from one place to another.  It was sorta fun for a little while, but we stopped after 2-3 sessions.  I could see by the depth of rules and background that there was "something deeper" going on, I just couldn't put my finger on what. There was all this racial background, some setting info, rules for breaking and fixing shit, etc. <br/><br/>About a year after we bought the game (though I read the books a lot, brought them on car trips, etc just to read the cool crunchy background), I remember I had an epiphany after reading the "adventure module" for like the 18th time: I'm supposed to use this game to MAKE UP AND TELL STORIES. It was such an utter flooring revelation, that I remember exactly where I was (after church, sitting in the back seat of a volvo, and I was wearing a white shirt) when I had it.  A couple weeks later, I was making up my own stories to have my father and I play through.<br/><br/>....But isn't that a little fucking ridiculous, when you think about it?  Why did it take me and my dad over a year to realize that we were supposed to use the game to make stories? Because it wasn't written anywhere in the book. It may have said "You will have adventures", but it didn't jive with any of our previous experiences with fiction, and we were both avid SF buffs, tearing through a book or more a week. I had to twist and turn and dig before I realized what was supposed to happen with the game.  I think most of the problem lies with the fact that most of these games were predicated upon an understanding of previous RPGs, or having been "brought into the fold" from others, etc.<br/><br/>4) I actually had an 6 month TSOY game stumble a bit (I had to reboot) because, after 6 MONTHS, I realized that there was no situation; we were sort of meandering from event to event with these "situation ripe" characters, not seating them in any situation. Through ignorance or whatever, we were just using TSOY to lpay D&amp;D. I "rebooted" the setting a little when we jumped to Revised, and together we created a really focused situation with the other players: It still was a little backwards, but it was better than pulling the plug completely: Sure enough, people were hitting their Keys, getting deeper into it, etc.  I know that I had a lot more fun then. At the time, I wasn't sure what the deal was: I thought the problem was that I had the characters wander about from place to place "D&amp;D Style" instead of setting them in one location where they could get their keys firing with background NPCs.  But no, that wasn't quite it: I just blew threw the small section at the beginning of the book which laid out ideas for starting up a Situation with the players.<br/><br/>Anyway, those were my reactions to that specific conversation. Personally, on that thread, I'm most in line with Levi's sentiments on the matter (as when we think of "brain damage" we almost immediately think "unrepairable") but still. Personally, I like Ron's metaphor more of "Wearing a better and better prosthetic lower leg; then looking down to see that your own lower leg was <i>always there, </i>just bent back, tied back to your upper leg". I took away a lot from that conversation.<br/><br/>--------------------<br/><br/>***Here's the fucking freaky part. I wanted to drop "Polaris", "Conspiracy of Shadows", "The Roach" or "Trollbabe" into that category, showing that I meant "all games", not "traditional ones".  Here's the problem with that, though: Polaris has Situation tied into the background and rules of the game: It is IMPOSSIBLE to read the book, play as written, and have no idea what to do with the progression of the story.  Trollbabe is, too, to a different degree: Not as much story-progression going on (like how to wrap them up, etc), but definitely has Situation on the goddamned character sheet. Other games, like Conspiracy of Shadows, Nine Worlds, and tons of other have been made with that "prosthetic" in mind where before chargen they clearly spell out that everyone should be onboard the situation creation: Create and agree on situation, then populate with characters. Though most of us just blow past that anyway. :-)<br/><br/>So yeah, in the last two years we've seen some games make loose, VERY loose ties with traditional story elements and the like.  But 2006 I think is the "line in the sand": From this point on, I'm expecting to see really cool games with zany settings and action, but that are written aimed squarely towards those storytelling parts of the brain, with better explanations of what to do and how to do it, etc. Or we'll see games manufactured towards traditional RPers, but even more juicy with an Understanding of how to make a story. Even if it's not used in the rules and game taext, a game written with that understanding will be easier to whip out and play than a game without. <br/><br/>Also, that conversation led me to "reboot" the game I'm currently working on a little.  I had as a goal to make it understandable for newbie gamers.  Now, having that above conversation in my toolbox, I'm backing up, and making sure that it's more ripe with situation-creation instructions and the like before character creation.  I already even had some of those bits on the character sheet, but now I'm turning it up a notch: Not too much, but just a little.                        </div>

                            Andy, <br/><br/>I'd have to argue with your analysis of how stories are constructed. However, I'll skip past the part where I talk about structuration and get to the main point: <br/><br/>In a very real way it doesn't matter if you have the chicken (character) or the egg (situation) first*. The real point is that the two cannot be done seperatly. You must do both at the same time, either whole or in cycle, or else you end up with a mess. <br/><br/>The problem with most RPGs isn't that they put character gen first, or that they put situation first, it is that they put them apart from each other. Hell, a lot of them put one in the players book and the other in a compeltely seperate book for the GM only with big letters saying "PLAYERS SHOULDN'T READ THIS." <br/><br/>After years and years of being conditioned to this -- the character is over HERE and situation is over THERE and never the twain shall meet -- we get used to doing it that way. We start to think that is the way to do it. <br/><br/>And then we do it all the time, even when playing games where it obviously won't work. <br/><br/><br/>*And yes, the chicken egg metaphor is used deliberatly to suggest that I think that even trying to seperate one from the other becomes an excercise in futility.                        </div>

But as for discussing anything, period, I don't have the role or place for dictating whether people discuss what I've written, aside from the etiquette rules I enforce at the Forge itself.

<p>Yes - it was a request.  Beg pardon.  Didn't mean to exagerrate there.</p>
<p>For some reason, I keep thinking there was another request about "If you have a problem with me, bring it to me." but I don't see <em>quite</em> that statement in what was said, now that I check back, though there were a few tones along those lines about other things.</p>

Just to reiterate somthing Ron put in his first post, he was talking specifically about Narrativist games/style.  So if you're taking offense at what he said (and you shouldn't be btw), then it's perhaps you enjoy Gamism or Simulationism instead.  Just something else to keep in mind :)<br>

<p>Troy,</p>
<p>Are you trying to reach a new level of snideness? Let me break it down real quick.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's an incontrovertible fact that I enjoy Narrativist games. One might, if one thought a lot of himself, think that he is in fact, one of the original braves to sit at Ron's campfire and then bring the fire to you savages.</p></li>
<li><p>I take offense at what Ron's saying. I have good reason to. He's not talking about me. He is, though, talking about the community which pointed me to his campfire. This community is also my customers, who I bring the fire to. He's saying they have forgotten how to use fire. Hey, that might be true. But he's using the most exclusionary language he could possibly find to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're one of those people that is now going to say, "But that language is technically correct. It's only your perceptions you're putting on it," then, seriously, don't. Ron's pulled this stuff, too, and it's silly when anyone does it. He's an incredibly smart man - frighteningly so - and he knows he's intentionally pissing people off with this language. He's well aware that all conversation happens within a community, and you'd best judge your words by the community they're within, not your own personal definition - even if technically correct.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, in short, "So if you're taking offense at what he said (and you shouldn't be btw)" is a ridiculous clause, and the idea that one person, be it you or someone else, knows what others should or shouldn't be offended by is hubris.</p>

<p>Ron's pissed off a lot of people.  They're <em>right</em> to be pissed off.  His language is so far over the top that I can only imagine that his intent was to shock and offend.  It has horribly muddied discussion of theory in several forums.</p>
<p>But Ron's under no obligation to not piss people off.  He's under no obligation to use temperate language.  He's under no obligation to help keep theory discussion clear for others.</p>
<p>When he does those things (and he's done them <strong>a lot</strong>) I am grateful.  When he doesn't I don't feel betrayed.  It's just Ron.  He's just this guy.  He says a lot of smart things.  He says some really bone-headed things (which are also smart).  And I'm pretty damn sure that some of the things I think are bone-headed he did <em>deliberately</em>, for his own purposes.  Ain't nothing wrong with that, but the fact that he had a <em>plan</em> doesn't make me think it was any less bone-headed.</p>

<p>I disagree. Not to get too about the Forge here, but he is under an obligation to <em>me</em>, expressed financially through my continued hosting and maintenence of the Forge. He is under an obligation to the community that was built by him and others, as they have built him up and put him in the position he is in. Do you think anyone would be talking about his theories without a continued and vital community surrounding them talking about them outside the confines of one forum? While elections were not formalized, he is pretty much a duly elected president of a movement and community. And that position comes with responsibility and obligation, most certainly.</p>

                            I think that one of the main reasons that so many people outside the Forge think Ron is a jerk, is his refusal to communicate using either neutral or non-confrontational language. <br/><br/>I CAN BE A JACKASS, but I can communicate ideas without being a jackass. <br/><br/>It appears to me, that on-line, Ron cannot.

                            The funny thing about those brain damage posts is that I didn't find them offensive. <br/><br/>I've found a lot of stuff Ron's said offensive. Ron has heard about it too. <br/><br/>But these posts? I don't know... I just didn't get pissed about them. If anything I was mildly amused by the level of rhetoric. It's like they were so far over the top they'd come around the other corner, and getting pissed about that is hard. <br/><br/>OTOH, things that folks say casually and without as much energy often piss me off far more. Perhaps because something like the brain damage posts feel constructed for effect (only Ron can say if they are or not) where offhand comments are usually far more revalatory of internal feeling.                        </div>

<p>Oh, the content?  I disagree with the content a bit ... I don't think people are "naturally" storytelling creatures in more of a way than we are (for instance) naturally moral creatures.  We've got potential that all-but-begs to be actualized, but it doesn't go and actualize itself.  Modern culture isn't as good at helping people actualize that potential as some cultures in the past were, and <em>no</em> culture has ever been as good as you'd think it was by only looking at the record left by its best storytellers.</p>
<p>To say that our naturally occurring storytelling impulses have been mischanneled?  I don't buy it.  I think that the screw-up in our heads results not from us <em>lacking</em> storytelling prowess (most everybody these days lacks that) but rather from us <em>believing that we have that prowess.</em>  It's not that we were naturally good, but we've been broken.  It's that we suck, but we think we rock, and we really, really, really don't want to lose that illusion of rocking.</p>

<p>I think that we are naturally storytelling creatures, and that the potential does naturally actualize itself.</p>
<p>Now, I don't make any claims as to there being any inherent quality in natural storytelling.  Naturally created stories can rock, or suck; my opinions there are hazy enough that I won't stand on them in debate.</p>
<p>But that first bit - that, I'd be willing to debate.</p>
<p>Are you in the mood for such, Tony?  And in what venue?</p>

                            I think we all play differently, and that any attempt to pigeonhole people are at best just wrong. the reason stereotypes are bollocks is that though they may appear at first blush to be accurate, with any scrutiny they collapse completely. Similarly saying that someone is playing "better" or "worse" is laughably subjective.                        </div>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>Have you ever read Impro by Keith Johnstone? <br/><br/>He has this little excercise in there where you get people to tell a story by tricking it out of them. Basically he tells someone he has made up a story, and then suggests they get it out of him by asking him questions to which he will reply yes, no, or maybe. The trick is he hasn't made up any story, and he answers yes to any question ending in a consonant, no to any question ending in a vowel, and maybe to any question ending in a y. <br/><br/>So the folks ask him questions, and he answers based on the last letter of their question. The result is that they "get out of him" stories that are both remarkable and often a little dirty or frightening. So long as the person thinks that they aren't the one making up the story, they will make up the most amazing stories. Consistantly and constantly. <br/><br/>Same deal in the post about the Story of the Day I did on Yu'd dice. Most people (with the annoying and notable excpetions of old ladies in supermarket checkout lines) can tell you a good story about something funny or frightening that happened to them. This is storytelling, but I think it gets around most folks blocks on the area by passing under our radar. "I wasn't telling a story" they say, "I was just telling you what happened." But they were, oh yes they were, telling you a story. <br/><br/>Those are kinds of damage that the authorial mind-fuck has put into the GP. There are more kinds of mind fucks that RPers face. I know that I got mindfucked in my late teens because of RPGing -- all my stories from the time I was 16 to 25 (not before, not after, when I fixed myself) read like D&amp;D the novel (or Shadowrun the novel, or whatever). They're fucking horrible, full of random pointless shit that serves no point in a story (but that would be obvious to any gamer as a point where you rolled dice). I know it happened to a lot of others too. <br/><br/>Now, I don't think that it happened to the majority (which Ron seems to indicate he believes) -- I'd say 40%, and that only within the demographic Ron is specifically talking about. But I do think it happened, and I do think it happened to enough people that it becomes something worth looking at and talking about.                        </div>

                            It really sounds like to me that everyone is talking about different levels of storytelling ability.  I don't think anyone is naturally a "great" storyteller, but I think everyone quickly is acculturated to understand the basics of conflict, escalation, climax, on an intuitive level.  And that, is the part I think gets broken in the whole affair.<br/><br/>Think of the last time someone told you "about their character".  People who try to tell you "about their character" are <i>trying</i> to tell a story, and usually failing in some serious fashion.   Then go have  a non-gamer tell you about a movie.  Now, not everyone is going to be an awesome storyteller, but man, there's definitely a qualitive difference in capability there.<br/><br/>And, while Ron might be talking about a specific style of play- I believe it has affected enough folks that even other types of gamers have caught "splash damage" from it.  Consider the rarity of a group with a cohesive CA.  Consider Gamists who, drag out play because, "that's what you're supposed to do".   Consider Illusionism, where even the "story"  follows pretty much the same "And, then, and then, and then, something happened" standard.                        </div>

<p><code>Are you in the mood for such, Tony? And in what venue?</code></p>
<p>Just ... like ... on its own?  A debate about the nature of storytelling and the human animal?  Nah.  It's all a big matter of greys and semantics at that point.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear whether you think that <em>what natural storytelling talent we possess</em> (without us having to necessarily agree on the extent of that) is actually damaged by roleplaying.  Do you think that someone with experience in an RPG is less able (to take Brand's example) to tell a story of what happened to them that day?</p>
<p>Or are those skilled just eclipsed by other, sucky, skills that they've been taught to believe are in fact better?</p>
<p>Because yeah, I know the feeling Brand talks about, of writing a story and having it come out like D&amp;D, and having it suck.  And then I had a teacher who said (basically) "Why not stop thinking of it like your D&amp;D skills apply to writing?  Pretend they don't, and see what happens."  And damned if all the story-telling skills (such as they were) that I'd developed at things other than D&amp;D weren't all there, still rarin' to go.</p>
<p>So, to my mind, I wasn't damaged ... I was just arrogant and more than a little stupid.</p>

<p>Damage, to me, means that something is <em>gone</em>.  That something has been lost.  And I don't think that's the case at all.</p>
<p>I'll use my own metaphor, and try to tell you what I think you're curious about, though.</p>
<p>This is largely about me.  I suspect it's also about other gamers that want story from their games, too.</p>
<p>I think that gamers that are in the habit of aiming for and attempting to get "story" from their games, especially including me, have this big chunk of habit we carry around in our heads related to that.  Big chunks of habit aren't bad of themselves, by any stretch - I mean, potty-training is a block of habits, too, and it's served me very well.  This particular chunk of stuff is composed of things that do work, and often things that don't work, and workarounds for the things that don't.</p>
<p>Now, let me mention that bit again, because I think it's important.   I think there are often things that don't work in that block of habit, and workarounds for them.  I think those things are there because we've been sold on them, and sold ourselves on them, and then had to work around them.</p>
<p>Now, we can put away those habits, open up, and just naturally tell stories.  Some of us don't, of course, just as some fan-ficcers choose to see the real stories they fic about through the lens of that fiction.  This doesn't mean that we can't.</p>
<p>We can try to filter down through that block of habit, and rebuild it.  That's hard; it's not impossible at all, but it takes a lot of slogging.</p>
<p>We can ignore the block entirely, and play something else - deliberately leaving the whole mass off to one side.  If what we play actually turns out to generate stories in roleplaying, without involving that block of habit, the habits rapidly start to break apart; finishing the job may still be hard, but starting is easy.</p>
<p>We can metaphorically do a lot of other stuff, too, but I'm already stretching.</p>
<p>Can you see what I mean?</p>

<p>Yeah, I get you.  I've heard you talking about this (elsewhere) in terms like "Go off to the side, and build a whole <em>new</em> set of skills, then bridge back and forth between the new and the old."</p>
<p>I haven't tried putting that into practice, but it sounds like a workable (and quite possibly very valuable) technique for a lot of things.</p>

<i>Think of the last time someone told you "about their character". People who try to tell you "about their character" are trying to tell a story, and usually failing in some serious fashion. Then go have a non-gamer tell you about a movie. Now, not everyone is going to be an awesome storyteller, but man, there's definitely a qualitive difference in capability there.</i><br/><br/>But this comparison shows nothing about capability -- only context.  If you want to see about a difference in actual storytelling ability, then have the gamer tell you about a movie -- i.e. the same thing which you're asking the non-gamer to do.  <br/><br/>Now, I'm open to the idea that there is some effect here.  Being a role-player may change how you tell stories to other people.  However, I haven't seen it in my views of role-players.  That is, I can't differentiate role-players even on average from other people based on how they tell me about a movie.  Some people are distinguishable as geeky in their mannerisms, but those are often boardgamers,  computer nerds, actors, music nerds, or sci-fi fans and not role-players.  I've also followed a number of psychological studies of role-players, and none of them have indicated any significant markers that would indicate such a difference.  <br/><br/>Outside of storytelling, Brand and Tony's writing anecdotes seem reasonable to me, but I haven't heard it as a major effect.  I know several role-players who have writing careers.  The biggest name would be George R.R. Martin, but there are plenty of others.  It seems like a normal problem of shifting between differing creative mediums.  Improv acting may give you bad habits as far as writing a structured novel.  Conversely, novel-writing may give you bad habits regarding screenwriting.  I have two friends who are studying screenwriting, and they describe that they have to drop their tendencies to narrate or describe in order to produce a better script.  Screenwriting is about writing the lines of dialogue and minimal description of the action, which is enormously different than writing a novel.                        </div>

<p>Is anyone still interested in the original bit of this thread- "Controversial statement, how do you feel about it?" and not, "Ron = Jackass, Fact or Opinion?" ? Should I make another thread or take it to my blog?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I'll answer this, but not before I do return to the topic I'm desperately trying to keep going here: it's important to hold your community leaders to standards. There. So, if you think calling other human beings "brain damaged" because your personal beliefs dictate that's an ok behavior, then I guess we're all good. Me, I think that way lies nothing but ashes.</p>
<p>The statement itself - well, I as much agreed above with it. I think that traditional "storytelling" games are neither good storytelling devices or good games, but that their marketing has told lots of people they are. Repeated buy-ins to this idea has resulted in a detriment to many people. Advertising is disease. Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>The problem with the statement is it's a problem with no solution presented. It's mean-spirited complaining. The question that should be asked is "What are you going to do about it? If this is a problem for you, how do you fix it?"</p>

                            Regarding natural storytelling ability:<br/>
<br/>
I have three kids (well, two stepkids I've been raising for the past six years and one toddler).  The older two are 9 and 11.  Their natural tendency in storytelling is to ramble and include every single detail.  They don't know how to summarize.  They don't even remotely have an idea of what a theme or premise is.  When they tell you what went on in the latest Simpsons episode, they make sure to tell you not only every word of dialogue (and interrupt each other to say nuh-uh, that's not what he said), they also, in the middle of telling the story, reach back to tell you all the previous things that happened so you have the proper context.  In short, they don't possess a natural ability to filter out the "core story."<br/>
<br/>
Now, you might say: Yes, but they're kids!  True. But how are they going to get to the point where they can understand and relate the core of a story?  They need to learn it.  In fact, since we're homeschooling, Lisa and I need to teach them.<br/>
<br/>
That's one anecdotal piece of evidence. Now, the other pieces in my anecdotal chest come from being an aspiring author who has been to workshops and writing groups--and from my own learning process regarding stories. I can now, finally, distill a premise from a story, but I'm still not highly proficient in it. And most aspiring writers I've met are terrible at that and at most other aspects of writing a good story.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that's not a bad thing. In fact, I frequently have to argue with assholes who think that writing is somehow a "talent" and you either have it or you don't (like Darren did on the Forge, and in response to which I wrote him a private message).  That's utter bullshit.  Storytelling is a craft; in fact, it's a larger field with several sub-crafts. It can be learned by just about anyone, but it's always hard work. Even for people who seem "gifted", they need to practice and edit and spend a lot of time on making a good story.<br/>
<br/>
Now, maybe that's not the level of proficiency we're talking about here. But even the basics, when people are told and go "ahh yes, conflict and characters and resolution and change", are not that easy to translate into actively creating a story.<br/>
<br/>
That all said: while I disagree that most people have a natural talent for storytelling, I agree that so-called storytelling games have tended to muddy the waters, give people bad habits, and overall created what I like to non-confrontationally refer to as "preconceived or conditioned notions" about how (storytelling) play should go. Getting those out of people's brains is hard work. Empowering them to actually focus on the story instead of those built-up artifacts will take time and energy, but most of all, probably more of a cooperative rather than an incinerating approach.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening :)<br/>

                            I never know what to make of how a few people keep people trying really, really hard to pretend that the "brain damage" thing is a defining trait of the Forge/indie/Story Games community that everyone agrees on. Next time it pops up (assuming it pops up in a context with people who are actually worth engaging) I'll have to link to this thread.                        </div>

                            The thing about Ron that I've observed is that he's written a lot of really interesting stuff. Where the meat of the interesting stuff was shrouded in academic language, and the easiest to understand parts had lot of vitriolic terminology that had been selected for reasons that were very existent, but not readily apparent.<br/><br/>And he had a real axe to grind about Vampire for some reason. Which is odd because in looking at it from my current perspective, the White Wolf games are actually pretty damn well thought out in most cases. Even by 'story game' standards. Well, the World of Darkness stuff anyway, less so some of their other games. *koff*exaltedscion*koff*. (all IMO of course)                        </div>

I was kind of a dick.  When I discovered the Forge, I was suddenly all "indier than thou" and being an absolute wanker about it.  <br/><br/>Edit:  If it matters, I don't blame the Forge or anyone for it.  It was all me, being a giant cock.                        </div>

But the Brain Damage thing wasn't trolling though, right? Listening to <a href="http://theoryfromthecloset.com/2007/05/14/show008-interview-with-ron-edwards/" rel="nofollow">his extensive conversation with Clyde</a> about it (TFTC episode 8, I have a hard time believing it's trolling.

Well, Ron has an axe to grind with the term "Story Game" as well, for that matter. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In my experience, really focused play of Sorcerer highlights what Ron was so disdainful of <i>vis-a-vis</i> Vampire.<br/><br/> </div>

                            O...kay? Is there some objective scale of opinion-words that places "disdain" above "not my thing, but I got nothing against it" and below "dysfunctional, harmful mess and no one should play it"...? I was not aware.

                            I remember the "brain damage" essays. At first I thought he was speaking metaphorically. Then people told me he was literally saying that traditional games cause brain damage. I work with people with brain damage (social worker by day) so I couldn't buy the argument. It felt like it was telling everyone working in the game industry that they had damaged the people they served. How can that be taken as not an attack. <br/><br/>I backed out of the discussions at the time. <br/><br/>Right now I'm still not at all certain what was meant to be communicated or to happen next. It was not effective communication as far as I'm concerned. I have altered some of my game ideas as I've been in this community (moving toward simpler prettier games) but the change never came from bomb throwing. <br/><br/>Thanks for the second look at the topic. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>

                            I have disdain for pog collecting and Taylor Swift fandom, but they don't <i>hurt</i> anyone, disdain is just a matter of taste, even slightly snooty, full-of-myself taste. You can disdain totally okay things.  <br/><br/>Putting writing Vampire in the same category as hitting someone in the head with a claw hammer really is a LOT more severe than just "welp, I really like this much-more-focused Sorcerer play a lot better, Vampire is not worthy of my consideration anymore".  Didn't mean to derail, it just seemed off-base.<br/><br/>If you're still cool with "disdain", it's fine with me! Maybe it'll be like "indie" games (or "pulp" games) and my definition won't survive.                          </div>

<blockquote><i>All that is the foundation for my point: that the routine human capacity for understanding, enjoying, and creating stories is damaged in this fashion by repeated "storytelling role-playing" as promulgated through many role-playing games of a specific type. This type is only one game in terms of procedures, but it's represented across several dozens of titles and about fifteen to twenty years, peaking about ten years ago. Think of it as a "way" to role-play rather than any single title. <br/><br/>I now hold the viewpoint that in every generation, inspired and interested young teens and younger college students are introduced to a fascinating new activity that they are eminently qualified to excel at and enjoy greatly. However, subculturally speaking, it's a bait-and-switch, especially during the time-period outlined above. Instead, they were and are exposed to damaging behavior as they learn what to do, and therefore, the following things happen. (1) They associate the procedures they are learning with the activity itself, as a definition. (2) The original purpose which interested them is obscured or replaced with the "thing," or pseudo-thing, of the new purpose, which no one is qualified to excel at, nor does it offer any particular intrinsic rewards. </i></blockquote>
This was followed by pages and pages of self-hatred and bandwagoning as people jumped in to add "Yes, I too was brain damaged, but thanks to TEH WUNDARZ of INDIE ROLEPLAYING I am free of this damage!"                         </div>

                            I don't know why I feel compelled to contribute to this but I do.<br/><br/>My take has always been this: I don't care about the Brain Damage aspect of this discussion.  I'm not a biologist like Ron.  I'm not a neuro-scientist either.  I have ZERO qualifications or interest to comment on the Brain Damage real or not portion of the discussion.<br/><br/>However, I find Ron's behavioral analysis spot on.  I have seen the process and resulting behaviors he describes again, again and again.<br/><br/>Someday we'll be able to actually talk about THAT, outside the "Brain Damage" issue.  Looks like today is still not that day.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

                            MatrixGamer, if you're a social worker I would have thought you'd see how a person going through difficult circumstances during their formative years can affect their various capacities?<br/><br/>Let's look somewhere else for a moment - do eating disorders 'just happen', or do peer pressures and enviromental factors set off these pathological conditions?<br/><br/>I just vaguely remember the original BD post, but if someone has all the capacity to describe story as much as a bulimic has to keep down a meal, there's a paralel.

                            I wasn't offended by what Ron said, but I thought the way it was done was beyond stupid. If he had laid out the steps of his 'reasoning', actually a series of leaps of faith, it would have been clear that there are two choices: either roleplayers are brain damaged, or there is something wrong with Ron's argument.<br/><br/>This argument ran something like: story-telling innate to humans*, therefore reflected in brain structure, one particular view of 'story' derived from Lajos Egri taken as canonical*, playing RPGs changes storytelling habits, therefore must alter brain, result is not consonant with Egri, therefore innate human ability has been reduced, therefore brain must be damaged.<br/><br/>Most of us would have gone with "something wrong with Ron's argument". Both asterisked statements are either assumptions or deduced from very limited data, and every single "therefore" is disputable. In fact, I don't think there's a single "therefore" in the argument that I would agree with, even if we take the asterisked stuff on trust.<br/><br/>But instead we got a blanket statement that this was true, an largely worthless appeal to authority "I am a biologist" (yeah, big deal, most biologists would think this argument was pure speculation), and a tendency to say that because he was willing to debate people about the steps involved, he was justified in asserting it as truth, which is the sort of thing I expect from nerdy first-year undergraduates, not mature adults. <br/><br/>So not offended, but entirely unimpressed.                        </div>

That problem of characterisation is simply your own requirement for acceptance, not a problem in the idea. Before smoking was widely held to destroy health, I'm sure many individuals would have claimed it was bad for ones health, sans any formal study, sans any presented data, based on anecdotes. If someone wanted say there's a problem with the characterisation of this 'smoking is bad for you' claim back then, the only problem in that is that persons requirements for accepting it.
<blockquote>and number two, we're talking about <i>gaming</i>, not social and medical issues.</blockquote>
The idea contends your seperation is incorrect. If you're case closed on that, okay. But to open the case involves humouring the idea of not treating those two as oil and water.
<blockquote>Bulimia is a serious condition, and yet we're comparing people's <i>roleplaying behaviors</i> to it?</blockquote>
<i>Some</i> behaviours. I don't know whether you A: take the notion people are story creatures as false or B: take it as true to some extent but don't accept that nature could be damaged or C: You do take B to be true to some extent, but consider the damage potential to the very nature of a human to be only minor at most. But making a comparison between the two - if that makes a joke for anyone, they are making that joke.                        </div>

Depends whether the Lajos Egri view is 'just a theory', or over a large segment of the regular population, it roughly coincides with what is the neuro-typical across that segment.<br/><br/>If it is neuro-typical, and a deviation is occuring...how is that taken?<br/><br/> </div>

                            Oh. My. God.  The discussion of functional story creation in RPGs has evolved so far from Egri.

The least important of which is whether or not there is Brain Damage involved.<br/><br/>The *interesting* observation is that strict adherence to a style of play promoted by the publishing culture of the 90s fostered a collection of social and creative dysfunctional behaviors.

Fuck Brain Damage.  <br/><br/>I WILL Knife Fight a Man that there's something to be learned from that observation. <br/><br/>Let's talk about that.  No?

Not sure I understand at all what you're getting at here. Yes, Egri was a good/insightful writer/instructor? That's never been at issue? If what had been advanced by the essays was "here's what this guy Egri has to say about good stories, I bet we could use this", it would be completely uncontroversial and cool?                          </div>

I don't know if we were made dysfunctional, but following the advice in WW RPGs when I first came in (early 00s) led to a lot of crappy gaming and some weird power dynamics in high-school with people who took the "RPGs tell stories and you are the STORYTELLER" too seriously.<br/><br/>If anything, it reminds me of the recent discussions around of the role of narrative in video-games, where you've got people who see games primarily as vehicles for the designer's narrative and the same mechanics that have been used a hundred times before glued to the side, and people who want better designed, actual games that may or may not include emergent narrative as a result of the player interacting with game elements.  Also, the retro and indie movements bringing the focus back on game design and gameplay rather purely aesthetics and than the ability of an unknown writer to craft a decent "experience" in lieu of a game (and not write laughable and/or painful dialogue).                        </div>

That was only part of the time for my group back then (a few bad eggs we eventually kicked out), but a discussion of actual text would be cool.  I'd like to be wrong (because that means I'll have learned something).<br/><br/>TBH I don't even know if I have my old Vampire and Exalted books, but I may have the PDFs floating around on an external hdd somewhere.  I'll have to take a look and if so, re-read some stuff.                        </div>

Zinga!<br/><br/>Still, I don't *think* it was all that.  I would say I still felt the advice wanting in terms of being a teaching tool, especially since we were all new to this weird dice-game-thing-sorta-storytelling-sorta-not-activity.<br/><br/>But it's been like 6+ years since I've touched a d10 dice-pool, so...yeah.

                            I don't see anything controversial in saying that people who learn a thing called X in circumstance Y may conflate X with Y, and default to Y-related behaviors when presented with X in the future.<br/><br/>The kerfuffle only arrives when you start filling that assertion with value judgments ("damaged", not "modified") and hot-button analogies (child molestation, brain damage).<br/><br/>Was there ever any discussion of productive takeaways from all this?  (I mean the X/Y thing, not the hot-button thing.)  Something like, "If you're trying to introduce a non-White Wolf game to people who learned roleplaying from White Wolf, here's how to communicate it to them?"<br/><br/>I have a game where each player will, at times, take on a role where their task is to provide fictional opportunities for the spotlight character to get what they want.  I've discovered that calling this role "GMing" is a bad idea, because many players bring in their GMing behaviors that are appropriate for other games but not for this one.  Simply introducing it as "GMing but not like GMing in other games" from the get-go has made a world of difference.<br/><br/>A more difficult scenario is introducing deadly dungeon crawls <i>with</i> GM warnings to players who are used to deadly dungeon crawls <i>without</i> GM warnings.  This seems to require not just the up-front warning ("I'm not going to randomly drop a death trap on you or challenge you to notice it; I will always give <i>clear</i> signs so you can <i>decide</i> whether to risk it") but also an awareness of problematic behaviors (checking every door, corner and pebble for traps) and correcting them on the spot ("No need for that, I promise.  Remember, I'll give you warnings.").<br/><br/>If I can get adversarial GMs and paranoid players to get over those habits in the span of a few hours (I mean, y'know, not perfectly, but well enough to have a fun game), I bet there's a way to teach Sorcerer to Vampire players too.                        </div>

Well, one of Ron's criteria seems to be that the people allegedly afflicted cannot describe their play in terms of 'conflict, rising action, climax, conclusion'<br/><br/>Was there a protest that the notion of 'conflict, rising action, climax, conclusion' is untypical of the way most of the population engage story? If not, okay, I don't need to address that then.<br/><br/>Moving on instead, as a hypothetical, while most handle story in a 'conflict, rising action, climax, conclusion' way, what if some people cant describe or deal with story in that way (and let's assume they were not born that way). That scenario seems shocking to me.<br/><br/>Let's just treat it as a hypothetical for now. Does it seem an impossible hypothetical to anyone? If not impossible, does it seem shocking to anyone? Or anything else?

I think you'd have to agree, if you tinkered with the rules of basketball to make outcomes in play and at the end of play be more ambiguous, you would make the weird power dynamics even more freakin' weird. At the very least, surely everyone agrees it is possible to deliberately write rules that undermine and make power dynamics even weirder (in those who continue to play instead of dropping it all in disgust)?<br/><br/>Then it's just a short step over to the idea of inadvertantly writing rules that make power dynamics weirder.                        </div>

<blockquote>Moving on instead, as a hypothetical, while most handle story in a 'conflict, rising action, climax, conclusion' way, what if some people cant describe or deal with story in that way (and let's assume they were not born that way). That scenario seems shocking to me.</blockquote>
Not to me. It seems like they just don't like that structure. Maybe they prefer an approach like Aristotle, where it's reversals, recognition and suffering that are the key elements.  Just saying "your theory of literature doesn't work for me" is not shocking and shouldn't be, to anyone. <br/><br/>Besides, your hypothetical remains way off base from what the controversy was about. Remember that the prophylactic future story-interested gamers must swallow to prevent future Brain Damage is narrativism.  Narrativism, according to the essays, requires a much BIGGER piece of Egri to be swallowed, the "premise", and that the players (all of them that want to avoid brain damage, I guess?) must be the ones to make the moral statement associated with the Egri-defined "premise".  <br/><br/>The overwhelming majority of books on the shelf next to me don't have an Egri-style premise in any significant way, and defining them according to that premise doesn't describe them well. I have no problem rejecting that structure as a fruitful way to analyze Len Deighton, Rex Stout, Dashiell Hammett, or Ross McDonald (the first-glance list). If you really really dig you can probably find an Egri-style moral premise in Might As Well Be Dead by Rex Stout, it's probably something like "murder is wrong and a smart guy can figure it out even if you think he can't", but that's not really the point of the book and an analysis of the book that starts from that premise as its central concern is not going to get anywhere.<br/><br/>I'm always surprised that so much of this goes back to how people were treated in high school.  (This is because I'm dumb and forget that this suffices to explain virtually everything every time the subject comes up.)                        </div>

                            It's nothing to do with 'dislike', it's a matter of incapacity. Someone might not like 2+2=4, but are still able to conclude what 2+2 equals.

I don't even understand this. What you're saying is that I should be able to take a story structure that I disagree is useful and apply it usefully to a story.<br/><br/>Could you do the same with Aristotle's structure of a good protagonist, reversal, recognition and suffering, say, to  American Psycho?<br/><br/>I know I couldn't. I'm flat incapable of it. It doesn't seem to apply.<br/><br/>Similarly, I can't apply premise to most of my mysteries. Like if I really really struggle I might be able to come up with a completely shitty premise that tells you nothing. It really doesn't prove any "capacity" or "incapacity" on my part.

I don't even understand this, like...are you saying, if I taught someone the four point structure, and taught them the story of the tortoise and the hare, and asked them to apply one to the other, and they couldn't, that would be shocking? I don't get this at all or how it is even remotely related to anything Edwards said in the essay.                        </div>

                            One of the things that I think is interesting from an historical perspective, both in terms of looking back at 2000ish when Ron published the original, infuriating essays and at 2006 when this thread was from: the S-G/indie/Forge diaspora community has come a very long way from valuing Narr play only. We have a lot of games that really support the other two agendas Ron identified, because people with a different set of preferences have come into the community.<br/><br/>As I've pointed out before, it's essentially an historical accident that the Forge movement was founded by someone who so profoundly misunderstands Gamist and Sim play. Look at the original essay on Simulationism! He cites GURPS as an example of a Sim-supporting game, and then says, "Hey, there's nothing wrong with that, but I myself just don't enjoy Sim play." When in fact GURPS, though it may be simulat<i>ive</i>, doesn't in any meaningful way actually support Right To Dream play at the table. And the character generation system works directly against this goal by being a huge min-maxer's dream.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>

                            Oh, Ron Edwards.  <br/><br/>So there's a concept that has some (or lots of) anecdotal truth, a neat little application in gaming (albeit not this time,) and Ron gave it an odd name, and then demanded everyone else use his terrible name to talk about the concept, and patronizingly argued to the death that he was right.  Bangs, murk, brain damage -- the nomenclature still stings, this applies across arguments.  (Hell, I'm not even saying he was necessarily wrong.)  <br/><br/>I'm still pretty thankful for kickers being popularized largely by him (at least as far as I know,) and his dedication to discussing theory, but, ugh.  Ron is grating to read to this day.                        </div>

<blockquote>What you're saying is that I should be able to take a story structure that I disagree is useful and apply it usefully to a story.</blockquote>
Just be able to apply it. The essay doesn't seem to be bothered if you find no use in applying it. Just whether you are able to.<br/><br/>I haven't seen American Psycho, to be honest, but I could read a wiki summery (I'm not into violent movies) and give a shot at applying that Aristotle structure to it (after all, everyone thinks they are a good guy, after all) OR the four point structure. I'm not sure it'd be that useful, but the idea of trying doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>Applying the four point structure does seem, from my subjective view, to bother you. Heck, you could say it's like a vegetarian is bothered by the idea of eating meat, if you like - could say it's some kind of principle, not some kind of BD.
<blockquote>if I taught someone the four point structure, and taught them the story of the tortoise and the hare, and asked them to apply one to the other, and they couldn't, that would be shocking? I don't get this at all or how it is even remotely related to anything Edwards said in the essay. </blockquote>
<blockquote>The person cannot summarize <b><i>any</i></b> story in simple four-point structure (conflict, rising action, climax, conclusion) - they typically hare off into philosophical or technical interpretations</blockquote>

So I could satisfy this requirement by listening to you apply it and repeating the same words back to you when you asked?  In other words, I can handle this by having a tape recorder.<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/> </div>

Well, I think it was written with an honest intention to promote verisimilitude and also maintain character balance. It just had the unfortunate side-effect of incentivizing crazy min-maxing.                        </div>

                            Agreed 100% with both your comments, Matt.  Min-maxing was a staple of all my GURPS character creation, and GURPS resolution supports Sim about as well as using cards instead of dice supports Nar.  It won't <i>stop</i> you, but it doesn't, in itself, help <i>at all</i>.<br/><br/>Years later, Ron gave props to <i>Dead of Night</i> for successfully celebrating cinema horror; this is an <i>infinitely</i> better example than GURPS.  Compare to Ron's own example Sim game at the end of his essay on Simulationism: Mongrel's system is mostly about tracking a bunch of character stats whose interactions are dictated by in-fiction logic.  Which is cool as far as it goes... but that's as far as it goes (that I remember, anyway).                        </div>

                            Not to make this all a bit too necro, but in hopping back to the beginning of the thread for context, I caught this from Ron's first post in it:
<blockquote>Because "brain damage" is used as a pejorative by high-schoolers, does not mean a thing, except to people who have failed to shed high-school values. I have said, and continue to say, that I'm using it literally. </blockquote>
The level of naivete on display there is shocking. "Failed to shed high-school values" describes literally everyone I have ever met, besides those who haven't attended it. To put it in terms Ron would understand, high school damages brains permanently and without exception. It takes a pretty rarefied (or, as I suspect in the case of scientific academia, self-deceiving) social context not to see that adult life (at least in the US) means accepting, and dealing with, the fact that nobody gets over high school.<br/><br/>And I'd bet money that in high school, Ron tried the same trick of insisting that his literal meanings be the only meaning people took from him. I bet it worked just as well, and made him just as popular, back then.                        </div>
