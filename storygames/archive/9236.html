The task is: do you determine the coordinates of your destination? The conflict is: do you get to your destination? Pretty much the same.<br/><br/>More generally, you can treat tasks as conflicts. So you're making a Pilot roll. But, although it <i>sounds</i> like a Task roll, you say to the players "You're probably going to get into the warpgate anyway. The question is whether you do it safely". So, although it seems like a roll for the task "Pilot the ship", it's actually a roll for the conflict "Do you pilot the ship safely?".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204370/#Comment_204370" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T06:03:37+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  6:03AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I've been saying for years, conflict and task resolution are not same types of object. Making them an either/or proposition is a category error. All games have both:\n<ul>\n<li>"Task resolution" is the part of the game system that determines whether characters succeed in individual tasks, as the name signifies. All games have task resolution systems, for otherwise tasks would not get resolved, would they? Sometimes the system is a complex mire of "the GM decides except if he wants you to roll for it" sort of thing, sometimes it's "you always succeed, except if it's a conflict situation", sometimes it's something else.</li>\n<li>"Conflict resolution" is the part of the game system that determines which of incompatible character intents holds sway over a discrete situation in the game. This doesn't even make sense in all types of games, but for those that it does, it's pretty straightforward: dramatic stories especially depend on the concept of conflict being possible at all, so having a system for explicitly resolving them (as opposed to implicitly) is very useful. This doesn't have anything to do with task resolution, necessarily: in some genres characters fail in tasks all the time while still succeeding in conflicts. Some games emulate that, too: in <i>Elfs</i>, for example, characters can explicitly fail in what they were trying to do while still gaining what they were trying to gain.</li>\n</ul>(Note that this issue is historically muddled due to what I call the <i>turning-point conceit</i> of dramatic gaming: traditionally many conflict resolution games insist that conflicts are actually resolved by choosing a narratively pleasing turning-point in the narrative sequence and agreeing that this particular task in the story represents the whole conflict, after which this single task resolution procedure then resolves the whole conflict. Sort of like saying that when Luke attacks the Death Star, we won't roll dice for any part of the attack run except the last shot down the ventilation shaft, that being the only task in the sequence we actually care about. This is why many conflict resolution games have you choose individual skills for the character to use in the situation and otherwise make the process resemble task resolution: it actually is task resolution, the task outcome is just extended to cover the conflict's outcome as well.)<br/><br/>Considering the above carefully, there is no contradiction in having the same exact rules do "both kinds of resolution". What that means is just that in some situations you choose, as a matter of GMing method, to interpret the task resolution results as more or less binding on the dramatic intent present in the scene. Playing both ways resolves conflicts, too: if you never acknowledge the conflicting intents present in the scene, then their conflict will get resolved in some manner anyway, it's just that the players never get to be in full control of how and when that happens.<br/><br/>The short of it is that I don't consider shifting between a "realistic" task resolution mode and "dramatic" conflict resolution mode a problem for actual play, but you might want to consider how you write that up in your game text: something like The Shadow of Yesterday is very careful about making the players aware of why the dice are being rolled and which conflicts are being resolved with each procedure, and for good reason: were it solely up to the GM to decide in his head what a given roll resolves, the players couldn't make sharp and dramatic choices anymore about what their characters are willing to pay to triumph in given situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204380/#Comment_204380" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T06:54:28+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  6:54AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: simjames</cite>Do you think that there is any fundamental issue with having both kinds of resolution as options within a single game system?

Thoughts?</blockquote>\nLet's be clear---you don't have <i>both</i> styles of resolution, you currently have <i>one</i> system that's ambiguous as to how it should be handled. That's bad.<br/><br/>To iterate Eero's point, it's OK to mix-and-match if the text is clear about when different resolution styles apply, or at least sets up a procedure so that players can decide amongst themselves when to do what. <br/><br/>See, in every conflict there are really two things that have to be "resolved" or decided (I think this is what Eero was getting at)---the first is character <i>actions</i>, and the second is the <i>effect</i> of those actions. Most "conflict resolution" mechanics concern themselves only with the latter, while traditional "task resolution" mechanics concern themselves only with the former. ("Conflict resolution" mechanics, stereotypically, also tend to operate on a higher "scale", such that there might be only one roll to determine the outcome of a given scene; while "task resolution" mechanics traditionally operate on a low scale, such that several rolls are required. This often leads to the misunderstanding that the difference between styles is inherently about "scale", but really that's an independent variable.)<br/><br/>Problems in play occur when one of the players thinks they are resolving one of those (action or effect), while another player thinks they are resolving the other. The classic example is the person who's rolling for an action, but thinks they are rolling for effect. Let's say the player is trying to break into a house (effect), so they say they are climbing up to the second story window (action). They roll and succeed, but instead of getting into the house, the GM or whoever goes, "Sorry, you climb up but the window is locked."<br/><br/>But the reverse can happen, too. Let's say two characters are sword fighting on a cliff, and one of them says, "I try to kill him!" Now, for whatever color or thematic reason, what the player really wants is to literally run the opponent thru (action). But the narrator, thinking the conflict is just about the life of the villain (effect), declares that the villain jumps off the cliff, rather than be beaten. You can see how the player would feel cheated.<br/><br/>So that's the long way of saying you need to be clear about what exactly is being resolved.<br/><br/>Lastly, real quickly I'll point out Dogs as a game that resolves both issues. A goal (aka, effect) is declared at the start of a conflict, and then all the raises and such determine the success of individual actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204398/#Comment_204398" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:47:36+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:47AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Eero and Tim said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204403/#Comment_204403" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:58:28+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:58AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>To iterate Eero's point, it's OK to mix-and-match if the text is clear about when different resolution styles apply, or at least sets up a procedure so that players can decide amongst themselves when to do what.</blockquote>\nI should clarify that <i>at this point in time</i> there is no core "text" for this game. I run it at conventions where it would be unreasonable to expect players to have read any rules before sitting down, so the "text" currently involves me describing the basics, providing a one-page summary of the imprtant rules, and providing any further explanations as they become relevant in play. That has been okay; players seem to grok the rules after a few rolls, and a few of the guys who played last October remembered the basics when playing the next game this Easter just past.<br/><br/>Most of my gaming at home is stuff like ORE, which might be described as "task oriented" by folks who like to make these distinctions; however, historically I run live-action and freeform games at conventions, which are very different. I've found that with this particular game I am blending GMing styles that were previously distinct. I'm considering whether this is maybe a good thing, and if so how to capitalise on it.<br/><br/>But yes, clarity is important. As I develop more materials intended for players/other readers to use (as opposed to my personal design notes, which can be fragmented or sparse as long as they help me to remember exactly how I want something to work) then I'll certainly be sure to strive for that. Providing options to empower players to make their own decisions rather than reactively respond to the lures I toss into the water - that would be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204409/#Comment_204409" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T08:15:17+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  8:15AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Traditional roleplaying has always used conflict resolution in just the way you describe, I think. It is obvious to me that enjoyable traditional play with a strong GM will, by necessity, have the GM adopt a conflict-based interpretation of many situations to make the players feel like they actually influence things in the game. The only difference towards conflict-based rpg texts is that in a traditional game the choice as to whether a given task resolution procedure resolves a conflict, or which conflict it resolves, is always on the GM's side of the table.<br/><br/>For example, if you didn't resolve conflicts with task rolls, a thief climbing up a cliff in D&amp;D would never reach the top, or if he would, it would only happen by GM fiat with no correlation to successful or failed climbing checks. Should such a correlation actually exist in the practical play of a given group, then the GM is actually allowing a conflict resolution to happen at this time. You'll note that this often correlates with whether a given GM is considered fair or not - all roleplayers except that the resolution procedures would allow them to influence conflicts, the differences are just in when and how.<br/><br/>So I think that what you're describing is an eminently sensible and common way of playing. Only the most hardline auteur GMs play with a strict task resolution system wherein the players get to resolve lots of tasks, but the GM always and without exception determines what happens to the conflicts in play. Even then I doubt that you'd find a group that would accept the GM's resolutions if they without fail went against the current task resolution landscape in play; it's pretty difficult for the GM to declare that the villain escapes after you've succeeded in half a dozen increasingly different skill checks about everything the GM could think of, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204416/#Comment_204416" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T08:27:09+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  8:27AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BW's take on this is so interesting, because it seems to bridge the gap: Figure out your intent, and then assign one or more tasks to accomplish that intent.<br/><br/>Intent is functionally identical to "conflict" as it's used in other games (particularly when paired with prenegotiated failure consequences -- you've just staked out the dimensions of the conflict), but you still get that task-by-task feel of a traditional game.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
