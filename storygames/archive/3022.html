To an outsider they are really both a mess.  The main issue is what happens to someone with limited exposure.  They know what RPGs are, maybe they played in a session or two or someone has tried to explain it, but they haven't picked up any terminology.  In that case the real issue as I see it are what you might call "dangerous terms" or "false leads" or something.  The terms that don't stand out as being something that you simply have to look up.  For example hearing GM for the first time, or bang used as a noun in that context, I'm not likely to try to guess their meaning.  On the other hand "reaction chart" and "narrativism" both carry enough information in either the component words or roots that I might be tempted to try to guess if the context is strong enough.  The context wasn't strong enough here, but it could be if the sentences were more meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68869/#Comment_68869" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T07:29:47+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  7:29AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think many, many more casual roleplayers are aware of what a GM, NPC, and d20 are than are aware of what Narrativism and bangs are.<br/><br/>If I know nothing about roleplaying I think they're both nonsensical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68870/#Comment_68870" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T07:30:31+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  7:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>I don't know what bangs are.

And it instantly becomes a lot more understandable, or apparently so to the casual reader, because the main source of confusion (what do all these abbreviations mean?) is eliminated.<br/><br/>Now I'm looking at:<br/><br/>"Man, our session last night was really cool. I felt like my character was really a protagonist, because we had some really good bangs and we finally got our teeth on Narrativism this session."<br/><br/>... I don't know if I can actually rewrite this, because my grasp of Forge RPG Theory is weak.<br/><br/>"Man, our session last night was really cool. I felt like my character really got a chance to shine in the spotlight, because we had some really good scenes to play off and we finally managed to work out how to share the storytelling."<br/><br/>I don't even think that's a correct "translation" by me.<br/><br/>Of course, the thing is that none of us are really writing jargon for "outsiders," so the question itself seems a little ambiguous. The real question is who your audience might be, and what you can assume they'll know.<br/><br/>Both of these sentences are taken out of context, or rather, without any context at all, and context matters for a lot. If inserted in the middle of an explanation of Narrativism, there's nothing wrong with the latter. If posted on someone's roleplaying journal, there's nothing wrong with the former (even with unexpanded acronyms).<br/><br/>It's all about good writing, ultimately, and most gamers don't know how to write well, including a lot of game designers. Most game designers only know how to use jargon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68875/#Comment_68875" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T07:35:15+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  7:35AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fred --<br/><br/>Cool addenda to the exercise!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68876/#Comment_68876" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T07:36:20+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  7:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I imagine the first to be much less accessable to an outsider than the second.  <br/><br/>In the first, "GM" is used as a verb.

Regardless of whether or not you use acronyms, however, the word signals that it belongs to the "code" of role-playing language. But a word like "protagonist," which is on its face more intelligible than "GM," is not obviously within what linguists would call the "register" (i.e., bank of words) of roleplaying: it could belong to literary criticism, for example. The slightly greater ambiguity may make for lesser "intelligibility."<br/><br/>But it's a blind alley to talk about whether or not a sentence is relatively accessible or inaccessible to "an outsider," so let's not do that. I think it's better to consider what a hearer needs to know in order to make sense of the sentence; or, better, what sense of the sentence a particular interpreter can make based on what they already know.

Then that's kinda like cheating because your traditional gamer is an "insider" in the first case and an "outsider" in the second case, of course, but many more people know the traditional gamer jargon than know the more Forge / indie / story-game type jargon in the second sentence.<br/><br/>I can also think of a number of people who are on the periphery of all this TRPG stuff that would get the first one pretty readily, though. Folks who've <i>heard of</i> D&amp;D and who've played a computer/console game or two, so they're familiar with the biggest jargon stumbling-block in the first post, which is "NPC." Geek tropes and all that. (Yeah, I'd prefer to disentangle RPGs from geek tropes, too.)<br/><br/><br/>To me, the biggest difference is that I perceive words like "bang" and "Narrativism" to be more <i>definite</i> and therefore somewhat trickier to master. Whereas RPG players will use words like "game balance," "roleplaying," or "character" to mean a whole slew of different things (particularly "roleplaying" -- that's a word that's been recycled and redefined to the point of uselessness, in my opinion).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68896/#Comment_68896" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T08:46:12+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  8:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first quote has more undecipherable spots but is ultimately clearer because you know it about playing a game. <br/><br/>The second quote has more recognizable words but it reads as a mish-mash of three different conversations, one about theatre, one about sex, and one about something that might be literary theory. <br/><br/>the second was also harder to rewrite, at least for me:<br/><br/>"I hate it when I moderate a role playing game because I have to play all the minor characters.

That may introduce an unintended tonal bias on things.  But this is a minor nitpick.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>"I hate it when I GM a game because I have to play all the NPCs.  So now I just roll a d20 and look at the reaction chart whenever my PCs want something from an NPC."</blockquote>\nAs an outsider, I would read this as --<br/><br/>"I hate it when I (perform some activity the outsider doesn't understand, abbreviated as GM) a game becaues I have to  play all the (undesirable thing abbreviated as NPCs).  So now I just roll a (rollable thing, called a d20; I could apply some critical thinking here to suss out that there are 20-sided dice, but that's not a given) and look at the reaction chart ("reaction chart" at least makes some sense, as I would understand the component concepts -- chart, reaction -- and might throw some clarity back on the earlier terms) whenever my PCs (PC-NPC relationship crops up here, if I'm analyzing; 'N' might be a negation, which is interesting; but I could also be distracted by expecting this to mean Personal Computers) want something from an NPC (same term as before, no additional illumination)."<br/><br/>As an outsider I would conclude "this sentence is opaque, using terminology I don't understand.  I can make a guess about a couple of the terms used there.  There are 5 discrete special terms in this sentence."<br/><br/>As an outsider, I would simply not understand this.\n<blockquote>"Man, our session last night was really cool.  I felt like my character was really a protagonist, because we had some really good bangs and we finally got our teeth on Narrativism this session."</blockquote>\n"Man, our session (session, as in a thing you have in psychoanalysis?) last night was realy cool.  I felt like my character (okay, character... this guy's an actor?) was really a protagonist (if I understand basic terms of literary analysis, this term makes sense; if not, it's protago-what?) because we had some really good bangs (sex; gunfights) and we really got our teeth on Narrativism (some strange theory, perhaps, or I could infer narration-ism, i.e., storytelling) this session."<br/><br/>As an outsider I would conclude "this sentence is from some sort of alterna-culture dude into strange psychoanalysis, "role-playing" (in a bedroom sense) sex, and storytelling.  There are five terms in this sentence that make me uncertain about the sentence's meaning."<br/><br/>As an outsider, I would think I understood more of this than I actually did.  I think this sentence while sounding more approachable in some ways, is more vulnerable to being <i>misunderstood</i> without the outsider realizing that he's misunderstanding it.\n<blockquote>Which is more inaccessible to an outsider?  Why?</blockquote>\nOne is "hard" inaccessible -- the first one.  It uses terminology largely in an abbreviated form, using capital letters to denote there are acronyms at work.  The barest of context cues are provided. So it's much like listening to a mechanic talk about the parts of a car engine.<br/><br/>One is "soft" inaccessible -- the second one.  It dresses up like it's more accessible, but it uses terminology that looks like it has plain english meanings but at least in some cases does not mean what I could infer its plain english to mean (e.g., Narrativism, bangs).  This is more like listening to someone talking about, say, the Blowfish encryption algorithm, while thinking they're talking about Blowfish.com, the online sex toy store.<br/><br/>I tend to think the soft inaccessible stuff is more poisonous, because it has a wolf in sheep's clothing effect.  You think you've got a sheep and you get close to it to collect some wool, but then suddenly there are all these sharp teeth at your throat.  The first one at least doesn't pretend to be something it isn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68902/#Comment_68902" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T09:10:17+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  9:10AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>ADDENDUM (edited): At your option, re-write both sentences using as few jargon terms as possible.</blockquote>\nI'm going to rewrite on the supposition that I can use the word "character" and "game" and "dice" without it being a problem.<br/><br/><i>"I hate it when I GM a game because I have to play all the NPCs.  So now I just roll a d20 and look at the reaction chart whenever my PCs want something from an NPC."</i><br/><br/>"I hate it when I'm in charge of a game because I have to take control of all the characters the other players don't.  So now I just roll the dice and look at a table of suggestions whenever the players want something from one of them."  <br/><br/>(In the end, this first sentence is really a pretty simple sentiment.  Sure, it expressed itself in a very codified language, but the concept's actually not that convoluted.)<br/><br/><i>"Man, our session last night was really cool.  I felt like my character was really a protagonist, because we had some really good bangs and we finally got our teeth on Narrativism this session."</i><br/><br/>"Man, that game we played last night was realy cool.  I felt like my character was really the hero of the piece.  The person in charge of running the game put some very good, challenging choices in front of me that were focused on the story of my character.  We finally got our teeth into the story this time around, with everyone's characters having to make some tough choices all around the table.  It's a technique that definitely stepped up the emotional investment in what was going on for my character."<br/><br/>(If I am saying something in my rewrite that doesn't match the jargon used, that's because I don't grasp the jargon correctly... which would only go to further prove my point that this is the sentence that looks easier, but is actually much harder because of the subtleties of meaning dressed up in seemingly plainer language.  Also note that the concepts expressed in this sentence are actually more complex than the first, at least in terms of how I see it; so it's not too surprising that the rewrite is bulkier.)<br/><br/>Judging by how I've experienced these sentences, I'm finding that I at least appreciate "hard" unapproachability, because it presents itself as what it is.  The Forge lexicon (I'm using that term broadly here, it may be inaccurate, but I don't think it's appropriate to drill on that point) is at least "hard" unapproachable when it offers unexplained abbreviations: GNS Theory.  SIS.  <br/><br/>I don't appreciate "soft" unapproachability, because -- to be honest about my *emotional* reaction to it -- it seems to present itself with an attitude of comprehensibility, when it actually is anything but.  It feels dishonest and, in its worst moments, full of itself.  The jargon dresses up as a comprehensible term, but the actual meaning of those terms doesn't match up.  So I start reading it, and I think I get it, and then one of two things happen.  One, I hit a point in the text where I suddenly realize everything I've been assuming the text to mean is probably wrong because a word that seemed clear just got used in a way I don't think it can be.  Or two, I engage with the discussion and get told, rapidly, that I didn't "get it" (those aren't scare quotes, it just seeemed like the best way to format the concept of getting-it).  <br/><br/>Both are very unpleasant experiences for me, so I have tended to instead build up a library of words that people insist on using as something other than what they seem they should mean and try to avoid engaging with -- or even reading -- conversations that make use of them.  A small sampling of terms that have fallen into this box at one point or another in the past:  Any of the three words, spelled out, from GNS (gamism -- that's about rolling dice and moving pieces around a board, right?  narrativism -- that's about liking telling stories, right? simulationism -- that's about, like, applying real world physics to a fight, right?).  Bangs and  Kickers (nearly interchangeable, difficult to tell apart, with "bangs" having a common sense of 'surprises' and "kickers" having a common sense of 'these are big plot twists towards the end of the movie', in terms of how i think of them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68913/#Comment_68913" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T09:37:04+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  9:37AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I assume that this exercise is one in which the author is trying to communicate to an outsider?<br/><br/>Anyway, acronyms are always a little hard for me to get a grasp of, so I often feel like an outsider when I see them.  Sometimes, even ones that I've seen before. I just sort of ignore them and try to figure out the meaning from the context of the rest of the words. In the worst case when I'm feeling lazy, I'll just not worry about them and look at something else. If I'm feeling motivated, I look up the abbreviation. So, the first sentence would probably be a little confusing to me. I remember learning Red Box D&amp;D and the dice abbreviations were hard for me. Now that I'm older, I think I'd get that right away. So, maybe age has something to do with comprehension.<br/><br/>If the first sentence was in a game book, I'd have an easy way to look up the terms in the glossary, so it'd be a none issue. All the terms are simple ones, I think.<br/><br/>In the  second sentence, I think an outsider would have to think that bangs and Narrativism are two really good things that happen in a game, but the terms really don't equal what they mean, so I think an outsider would more easily misunderstand what is being said.<br/><br/>Rewrites:<br/><br/>One: I hate it when I run the game, because I have to play all the extra characters, which consumes a ton of energy. So now instead of coming up with reactions on my own, I just roll the dice and compare the result to the reaction chart for my extra characters to see how they react to the player's desires.<br/><br/>Two: Man, our session last night was really cool. I felt like my character was really a protagonist, because I was presented with some really good choices that forced me to put my character into action. We finally also understood how to create a story using the game's rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68915/#Comment_68915" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T09:42:40+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  9:42AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neither one of them is going to make much sense initially. But the first one is easier to figure out, since the jargon terms are just acronyms that are pretty easy to look up.<br/><br/>If I heard the first statement and wanted to know what it meant, I'd probably start by Googling the terms I didn't understand. "GM" and "PC" probably wouldn't help me much, cause I'd get a zillion hits about personal computers and General Motors, but I'd strike gold with "NPC". Once I figured out that they weren't talking about the National Panhellenic Conference or the National Petroleum Council, I'd get to the Wikepedia article on "Non-player character" and everything would click for me. I'd know we were talking about roleplaying games. I'd have a link to the "gamemaster" article, which would tell me what a GM was, and another one to the "player-character" article, which would clear up PC. In very little time, I'd at least a general idea what they you were talking about.<br/><br/>With the second statement, not so much. Googling "narrativism" gets me a link to a long-ass essay filled with dozens of <i>other</i> jargon terms I don't understand, "protagonist" gets me a bunch of stuff about writing, and "bangs" gets me pictures of hairstyles.<br/><br/>The trouble with the second statement is that the jargon terms <i>sound</i> like regular words, but have specific meanings that are difficult to determine--I know what "narrative" is in literature; every time I <i>think</i> I understand what it means in roleplaying, I end up seeing it used shortly thereafter in a way that indicates that I really <i>don't</i> get it after all.<br/><br/>Jargon is perfectly fine when it's used as shorthand for a concept that everyone agrees with.

I agree people should be more enlightened and always attempt to strive to better themselves, and that IS what you're asking the general public to do on something that is ultimatley a casual pass-time to the average person (Please bear with me on my generalizations.  I am a sociology major so this is focused on groups instead of on individuals).  That being said, the question does not become "is this written for me" rather "does my sentance convey my meaning for those that are in this forum (assuming we're talking about posts)."  This is a perfectly acceptable idea when posting to SG or The Forge but becomes a little more muddled when you enter into large environments like LiveJournal or even RPGnet.  Now, if you're trying to be obscure and not speak to your larger audience, then sure, you're right on target.  But if you're trying to communicate an idea to a community of people not associated with your hobby, and particularly trying to allow them access to that activity you need to be more accessible.<br/><br/>I think what you posted and this point are certainly at the crux of the matter.  there are cross intentions at work here.  I think much confusion about our "jargon" is because someone here talks about what they are doing in a larger environment (many of us have LJ accounts or post APs to RPGnet) or an "outsider" comes and and browses. <br/><br/>As to Ben exercise my take has already been expressed, namely that the first stops most "outsiders" in their tracks.  I think that most people will focus on the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> reaction to the first sentance and either move on to other topics or ask about what they are talking about.  However, the danger of the second sentance (imho) is that a casual reader will come into sentance two and make their own assumptions about what is meant and not persue the disussion further.  They THINK they understand it.  Then they go onto other forums and speak from what they assume is an informed vocabulary.<br/><br/>Thus miscommunication ensues.  The second sentance does not really allow that disconnect and the reader doesn't realize that it's "not posted for him."  In some strange way doesn't that make the first set of jargon more successful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68922/#Comment_68922" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T09:58:57+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  9:58AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2007 10:14AM by Christian_Griffen.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"I hate it when I GM a game because I have to play all the NPCs.

That said, the reason I think the former is less inaccessible is because the terms used don't correlate to normal English terms -- if you look up "GM," "NPC," or "d20" in a dictionary, you won't find them listed.  So, either you ignore that statement or you have to ask someone what those terms mean -- there doesn't seem to be as much room for assumption.<br/><br/>Contrast with the second sentence, there's plenty of room for assumption because those are all words that we're generally either familiar with or can look up on M-W.com.  So there's a lot more room for putting your own definition of some jargon word in that sentence.  Sadly, this very element makes the second <i>feel</i> more accessible, because of the lack of non-acronym, non-English-word jargon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68928/#Comment_68928" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:09:06+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:09AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2007 10:11AM by jhkim.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>EDIT:</b> <i>Edited to try to fix the formatting.

I'd phrase it like:<br/><br/><i>I hate it when I'm in a game where I have to act out a lot of different characters.

There's an element to the second jargon set -- in terms of its "youth" and "penetration" -- that keep it from being an apples to apples comparison.  But that's part of my problem with the young terminology.  I think it's trying to be comprehensible, but only manages achieving the <i>appearance </i>of comprehensibility, and that's where some pretty nasty tensions can arise in conversations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68942/#Comment_68942" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:30:07+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>This is a perfectly acceptable idea when posting to SG or The Forge but becomes a little more muddled when you enter into large environments like LiveJournal or even RPGnet.

You shouldn't use jargon when you're talking to people who don't understand the jargon.  If I was posting to RPGnet (if I could overcome the seizures that ensue whenever I try to keep up with that place), I wouldn't use jargon, because it's inappropriate and I wouldn't actually be communicating.  However, here?  Here I use (light) jargon.  My game design blog?  I use (heavy) jargon.  Because here and in my own blog, I'm not trying to proselytize to the masses.  If I ever proselytize, it's in my own games, or maybe in ad copy for those games -- and in neither place will you ever find theory jargon, because, well, that would be stupid.<br/><br/>However, every time I see a thread bitching about the prevalence of jargon, what I hear is, "I don't understand what's happening and I can't take it upon myself to become fluent in the language used on this community that I want to join.  YOU ALL should modify your practice to accomodate ME."  Which is bogus.<br/><br/>And that's what bothers me about Ben's exercise, here.  We're not taking context into account.  We can't gauge which one is "more clear" because clarity is inherently dependent on context.  Quite frankly, the first one is less clear to me because I don't know what "reaction chart" the hypothetical guy is referring to.  But that is, in the end, irrelevant.  It certainly doesn't prove that jargon is useful, which shouldn't be a question -- of course it's useful, otherwise humanity wouldn't use it in a thousand different settings throughout its history.  What this exercise does miss, however, is that jargon is only useful <em>in its proper context</em>, which is where the complaints start, because people don't realize that they're in a different context than their familiar everyday setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68948/#Comment_68948" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:42:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:42AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's interesting that some people have said that the second example would be appropriate for Story Games.

I think that, some defensiveness aside, this was pretty darned clear.<br/><br/>My thoughts: On writing the sentences, I realized that these two jargons are opaque in very, very different ways.  (This is going to mirror a lot of other people's responses, too.)  The first is very technical.  Every removing the abbreviations (the words were abbreviated because that's how everyone writes them on this forum), terms like "game master," "player character," and "non-player character" are totally impenetrable to an outsider.  You need serious context to be able to get a grip on them.<br/><br/>Contrariwise, the Forge terms are quasi-jargon.  They largely look like other words.  They have clear antecedents, and it's possible to guess at their meaning just from hearing them.  They function much more cleanly in a sentence, by and large.<br/><br/>Which is better?  Which is worse?  I'm going to think about it more below.<br/><br/>Thoughts on responses:  A lot of people took this at total face value, and that was awesome!  I was expected a lot more noise and a lot less signal in the responses here, and it's really a great surprise to see otherwise.<br/><br/>That said: I'm kinda bemused at the "any weekend role-player!" responses, I have to say.  When we're talking about other topics, "the hobby" is shrinking, dying and desperately needs new players.  When we're talking directly about accessibility of language, suddenly there's role-players everywhere.<br/><br/>2) Have everyone, since we all use technical jargon, think critically about how outsiders are going to perceive technical jargon when it's used in front of them, and what sort of reactions that they might have.<br/><br/>My thoughts:<br/><br/>When approaching the first sentence, my instinct as an outsider is just to give up and go away, unless there's some pressing reason why I should want to understand it at all.  It's totally unapproachable.  I don't have a clue what the guy is talking about, and my reaction is going to be just to move along.<br/><br/>With the other one, it's very different.  Because the roots of the words are more obvious to me, it's possible for me to construct an idea of what he's saying in my head, even if that idea is totally wrong.  So, it's not just "blahblahblah" it's actually words, kinda.<br/><br/>Now, here's the place where things break down.  I, Ben, in this situation (and provided that there's any interest) will start asking about what things mean.  "So, by, wifflfish, you mean ..?"  But, this behavior has totally been trained in me by talking on the Forge.  Pre-Forge Ben would totally just assume that he'd gotten the words from context, jump into the conversation, and use them to mean what he thought they should mean.<br/><br/>Thoughts on responses: Ironically, not a single person imagined that an uninitiated person would lose their shit and demand that everyone explain what the hell they were talking about or they must be elitist assholes who can't speak or write.  I guess we're all picturing a very low-key listener.<br/><br/>3) Rewriting.  This was Fred's idea, I'll let him speak to the purposes.<br/><br/>"I hate it when all of my friends have gathered together and we're playing a game which is also sort of an improvisational acting exercise and sort of like Dungeons and Dragons but not, and I'm the one who is appointed to hold all of the mechanical and fictional authority, except when other people get really angry at me and threaten to break down the game, because in those circumstances it's necessary for me to portray and make decisions for all the characters that occupy the fictional world that we're creating / imagining via our play of this game, excepting those few characters that the other players have been given authority for, most of the time.  So now whenever those characters who the other players have been given authority for, most of the time wants to interact with another character that I have authority for, most of the time, I just roll a twenty-sided die, which is an odd shaped sort of die that you use to play these sorts of games, or at least some of these sorts of games, and using the result of that die roll I consult a table which lists different possible attitudes emotional reactions, and just use that random result to inform that character's reaction to the other character's action."<br/><br/>"Man, last night when we got together to mutually contribute to a story mediated a game-like mechanical structure, I had a really good time.  I felt like the character in our shared story that I was given authority to make decisions for really came into his own as a protagonist, and that I was able to make, via that character, some really key decisions about the course of our story and the over-all fiction of the game, and my input was really recognized.  The reason that I got to do this was because one or more of the other players had thought of fictional situations in which my character had to make immediate and important decisions, and those decisions definitely had an impact over the rest of play.  We finally got our teeth into the core purpose of what we're playing, which is to actively engage with the fiction as co-creators responsible for the outcome of the fictional events, rather than as passive audience to a pre-planned structure."<br/><br/>You may disagree with some of my use of the terms in the first sentence.  This is because these terms mean different things to different people (and in different games) and I had to make a decision about which explanation to use.<br/><br/>More analysis in a bit.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68955/#Comment_68955" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:54:33+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:54AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of these jargon threads are really a way of saying: "Who the heck is Story Games created by, and created for?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68960/#Comment_68960" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T11:08:14+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 11:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, given that jargon isn't going to be intuitively comprehensible (which, frankly, it will never be) is it better to have and use jargon which is unaccessible (like in sentence #1) or psuedo-accessible (like in sentence #2)?<br/><br/>I think each has it's weaknesses and strengths.  Here's my take on those -- others feel free to disagree, as this is not well thought out and written off the cuff.<br/><br/>The weaknesses of unaccessible jargon are that it is forbidding to most people and it creates a very steep learning curve to be able to participate in discussion at all.  I think that this leads to a culture of cliquishness and insularity (I see this in science fields, also) and a general mistrust of outsiders.  Eventually, this becomes totally un-examined use of jargon all the time, which is a problem especially when the mean of the jargon words varies locally.<br/><br/>I hadn't thought about this before now, but: When people talk about making role-playing more accessible, they never talk about language.  Why not?  It seems like a very obvious place to start with the accessibility.<br/><br/>The strength of inaccessible jargon is that it is considerably less prone to being misunderstood and also somewhat less frustrating, because you either learn it or you don't: It's very hard to get it wrong.<br/><br/>The biggest weakness of pseudo-accessible jargon is that it is prone to being misunderstood and, furthermore, these misunderstandings are prone to spreading, because someone who misunderstands the term will think that they understand it, and will then go on to "teach" this misunderstanding to others.  Other weaknesses are that people will get more easily confused by the terms (because they aren't as clearly identifiable as specialized jargon terms) and that trying to learn the intended meanings of them can be quite difficult, because there are other associations (accurate or not as they are) with the words and those need to be unlearned, which is frustrating as all get out.<br/><br/>The advantage of pseudo-accessible terms is that, often, someone without a lot of context can get a pretty good idea about what's being talked about, even if they don't pick up all the details.  Also, they're much easier to learn (because the more ordinaryish words serve a mnemonics) and integrate much more naturally into the flow of language.<br/><br/>Other thoughts on this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68961/#Comment_68961" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T11:15:38+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 11:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2007 11:18AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben, I think to a certain degree I think the main concern Kynn and others are settled on is that it's not just easy to guess the meanings of the words in the second example, it's very easy to guess <i>completely wrong.</i> So it sounds like you've nailed it.<br/><br/>I won't get too deeply into it, (loudly, repetitiously) disbelieving as I do in a goodly chunk of Forge theory - it would be more decorous for someone who does believe in it to address the point.

Precision of discussion in these terms is highly valued in the community where they came from.

Nobody has a monopoly on "the truth" about these concepts, except in so far as you can point to the history of their development. The G and the N and the S do have a meaning. It's in the essays. The "madness" is because some other people have a feeling of <i>ownership</i> over those terms, and thus insist that they cannot, ever, in any context, mean what they mean within the Big Model context.<br/><br/>If I were calculatedly planning what terms to use for those concepts, would I have picked ones that were susceptible to that dispute of ownership/meaning? Well, ideally, no. But that's the trouble with language. Words already mean things. Just making up nonsense words is exclusionary (Type 1) - and makes talking clearly difficult. Adopting words or making portmanteaus subjects us to confusion and authority struggles (Type 2 exclusion).<br/><br/>I fully believe that if the Big Model contained the three creative agendas of Kamfutter, Mubiloid, and Bwertz, we'd still have these arguments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68972/#Comment_68972" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T12:07:33+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 12:07PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most accessibility discussions about RPGs I've seen have focused on:<br/>1) Fictional content (If we had soap-opera games old women would buy them)<br/>2) Systematic concerns (non gamer people like games without a lot of GM fiat, non gamer people like rules light games, whatever.)<br/>3) Presentation (if it's in a box, non gamer people will buy it!)<br/><br/>And only then language.<br/><br/>But this is a tangent to the thread.

But if I start reading that thread and run headlong into two or more people debating what the meaning of the jargon is -- or worse yet, presenting different/conflicting definitions for it -- I find that I simply assume that <i>all of them</i> are wrong and that I could live a more happy and fulfilled life if I never bothered trying to find the hidden needle of meaning buried under their haystack of nonsense.<br/><br/><br/>So while Mark W undoubtedly has a point about things like "G/N/S" jargon not really having any specific ownership in reality, I sometimes think things would be better if they did.  The fuzzier the edges on these words, the more people will find their own interpretation of them, and the less useful discussions involving those words become.  On the other hand, the type of jargon you see in the first example in the first post of this thread suggests that words with very specific meanings, like "reaction chart" or "PC," don't inspire any discussion <i>at all</i>.  The concepts they describe are so well-defined that there just isn't much to say about 'em.<br/><br/>The most fun jargon from a forum-reading perspective seems to be the kind that's just vague enough to encourage discussion and just rigid enough to keep that discussion from devolving into a holy war over semantics (which inevitably conceals whatever points anyone is hoping to make in the clutter of "I'm right, you're wrong" shouting).  Unfortunately, I can't think of any examples of jargon that fits that particular description; and when you're trying to play a game or explain how to play to someone else, I'd have to say that the more explicitly defined a word is, the better.  I don't <i>want</i> discussion about what a word means when I'm trying to get a game started, I just want to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69274/#Comment_69274" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T11:34:21+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 11:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>"Accounting for Taste" has a good point. There's not much of a problem with jargon in general. Human beings a animals that speak, and they will make up new words and phrases to use when speaking. And, when confronted with a new word they haven't heard before, they will try to figure it out, or ask. They only get frustrated when there doesn't seem to be a way to figure a word out, or a way to get a correct definition, or when the people using the new word throw up artificial barriers and act like "gatekeepers" to some kind of mystery.</p>\n<p>Much of the jargon and slang used around here isn't that bad, because it's based on firm visual metaphors or analogies to something most people are familiar with. The problems, I would argue, come from jargon that isn't firmly grounded in a visual metaphor or an analogy.  This mainly seems to happen when the jargon refers to people's intentions or goals -- in other words, stuff you can never really experience. That's why GNS is so problematic: ultimately, they are terms for why people do what they do, and since you can never really know that, people get into arguments about why some people do X, or which intentions or desires are the fundamental ones that all others are mere shadows of. That's also why Push and Pull have become problematic: it started as a simple analogy to indian wrestling, a way of creating changes in fiction by applying force or creating a spot for force to move into, but it later picked up a lot of baggage about what people's intentions are, and things became murkier.</p>\n<p>In the examples Ben gave at the top of the thread, the first example is pretty impenetrable to an outsider, even if the abbreviations are expanded, but all the jargon words ultimately refer to observable procedures or objects, so the jargon is relatively easy to learn.</p>\n<p>In the second example, "session" is technically jargon, but it is used almost identical to the way it's used in (a) music recording, (b) therapy, (c) education, and (d) a court of law, so an outsider overhearing someone talking about their "game session" won't know exactly what that entails, but will get the basic concept immediately. The word "protagonist" is similarly coined by analogy to a literary protagonist, but that's not as well-known a word; anyone who has taken college-prep English in high school or read actual film criticism will know it, but there are plenty of outsiders who won't know the term. Furthermore, some gamers use the term "protagonist" with a little extra baggage: it's not just the hero of the story or the person who makes the plot happen, but it also involves whatever the player of that character <em>intended</em> to happen to that character -- and the murk creeps in, slightly. "Bangs" is opaque in the same way that "NPC" is opaque and certainly has a smaller community of usage, but it's just an onomatopoetic name for something grounded in observable behavior, so it's not murky, like the deceptive "protagonist" or the last jargon word "Narrativism", which is definitely tainted with concerns about intention.</p>\n<p>So, not only is the second example easier to misunderstand by an <em>outsider</em>, it's 50% easier for more experienced members of the community to disagree over.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3022/jargon-an-exercise" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3022/jargon-an-exercise" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3022/jargon-an-exercise/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3022%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3022%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
