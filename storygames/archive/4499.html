Basically, it's a forge-style game where you roll dice or move chips or whatever, with lots of gamey aspects.<br/><br/>So many gamey aspects, that narration doesn't really have to happen at all. You could play the game from end to end without really roleplaying. Roleplaying, then, is just "parlor narration". The rules say, "Now you have to roleplay!" but in reality, no, no you do not: You could completely get rfom one end of the game to the other without ever speaking once in character.<br/><br/>There aren't any published games like this, I don't think. But a lot emerge in things like the Game Chef competition. It's one of the criticisms against fiddly nar games with lots of gamey elements: It can look fun as hell, but then you realize that roleplaying doesn't have to happen. That's "parlor narration".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101922/#Comment_101922" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T09:22:03+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  9:22AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>I always thought parlor game implied that the mechanics were facile enough to play with a mixed group of people at least some of whom aren't gamers.</blockquote>\nThat was sort of what I thought as well, but more specifically a smallish LARP-like game able to be played in one's living room without a lot of fuss in terms of prep.<br/><br/>My understanding of the term was also in reference to the low prep Parlor LARP's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101923/#Comment_101923" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T09:22:33+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  9:22AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah: Parlor games are the ones where you can play in a bar or wherever.

If you can play it at a Bar Mitzvah, the lounge at a Gay Club, or in the cafeteria at Tomorrowland at Disney World, it's a Parlor Game.<br/><br/>Parlor Narration, though, is different.

My understanding of Ron's use of the term is this: <br/><br/>There were a rash of games and proto-games, many during the Ronnies, that got so excited about narration techniques (like in PTA or Dust Devils, for examples) that they went out and did it themselves. The problem is, what they did was to create mechanics that, when you looked at everything boiled down, all they did was figure out who talks. That was it. There was no connection to the fictional events of the game. The characters were basically unchanged. The mechanics didn't force any significant choices upon the players via their characters. Etc. <br/><br/>It was "narration trading" and that's about it in the case of these games. Ron viewed this as a great failure of design for these games. I did too, not least of all because I fell into the trap myself with Red Rain!<br/><br/>I think Ron meant that these were like "Parlour Games" as in, games a bunch of old farts used to play in the parlour to entertain themselves, things like the Dictionary game or whatever. Sorta of like draw a piece of paper with words on it out of a hat and talk.

You can see it here:<br/><a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Baihua.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Baihua.php</a><br/><br/>Now, it's been like 2 years since I looked at it, and it may have changed since. Actually, I just opened it and I think it's the same. Give it a look, you'll understand at a glance what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>But at the time, you played the game: You had a board. You moved to regions in China. You rolled on a chart to determine what the issue was.

My entry to the Sight &amp; Sound competition (<i>kalma</i>) drew a lot from Remi Treur's improv interviews on <i>Have Games, Will Travel </i>. One of the things I wanted to to was divorce player effectiveness from character effectivenes. The system will carry on and you will run out of steam no matter what it is you do as a player. It's a gloomy (but hopefully interesting) end.<br/><br/>I still don't understand <i>quite</i> how some games (like D&amp;D) aren't parlor games. My descriptions of a sword-swing don't change my effectivess. My motivations as a player don't matter in social mechanics.

The scenarios were distinctive in that they were made for 8 people, and playable entirely within a single room, and were ready-to-play out of the box (as it were) within a few hours, with detachable character sheets.  <br/><br/>cf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlor_game" rel="nofollow"><b>Parlor Game</b></a> in Wikipedia, and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_game" rel="nofollow"><b>Party Game</b></a> for comparison.  Personally, I think that a parlor game or party game can also be a fully functional role-playing game.  There's nothing incompatible in the definitions that I can see.  The common features of a parlor game as I see it are: (1) played indoors in a single room; (2) play can be started up with an arbitrary group of people - i.e. you could gather some people together and pull out a parlor game; (3) the game is completed within a reasonably short time - 3-4 hours maximum, I'd say.  <br/><br/>So How to Host a Murder mysteries and Parlor LARPs are both workable parlor games.  So would Best Friends or 1001 Nights.<br/><br/><i>Edited to fix links</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102000/#Comment_102000" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T12:20:04+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 12:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Joe, maybe looking at the two games of mine that I name-checked would be instructive.  In both cases you can play the whole thing without interacting at all.  There's just "step 39a:  roleplay" tucked in there.  They'd also make really weak board games.  <br/><br/>Here's what Ron said when he <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19156.0" rel="nofollow">coined the term</a> (I think he coined it):<br/><br/>"These games raise an interesting issue. They are essentially "I get to say what the dice tell me" procedures, organized into specific scenes and what-to-roll rituals. Unfortunately, this is not an SIS-generating procedure, any more than putting on a funny hat and voice when playing Monopoly is role-playing. These games are entirely too structured in terms of what a character "is," imaginatively speaking, and more generally, what "can happen" during play. In contrast with fairly ritualized games like My Life with Master and Polaris, I think these are marked by a complete inability for characters actually to do stuff outside the immediate instructions of the rules, up to and including making crucial choices about relationships with other characters.<br/><br/>Which begs the question, however, of whether these games work. Mechanically, they well might, in the sense that gears will shift and cogs will revolve. Imaginatively and motivationally? That will be a very, very local question, and my judgment at this point is that all of these entries have gone over a crucial line, to the point where the role of human input is restricted only to the end-process of resolution, too much so for it to play a conflict-generating role.<br/><br/>The good news is that none of them suck. I think all of them could well be brought back over that crucial boundary into the zone that I think yields successful play, with a conceptual modification, mostly affecting when Fortune is applied and how scenes may be constructed.

This kind of game is often the most direct route to shared creativity <br/><br/>it's only a problem if you are primarily interested in some other goals- like role-playing the character in such as way as to identify with their {forge narrativist style} issues; or to highlight conflicts between characters. Then there may not be enough contact between players or feedback between the system and the story to nudge the game towards those latter goals<br/><br/>as someone who likes these kinds of parlor narration structures I will say that they tend to be better in short to medium length doses. Successful play will depend on good inspirations/constraints getting players to think of cool narration. Once everyone has had a few turns, you'll tend to get a diminishing return on creativity                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102023/#Comment_102023" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T13:12:49+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:12PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Here's a question:  are games where the characters (at least, central PC-like characters) are naturally equally skilled at<i>everything</i>-- from washing a car to turning into a dragon to crushing a sun to, well,<i>literally everything</i>-- pre-disposed to parlor narration?

(oh wait, no link: Here's Terra Nova: <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Terra_Nova.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Terra_Nova.pdf</a> )<br/><br/>We're talking games where you do this:<br/><br/>You have Discipline, Hope and Strength, which can become Madness Despair and Helplessness.<br/>Pull a card and give it to someone. Based on that card you either have:<br/>Exhaustion<br/>Frostbite, or<br/>Doubt.<br/>*Roleplay getting Exhaustion, Frostbite, or Doubt*<br/>Then you ahve a hardship or crisis. Pull another card. When you pull this card, you either<br/>succeed or<br/>break down or<br/>die<br/>...in a very specific way. And the people involved in the crisis are determined by which cards are drawn.<br/>Also, the nature of the crisis is determined by the cards.<br/>* Roleplay your Set Crisis with the Set People, and then roleplay how you Succeeded or Died, all of which have been pretty much determined already*<br/><br/>Now, the above is pretty accurate give-or-take, but it shows how basically the players control... jack and shit. They, as players, simply get to roleplay the above set-determined things that the cards decide.<br/><br/>That's the equivalent of getting together with friends and reading out Shakespeare scripts. It can be fun! But there's really no room for that explorative roleplaying stuff (other than "acting out your part"): All the decisions, color, effects, etc are determined by the cards or dice. You just get to say how it happens in a funny accent.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>I still don't understand<i>quite</i>how some games (like D&amp;D) aren't parlor games.</blockquote>\nI'm assuming here that again you mean parlor <b>narration</b>, right?<br/><br/>It's because the player has choices: They can go in the dungeon or they could dig around town (give or take railroads, illusionism, etc). They can gang up on the beholder first, or pick off its minions first. They can choose their tactics in combat, and when the adventure is over they get to decide what to do with their treasure.<br/><br/>A D&amp;D parlor narration game would look like this:<br/><br/>"You are all in front of the dungeon. The dungeon is dark. You are going in because (roll the dice: on 1-2 you are an adventurer looking for gold, on 3-4 you are getting money to help someone you love, on 5-6 you are going in to ward off self doubt). Have one scene where all players describe the dungeon's entry room.<br/><br/>Then count your Happiness chips. If you own 3+ happiness chips, you succeed. You get the gold. Roleplay getting the gold. Quickly.<br/>If you have less than 3 happiness chips, you fail. You don't get the gold. Because you didn't get the gold, you feel:<br/>1 Spiritual pain<br/>2-4 Ennui<br/>5 Mental anguish<br/>6 Confidence in the next adventure<br/>Have one quick scene where you roleplay the above feelings.<br/><br/>Then you meet back in the tavern."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102024/#Comment_102024" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T13:14:23+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:14PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron'll probably jump down my throat for putting words in his mouth, but I don't think he was saying that these games aren't potentially fun.
