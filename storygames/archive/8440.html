If its not a vaule judgement the balance of good vs bad should go both ways, so please help me with my bad wrong think. <br/><br/>logos                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186572/#Comment_186572" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:32:21+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:32AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have an issue with something one person posted, you might want to work it out in private (email offline, whispers, etc).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186580/#Comment_186580" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:42:14+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:42AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course passive, reactive and uncreative play is not "inferior". What would that even mean?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it might be that those qualities make that sort of play unuseful for a given purpose. Functionally the wrong choice, wrong tool for what you're trying to achieve. I don't see why I should need to prove that passive, reactive and uncreative play would be better for something specific, though - it's enough to analytically demonstrate that those are qualities of technique and not of goals, and therefore claiming anything but functional value for them is a category error. Therefore we can claim that play like that is nonfunctional for a purpose, but we can't claim that it is inferior.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you insist, here is an example of superior play: when we play <i>Heroquest</i>, that old boardgame, play that is passive, reactive and uncreative is superior compared to play that does not have one of these qualities. Passive play beats active because you don't want to activate more than one room of monsters at a time. Reactive play beats active because you don't want to play out of turn - you only act when the rules require you to, not whenever the mood strikes you. Uncreative play is better than creative - and this is actually a crucial practical point in my experience - because playing Heroquest "creatively" seems to always lead to the game morphing into some sort of semi-roleplaying and resultant rules arguments. Better to just follow the rules and not think about it too hard, as that sort of outright drift doesn't lead to anything satisfactory.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, those are just matters of technique. If your goal in the game is to have players who don't act too unexpectedly, it seems like a fine idea to instruct them to act passively, reactively and in uncreative manner. I've met several GMs through the years for whom these are the best players they could hope for. It's not at all far-fetched.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186583/#Comment_186583" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:44:33+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:44AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It should be noted that not everyone in the group can be passive and reactive - someone has to take the lead in putting things out there.

And note that "passive" and "reactive" are opposites - groups are not passive to the extent that they react more enthusedly, creatively, etc. to situations and elements of the game.

In fact, it was key to my gaming up until I took up with my current group and it took me a good three or four sessions to get used to not having stuff rammed down my throat but instead having to put stuff into the game.  Interestingly enough, I sat in on a game with my old group and since I left it has gotten even more passive and uncreative.  In fact, there's this hideous culture whereby the GM tells you what your character feels and vetoes any actions he thinks are 'out of character'.  He also has a big hand in deciding what you should and should not play.  My thinking on the matter is that the GM in question should take up writing short fiction.<br><br>In many ways I'm more of a traditionalist than many when it comes to GM power but I really do draw the line at being told "but your character woudn't do that".<br/><br/>As for passive and reactive play, I think it's what people are used to.  I know for ages it didn't occur to me that I could say "actually we're not going to do that.  We're getting on a plane to Ibiza and checking out the clubs" and for a while after that it struck me as a player being a dick and wanting to derrail the game in order to make it about what he wants it to be about.  It's like inverse railroading.<br/><br/>Also worth bearing in mind is the role played by a desire to be non-confrontational.  I know in America people are raised in a therapy-friendly culture where you're constantly compelled to "talk about it" and "get it out, it's eating you alive" but in truth a lot of people are a lot happier not 'talking about it' and as long as the game is just entertaining enough, they'll keep coming back.<br/><br/>As for uncreative, I'm not sure what that means.  Lots of people run epic fantasy which is recycled shit based on recycled shit based on recycled shit based on Tolkien. I'd call that pretty uncreative.<br/><br/>And regarding something being inferior I think that's stacking the deck.  Getting a blowjob is superior to yawning your way through a dungeon crawl with a bunch of retards you barely like but it's not as though people get up in the morning and say "shall I get a blowjob or go back to that Dragonlance game?"  A lot of factors influence how people think about their gaming or any other kind of leisure activity and I think that it's reductive to go "X is better than Y, why would you not want to play X?"                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186586/#Comment_186586" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:47:31+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, "passive" and "uncreative" are pretty perjorative on their own. "Reactive" less so, but still. I can think of several contexts in which this sort of play -- rephrased with hopefully positive and not perjorative language -- is better:<br/><br/>* Strongly GM-led play with a clear vision being delivered by an auteur type GM works very well with players who want to go along on the GM's ride. Trying to bring too much player-level authorship into the game will interfere with this vision so is therefore an inferior style of play.<br/><br/>* Tactically minded players often prefer to react to challenges, rather than actively pursuing a plan of action.<br/><br/>* There's a whole realm of tourism-style play that's as far away from story-gaming as SGing is from trad RPing. That is probably the pinnacle of reactive-slash-passive, uncreative play. I mean, yeah, there's some baseline creativity required to visualize the tour the GM is taking you on, but it's not active imagination. It's more like TV without the CRT.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186597/#Comment_186597" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T11:04:28+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 11:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            here is an example of the transition from passive to active. One of my players totally lit up when he realized that he could intersect his character into a scene without me the GM inviting him in. This didn't mean he had no-fun, or badwrongfun before I distributed this little bit of narrative control. It just meant that he trusted me to ensure that he would get his spotlight time. In many ways passive here was stronger than active because it involved a level of trust, from him to me. He, as a player, had to give this to me. Just like I had to learn to give this to him, for him to take the step from active to passive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt changed our way of gaming. It changed our way of having fun. It didn't change the fact that we had fun. Thus the lack of value judgement.It is just two different ways of having fun. Now we alternate between the two ways depending on where the ficiton is going and what we kind of gaming we are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with reactive. Reactive is I create a situation, the players react. I then have the game world react to what their characters did and we have the whole react -react-react cycle going until that local situation is resolved. nothing negative about that. At the same time we may have one or two players being proactive (active) in that they themselves create or provoke situations for their characters or the group. One player in my group was an expert at doing this inconspiciously. Again no value judgement in that word. Again an exchange of trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see uncreative as a word ruffle some feathers. Again it is all about a playstyle where you as the player for instance sin't expected to intorduce NPCs or other setting elements. Where your participation is limited to your characters actions/reactions. Sounds harsher than it really is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186598/#Comment_186598" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T11:11:29+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 11:11AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah..."uncreative" is still not exactly right, because you can be extremely creative within the boundaries set, sometimes very tight boundaries.

So while they might not go out of their way to Create Situation themselves or take the reigns in steering the core events of the story, as soon as the GM (or another player) presents something to them, like an obstacle, it's like BAM! Roleplay Squad Roll Out! - Creating plans, getting into character, creating enough character content to basically carry the entire rest of the session, even.<br><br>This is opposed to Active, which is where the GM maybe steps back with forceful plots, and expects the players to jump in and create situations which drive the rest of the session.<br><br>The other kind of Reactive is when you have a kind of unresponsive single player (or more) who enjoy the game they are playing, but they don't seem to do Anything At All. In other words, in the above Reactive situation, where all the other players explode into action to react to that situation, there's still the one guy (or more?) who still doesn't move that much. If their character is addressed, they'll reply. If they're forced into a situation, they'll do just enough to get out of it. But beyond that, they can be corpselike. <br/>(this isn't just about people, mind: Sometimes depending on mood, tiredness etc any player can fall into this for a single session and the like). I've been in a few games with people like this, and it can be really hard to pull them into the game, which is where the fun is for me, as a player. <br/>*note: This might be what's referred to as "Turtling", but I'm not entirely sure.<br/><br/>Hope that makes sense, this idea of the "two kinds of uses for 'Reactive' here in gaming". Still not quite formed in my head, tho.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186611/#Comment_186611" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T11:38:52+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 11:38AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the same way that hammers are very bad cameras, "reactive" play is very bad "active" play.<br/><br/>They're just not the same thing at all. There really should be a better terminology (I tend to go with labeling the two relationships to the imagined content as "creator" and "fan", but that has its own problems and likely speaks more to my own background and obsessions on this topic than anything).<br/><br/>It's important to keep in mind that players in the so-called "passive" mode may be very actively engaged and doing creative stuff - they're just doing it within tightly bounded, fairly scripted social expectations. They color in the GM's drawing.<br/><br/>Do you want to experience the fiction, or do you want to make the fiction?<br/><br/>Advantages of "Fan" play include:<br/><br/>1. Immersion-facilitating<br/>2. You can coast if you want to or you're low energy - the GM will take up the slack<br/>3. Single coherent vision - fewer "bumps" in resolution<br/>4. System (sort of) Doesn't Matter - except with regard to technical preferences<br/>5. Less vulnerability - players are not expected to expose their own creations/ideas to potential criticism or ridicule<br/>6. Accessibility - much easier to just jump in and participate... just follow your prompts!<br/>7. Very popular - easy to find compatible players/groups<br/><br/>Disadvantages of "Creator" play include:<br/><br/>1. Clash/mis-synch of creative visions<br/>2. High commitment, high demand of engagement at all times<br/>3. More likely to interfere with immersion for many players<br/>4. You will be judged<br/>5.

Recently life pressures have made everyone I game with Fans and I have felt the pressure on me increase with some negative consequences (I get ranty at them more often).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186615/#Comment_186615" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T11:59:54+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 11:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like fan/creator, but it still has too much of a dichotomy for me. In plenty of reactive games that I've run, for example, players are expected to come up with a backstory for their character, sometimes quite detailed ones with lots of new elements in it. It's a sliding scale. Feng Shui, for example, urges all players to insert relatively minor physical details into scenes in order to promote crazy fight scenes, but any big changes that fully change the situation are still the province of the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186628/#Comment_186628" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T12:31:31+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 12:31PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, <br/><br/>The Feng Shui note is a good one. Of course, in most games there are also all sorts of rules about what, or how, the GM creates new things too. <br/><br/>I mean, if I say your character is walking down the street and its a lovely day and I ask what you're doing and you say "getting flowers" and I say "Oh, well since you didn't dodge the Dragon eats you" you may well ask "what fucking dragon" and I'm not going to really be justified in saying "The dragon that I just created." <br/><br/>In every RPG there are social, procedural, genre, and mechanical rules about who can say what, when, and how much of it sticks. Just because some games slide the part that players can say down to a narrower channel doesn't mean that they're inherently wrong, or uncreative. It just means that the creative aspect of the game is focused to specific types at specific moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186647/#Comment_186647" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T13:37:46+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  1:37PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 1:39PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>The other kind of Reactive is when you have a kind of unresponsive single player (or more) who enjoy the game they are playing, but they don't seem to do Anything At All.</blockquote>\nI don't mean to be a pedant here, but there's already a word for that kind of reactive: passive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186653/#Comment_186653" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T14:02:24+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  2:02PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 2:03PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find this quite interesting.<br/><br/>Like Jason (Corley), I don't see this is as a dichotomy. Rather, I see it as a pie chart.<br/><br/>To create a fictional story, series of events, or narrative dialogue (or whatever you want to call it), someone has to talk. <i>Blah blah blah blah</i> -- there is the story. Whether the individual <i>blahs</i> are "I forgive her" and "the dragon enters the city" or "I move my token one step forward" and "I choose to take the Full Defense option", there is a series of events taking place. All together, they make up the game and/or the story you're making together.<br/><br/>Someone has to provide each "blah": open their mouth, make a decision, do something. But we can break that up however we like. We can say one person does all the talking, the others just listen. That's Bob telling a story to his friends--passive, from our perspective. We can say we each provide one "blah", an equal slice of the pie--we're all active and creative now. We can say that Bob talks, but he can also prompt one of us when he wants us to say something. That's reactive, from our perspective.<br/><br/>For different styles of gaming, we'll break up that total pie in different ways. Maybe the GM is telling 60% of the story, and we each get 10%. Or maybe we each get equal parts.<br/><br/>I think it doesn't matter whether the way we slice the pie is "you talk for five minutes, I talk for five minutes" or "I handle the actions of three monsters, and you get three actions per round for you Warrior Princess".<br/><br/>So, each person is talking a certain portion of the time. And I think that, as long as no one is being mislead, any way you want to slice that pie is OK.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call "listen to Bob tell his story" roleplaying any more than I would call "let's play Chess, but I play for my side AND for your side" playing a game, but, maybe, if you get even one move now and then, and you're happy with that, everyone can have a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186682/#Comment_186682" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T16:23:10+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  4:23PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>So please proove me wrong, how can Passive, Uncreative, Reactive Play be supierior to Active, Creative, play.

In many games in fact I suspect that having control over narrative plot-arc sort of things is really less creative input than is normally required to describe talking to an NPC or going shopping in the city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186788/#Comment_186788" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T07:55:22+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  7:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a lot of games that are played with the "creator GM, reactive player" model in mind, the game text prescribes a minimum amount of work - much of it pre-play - that a player needs to do to make the game function. If players come to the table with a legal character, and the GM comes with a bare-bones adventure, the game will work. It won't generate much color, or many twists, but it will function. Creativity is a value-add, and it generally has specified places where it's supposed to be allowed and not allowed.<br/><br/>This is one of the criticisms that's repeatedly leveled at games under the "rollplay" umbrella, but I actually feel that a game that is playable and fun in the stereotypical zero-creativity "rollplay" mode as one that's probably GREAT for "fan" play - because it demands little, but permits much.<br/><br/>It's also worth talking about where creativity happens. A lot of creativity in "fan" play is color. You can add color all you like, but don't touch the resolution of events. "Roleplaying" (the shorthand a lot of players use for this outside-the-formal-rules creativity on the part of players) is what happens in between the conflicts that drive changes in situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186825/#Comment_186825" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T10:02:33+00:00" title="January  8, 2009 10:02AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it really interesting the effort to seperate uncreative from not actively creative and other simular distinctions. <br/><br/>I also find rather disingenious to suggest that because neither the original thread or I put in some sort objective standard that none apply. If anything we are swimming in objective standards in life, where passive, reactive, and Not actively creative are disvalued. <br/><br/>If you are a member of a group where people are passive , reactive and not actively creative in the work sphere your likely to be miffed at those people, and for pretty good reason, I don't see how this is terribly different in gaming. Indeed if you want to start the analogy in the realm of art and literature, your likely to find lots of people who judge things bad, derrogatory or down for simply those reasons, Don't Play the piece, Feel the peice. <br/><br/>So people rather than saying, there are no objective standards, tell me about your objective standards. (if you want you can qualify a whole lot with post modernism, but im not terribly impressed with that either. ). <br/><br/>As to the fun people (ie if its fun for you) wouldn't you agree that active, active, and creative play is genreally funner.

You're not sharing your creation with other audience members, either, and communication is an essential part of a role-playing game experience.\n<blockquote>All media experience is at least partially mediated by the creative input of the participant; it's just a question of degree, really.

I hate hate hate being forced to be actively creative.  I don't want to be forced by the rules of the game to set up the scenes and make up the  NPCs or make up the mysteries I'm supposed to solve.  Games that force that on me are actively un-fun. They are stressful and I get too caught up in having to do the rest of that crap to be able to have the fun I want - which is to be my character, react to the world, the NPCs, the situations, solve the mysteries, overcome the obstacles, etc. Maybe fall in love with another PC or NPC.  Have rivalries and camaraderie among the party.  Use the situation and the world as a vehicle to drive my character around in.  I like engaging the GM and helping their story move along.  I like overcoming the challenges they set for me, and being surprised by them and surprising them in turn.  That's my fun.<br/><br/>Sure I like being able to suggest where to go next, or frame a scene or two when the mood strikes me.  And I'm not super keen on having to ask if there's a stick I can find in the forest.  But force 'active creativity' on me and I will be a cranky bear.<br/><br/>-C-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186913/#Comment_186913" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T15:01:40+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  3:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            stryck, thanks for chiming in!<br/><br/>What do you think of the various labels we've tossed out?

But here I mean being outside the game and watching.)  <br/><br/>And on occasion I have observed specific people who seem to be doing NOTHING.  Not initiating action.  Not even talking much.  But, post game, when I asked them what happened during the game, they run off this incredibly rich list of all things they observed, decisions they made, changes and emotions that occurred to their character.<br/><br/>Were they being passive?  Honestly, do we have a metric for this discussion?  Really?<br/><br/>I know, though, that SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING FOR THAT PERSON.  They were engaged.  They were, in fact, <i>doing</i> something.  (Though, again, how to measure it or compare it, I have no idea.)<br/><br/>I know this sort of thing -- on a sliding scale!!! MIND YOU!!! from very "passive"* to often "animated"* -- happens all the time at table top RPGs.  The game is happening, the players are engaged, they are doing <i>something</i>.

For example, each of GNS deals with active and creative contributions to the fiction. Less so to the social contract or underlying texture of play, But if that priority is changed then what may appear from a fiction-centric perspective as uncreative and reactive may simply by the spare effort a player has to engage with a tangential area of their interest in the game. <br/><br/>I've been one of those players you're talking about. It's not how I like to play all the time, but it is very fun, and very much active and creative, just in a very different way. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187003/#Comment_187003" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T17:49:13+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  5:49PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2009 8:35PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right. I think I said that.  I used the word "engaged."  You used creative and active.  My point is that there's all sorts of creativity and activity going on inside the Player's head.  They are taking elements offered by the GM and Players and mixing it up and <i>doing</i> things.  They are also adding details to play.  It might seem smaller, than say, grabbing the narration wheel in a game of <i>Primetime Adventures</i>. But I have no idea how to assume what or what is not happening in their imaginations.  Nor do I presume to.<br/><br/>But I want to be clear about this: I'm not siding with Logos7, nor am I siding against him.  He set up a false conflict.  Nor am I in agreement with the crankier members on this thread (Hi, Filip!)  I'm speaking as me; not as some multi-headed member of a committee.  <br/><br/>My post was all about getting around a bit of nonsense.  I can't claim to know when someone is being "creative" or mentally "active." Nor am I in any position to declare if it's inferior or not if one player meets a GM almost toe-to-toe as opposed who is more reticent in play.<br/><br/>This thread was started, as far as I can tell, because someone was offended.  I'm not quite clear what was supposed to come out of it.<br/><br/>(Besides, I never get into argument with people who have android names.

I've played with enough players of the variety that adds nothing at all to the interaction; the truly <i>passive </i>players.

It's not about being "nice" -- it's about facing reality.  Who am I to tell them they're not having a good time.  I've had players tell me with of their games, with great enthusiasm, but as I listen, all I can think is, "The GM was just telling you a story.  How is this fun?"

They are tolerable in a game.<i>Passive</i>players are too much of a drag. They will leech off energy from the interaction, and make it harder to achieve anything.Well, in addition to our fellow human players, we also play with chairs and a table, or at least with couches and armchairs.

I would suggest that the annoyance caused by passive players is proportionate to the amount the game weakens the creative power of the GM.  Similarly, I remember once sitting in on a Dragonlance game and it being made VERY clear to me that I was not to set the game off at tangents or 'reinterpret' my character.  That game was all about the GM telling a story with the players only really providing tactical input and as such being proactive and creative was seen as anti-social.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_187094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187094/#Comment_187094" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T07:47:02+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  7:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2009 7:51AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>what gives us the right to think someone requires reforming because their play preferences differ to our own?</blockquote>Freedom of thought?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>This all seems a bit one-true-wayist to me to be honest.</blockquote>Max: there is some truth out there. Not everything is equally sound or true.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>it seems to me that you define passive as "people ruining my fun"</blockquote>This is my definition:<br/><i><b>Passive </b>equals non-initiating and unresponsive.</i><br/><br/>In a role-playing game this mode of behavior is not ideal (and hardly in any other social interaction). If there is enough interactive players in the group it will still be fun. A single passive player will not ruin our fun completely, but the fun is generally greater when all contribute with their imaginative powers.

I never analysed <i>why</i> and I can't say for sure right now, but I'll try.<br/><br/>First, of course, he isn't totally irresponsive. BTW A totally irresponsive player can't ruin your fun once you stop trying to make him react. But he reacts minimally.<br/><br/>I have three hypothesis at the moment. First hypothesis, he sets a minimum reaction/performance level to which we can compare ourselves and derive some social value therefrom. A kind of reversed North? Note: so it appears we have (some of us are) active players who value "activity" and pursue it.<br/><br/>Second hypothesis: often in his kind of search for minimum reaction, he surprises us. Sometimes none of us would have thought like about what he thought. Nice.<br/><br/>Third hypothesis (and I think it may be the best): when we make him react, we know we hit something.<br/><br/>[Logging off now for some time (I don't know how long exactly, min 15 hours, max 2,5 days).]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187116/#Comment_187116" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T08:56:45+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  8:56AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [I had to find an internet connection to post this...]<br/><br/>Ok, I think I found the main reason: he enjoys playing characters which the most active players (myself included) would find totally unfun to play, but find fun to have in the playworld.

Here I go. Passive / uncreative / reactive play can\u2019t be inferior attitudes in general, but they surely are for given games / systems / CA / standards / play groups. Some games expect really passive players (with an active GM who will tell <i>his</i> story/plot). Some games can only work with all active players (eg. rotating GM responsibility games if everybody must do that work).<br/><br/>Now back to the other end of the thread.<br/><br/>I\u2019d like to point the obvious: passive / active, listening/egoistical, uncreative/creative, \u2026 attitudes aren\u2019t absolute. They\u2019re continuuyyumums thingies. Absolutely passive is a rock. It won\u2019t ruin your game, expect if you stubbornly wait for it to answer. I don\u2019t know what an absolutely active player could be, but I guess you\u2019d probably have to lock him up solidly in the cupboard, preferably with tape on his mouth, and continue to play (try to ignore the banging). Most players, happily, fall somewhere in-between, depending on mood, game, weather, and how much cola is left. On each scale (activity, respect for players, setting, game, creativity, \u2026) there are probably optimums for a given game (at a given time, with a given objective). Everything that is under <i>or over</i> these optima is inferior. Now, depending on where on the scale you place passive, reactive, proactive, (and obviously we do not all place them in the same approximate places), you can draw conclusions for a given standard/purpose, but these conclusions can\u2019t be shared until you\u2019ve unambiguously defined what criterions you use to evaluate that a player is passive / reactive /active / \u2026 Like I said, I am stating the obvious.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>what gives us the right to think someone requires reforming because their play preferences differ to our own?</blockquote>Freedom of thought?<br/><br/>You\u2019re being ironical, right?

In my view passive men have a problem when "participating" in a role-playing game; they don't really participate; they watch. Sometimes this is not a big problem for the others, but passive players is never a boon to a group and a game (mind you: I draw a line between passive and reactive-players).<br/><br/>You are dead wrong in your claim that they have sufficient training in <i>playing </i>this attitude. There is miles between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span> a passive man, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being able to portrait</span> a passive character in a role-playing game. Role-playing is an interactive practice. To play passive or unresponsive characters in a constructive way, you have to make the characters of the other players <i>perceive </i>them as passive in the fiction, and create the minute openings for the other characters to interact with your character on this premise. It is one of the more demanding character-portraits to deliver, and nothing for the passive guy with little experience in active interaction.<br/><br/>If you don't participate in the interaction which produce the fiction, you will at best <i>be taken for a passive character</i>. Such a conclusion is not based on your play, but on your lack of engagement, and it gives very little to the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ajax Aldwyne</cite>I just say that you can\u2019t draw general conclusions</blockquote>Well, you <i>seem </i>(sorry to throw this back at you) to say a lot more, like; <i>there are passive players that have a nice time playing </i>(?) <i>rpg's ... hence there are no qualitative difference between participating players and passive ones. </i><br/><br/>If this is correct then I do not agree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne" title="Ajax_Aldwyne"><img alt="Ajax_Aldwyne" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2234027609_bbb4299fe9_m.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ajax_Aldwyne">Ajax_Aldwyne</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187697/#Comment_187697" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T06:42:13+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  6:42AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oh never mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187702/#Comment_187702" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T07:21:05+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  7:21AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can we sink this thread already?

It seems like a normal initial statement for a thread here.I've certainly not argued the statements given in any defense of you. The issue at hand is interesting enough in itself.<br/><br/>I consider that "most people having passive, reactive, uncreative play" is a bit over the top. That is: false. This not being a value-judgement is fine with me. It <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> of course be a value-judgement in regard to "most people", or in regard to this kind of play ...but then it may not be too. I trust people to be in earnest when saying they are not passing judgement. Let's take that at face-value then ;-)<br/><br/>For myself I consider passive play to actually be of lesser value, generally, than most other modes of play (reactive, interactive and active). That is: it will invariably give less to the game than any of these modes, and are more prone to disrupt it than they are.So I am certainly passing judgment on that kind of play-mode. I do not mean to pass judgment on passive humans though. I've been there myself and feel no need to judge them, or to romanticize their situation.<br/><br/>Bucking out of the thread now.
