If you haven't posted already, please consider doing so.)<br/><br/>I'm going to phrase this question to Dave directly, but if you have a similar experience or insight, feel free to post as well.<br/><br/>This sounds like a real kick-ass, classic horror RPG moment, the kind you wish for every CoC session ever. Awesome!<br/><br/>In my experience, the kind of situation you have set up here works beautifully for situations where the <i>players want to be scared</i>. They anticipate an encounter with the unknown and creepy, so In-Character they attempt to minimize their risk of doing so, while Out-Of-Character they're secretly hoping the GM will throw them a scary bone. You obviously picked up on this cue and gave it to them at a very opportune moment.<br/><br/>How did you build the level of creepy during the investigation? In some CoC-style investigation games, the fear of the unknown decreases as players learn more and more about the enemy - how did you instead manage to make them more and more frightened the more they learned? How come the players didn't identify the "old, blind man" as an enemy and attack him instead of run away?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134709/#Comment_134709" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T15:51:57+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  3:51PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, first a disclaimer. This is one of my favourite RPG moments, but it happened in *1990*, OK? So my memories of the games are rather fuzzy.<br/><br/>Yes moments like this are classic, and hitting them right is often more effective than anything the GM can describe in the hope that it will seem horrible. I think the key is that the simplicity of the moment plunges the players right into the situation, so that they can totally imagine being what their character is seeing, and how scary that would be. It's cinematic, but simple. Anything that you can convey with one simple mime, like a head slowly turning, is good, I think. Another thing that works well, but is hard to pull off, is when you can describe something with a few words in a way that makes the players fill in the picture with something that they find particularly horrible. The unsaid can be very powerful. I don't know that I have a good example right now.<br/><br/>I agree that the players have to want to be scared, or at least a bit creeped out. It's possible to take them a little further down that road than they intended to travel. But some willingness is essential!<br/><br/>I also encouraged my players to make very ordinary, if reasonably well-off characters, and not particularly investigators, let alone combat types. And I tried hard to make sure that they were not penalized for making "in character" choices that are tactically suboptimal. In those days, it was all done by semi-freeform GM fiat. Nowadays, the phrase "have a FATE point" springs to mind, though some of my players are too "anti-metagame" even for FATE. Sigh.<br/><br/>As for other factors...<br/><br/>It's difficult for me to describe the game to you without SPOILERS for the published product. SPOILERS!<br/><br/>OK, here we go. The game begins in a railway carriage with a blind man, and when it goes through a tunnel, one of their fellow passengers is stabbed to death. The blind man also appears to have been dead, for quite some time in fact. So right away, they know that something is wrong. <br/><br/>The rest of the scenario revolves around the players being pursued by the blind men, who are in effectively endless supply. So they are forced to try to discover what is going on, and why the original victim was killed, in order to save themselves. The tension can be cranked up pretty slowly, with blind men slowly becoming more noticeable in the PCs lives, mysterious break-ins at their houses while they are out, blind men following them around the streets, etc. The scenario as written strictly allows only one blind man at a time, which is a pity in retrospect - groups of increasing size would be fantastic, but a slight problem for the final explanation.<br/><br/>The players may turn to violence against the blind men, but it doesn't accomplish anything. They are already dead - damage inflicted just makes them more distressing, and if you destroy, a new one soon appears. When the stakes are getting really high, however, they may start casting spells through parched and creaking vocal chords, and at that point violence becomes a necessary stop-gap measure, but still not a solution.<br/><br/>Another key is that although the PCs will learn more as they investigate about the plot that the dead man stumbled upon, they will never learn more about the blind men beyond the fact that they are eyeless and dead, until they finally track them to their source, and see what is going on at the other end of a magical connection. That's also a very satisfying moment when the whole thing makes a strange kind of sense, with any luck. Quite Lovecraftian, a bit like the end of The Whisperer in Darkness, to flatter myself briefly.<br/><br/>Having said that, the scenario as published is rather railroady here and there, and contains much that I would do differently these days (hey, I was young and it was 1990...). In particular, the rather forced Earth Mother ending was devised by Lynn Willis to make sure that the sequel scenario actually got to take place, as they were paying me for both! Fair enough at the time, but if anyone would like some alternative suggestions for how to handle the rising of the Dulcarnon, whisper me your email address, or just ask in this thread.<br/><br/>Whew, enough already.

The PCs had gone on board a derelict space station that had been abandoned for 800 years. Setting the tone and getting the atmosphere was important - dark, lifeless, utterly silent, a giant tomb (it was 10km long). It was a ghost story of sorts, with the personality of a long dead opera singer inhabiting the station's (now insane) AI. (I was riffing on Memories if you know the reference). The AI/singer longing to both embrace and destroy her husband (who drove her to suicide out the airlock) starts using holograms to entice the characters to their deaths. On top of all that before the station was shut down it was the sight of a battle between mercenaries who used dog-like war robots and a Brother Battle assault team, and some of those war-bots are still functional and controlled by the AI.<br/><br/>So, playing up the environment and then controlling the timing of creepiness was important, as was allowing the players to freak themselves out. After they boarded the station, we spent about an hour's play where nothing happened, and they were exploring around, but I made sure to point out and describe odd things here and there - a scattering of robot parts, a rotting dress draped over a chair, etc. They proceeded deeper into the station cautiously, but the lights they had were the only source and so I kept on mentioning how black it was.<br/><br/>When I turned on the weirdness, I built it up. First they saw figures moving in a lit room down the corridor. As they neared, the light went off. When they got there, the room was totally empty, no furniture, no people, no nothing (it was a hologram). A little later, they come upon the dead shell of a war-bot. Approach carefully, inspect, move on. Turn around again, it's gone.<br/><br/>When it was time to crank it up to 11, while they were resting, one PC starts hearing opera on his helmet radio. He goes to the door of the room and looks into the corridor. He sees the opera singer at the end of the hall. She's beckoning to him and he goes to her, the dark hull of the ship becoming an open field under blue sky (all a hologram). He goes to the singer who's standing in a gazebo. The other characters start hearing the opera too and wake up. They look around and see their buddy has walked down the hall and gone into the airlock. They can hear the music on their radios, which has gotten louder, but their comrade is in full rapture in the airlock (with the AI now creating it's holograms on his helmet face-shield (no one knew anything about the AI at that point). Everyone else is trying to get the airlock open, going at it with their cutting torch, pulling o the safety lever, as the airlock hatch release horn starts blaring...<br/><br/>Afterwards, the players said the whole thing creeped them out. The guy whose character went in the airlock said he rolled with it because it was cool and was freaking everyone out. Plus I had some opera aria going in the CD player in the background and that helped. It was a combination of pacing, descriptions, and the players actively trying to freak themselves out (rather just expecting me to scare them) that gave us the groove we needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135194/#Comment_135194" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T09:03:52+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  9:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike, thanks for adding your story!<br/><br/>One common denominator between Mike's story and Dave's seems to be that - in Forge speak - there are no real "bangs" in the buildup. Well, duh - that's because it's a <b>buildup</b>, but how do you hold a player's attention during this time? And how long <b>is</b> "this time"?<br/><br/>I re-read an old published adventure for Kult yesterday (Fallna \xc4nglar = Fallen Angels). In the last, and supposedly most climactic, of the three mini-adventures in the book, the players are meant to basically watch a timeline unfold for what I would suspect would be <i>minimum</i> 4-5 hours of real-time, before the GM gives them a little "cut scene" which they cannot affect and they finally get to make a choice. The choice they make determines which of three or four epilogues the GM reads.<br/><br/>Scary? Holy crap yeah! But how do you manage to keep the players interested for the 90% of the session where none of their actions really, truly matter much?<br/><br/>The obvious answer is "be an entertaining GM - tell a really suspenseful and riveting story". That's not really participatory, though, which is an element of the game I have recently come to expect.<br/><br/>Extra points to someone who can give suggestions on how to compensate for the problem using some sort of mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135228/#Comment_135228" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T12:31:08+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 12:31PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2008 12:31PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mikael... do you like scary movies? Most run for all of 90 minutes. The build-up portion, before the first really horrific thing happens, is often near zero - I recall one of the Scream movies or something in which Drew Barymore is killed off in the first scene (and thinking that was a great idea, as you expect star-power actors to last the entire movie). OK, sure, for the main characters, this is actually part of the build-up. <br/>\n<br/>\nFriday the 13th? Very fast. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt most, again, the build-up is going to last all of 80 of the 90 minutes. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, sure, you can draw things out longer, certainly. And if we assume that the pace of RPG play is slower than movies, we can assume that, perhaps, a couple of hours may pass. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wouldn't do any more than that. I'm not a great horror GM, I don't think... I just don't have scary timing. But the scenarios that I have run to best effect have all gotten past the build-up in less than two hours. Many in as little as half an hour. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause... to me the answer to your question is that you simply can't keep player attention that long before they get to really contribute to play. "Be entertaining" isn't going to cut it for as non-thrilling a GM as I. So my suggestions are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Cut to the good stuff quick. Yeah, a build-up is neccessary. But it can be astonishingly short.<br/>\n2. Use the build-up to reveal the characters' humanity. The point, in fact, of having any build-up is not what people assume. That is, the tension does not build because of a slow revelation of the nature of the horror. It builds because the impending horror is occuring to characters with whom we are feeling more and empathy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you *can*, in fact have bangs early on. They're just more subtle ones to do with establishing the values of the character. Who are they? What do they care about? <br/>\n<br/>\nInSpectres, despite being a spoof of the genre, does this automatically. That is, the early phases of a mission are all about getting us to feel for the normality of the characters. Then, later, when they face the horrific thing, there's a juxtaposition, and we laugh due to the fact that the normality stuff takes prescedence over the horror. But it only works at all because we know what the characters are going through, and feel for them. Like, "Oh, man, I've had days like that."<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's more, if you're tricky, you can use the values and such portrayed by this sort of bangs early, to set up the later, horrific bangs. Does character X sleep with character Y? Then we know darn well that Y is going to be found hanging by their intestines later... not yet dead... and the bad-guy is coming (asking the question, do I really care about this person, enough to risk my life to save them, or was that earlier decision just about a cheap thrill)? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, short version, give them mundane-ish bangs up front. Get through this fast. Then use the outcome of those choices to create horrific bangs later. Makes everything so much the better, and gives players something to do during the "build-up." <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135263/#Comment_135263" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T16:05:34+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  4:05PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mikael,<br/><br/>Do you carry anything away from the game?

You mean, apart from other role-playing experiences, horror or not?<br/><br/>Well, (modern) horror is a favourite fiction genre of mine, so a well executed session of a horror game tend to leave stronger memories than, say, an equally well executed action of an action or space opera game.<br/><br/>I suppose, if that's the answer you're fishing for, that a good game of personal horror would be more likely to provide feelings of catharsis or psychological healing than, say, a pulp game... but I wouldn't know anything about that.
