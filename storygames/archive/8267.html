This is a *fabulous* space, huge and open, with about 1/3 devoted to a very extensive game store (with a very well stocked IPR shelf!). The other two-thirds is an open gaming area with tables for the table top gamers, computers for the video gamers, and a giant videoscreen.  Here's a quick snap I took from in the open gaming area, facing toward the store:<br/><br/><a href="http://twitter.com/rafial/status/1042826620" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com/rafial/status/1042826620</a><br/><br/>Okay, enough fawning about that.  On to the event.  I had signed up to play in a run of the Sword, GM'd by David, who is Maedhros on the Go Play PDX forums:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.goplaypdx.com/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.goplaypdx.com/forum/</a><br/><br/>The players were myself, Joel, Jesse, and Zach.<br/><br/>So yeah, that's right, I got to PLAY Burning Wheel.  Not run, PLAY.  Well okay, I also acted as a second rules facilitator (more on this later) along with David.  But still it was PLAY.<br/><br/>I asked to play the Roden, so that I could lurk on the fringes when I needed to rules facilitate, and also so I could be all creepy and obsequious.  Jesse was the dwarf, Joel the elf, and Zach the criminal.<br/><br/>David gave a rundown of the system for the three players who had not had any formal exposure to BW, and I tried to pitch in where needed.  Then he set the scene for us, the doors to the ruined temple swung open, and it was ON.<br/><br/>The dwarf ran forward and failed a Greed test, and chose to stand in awe of the exquisite craftsmanship that was the eponymous sword.  The elf came up behind him, and began to berate him for his crass materialism.  While they traded insults, both the Roden and the criminal casually sauntered toward the plinth.  Sadly (for me) the criminal got there first and picked up the sword.<br/><br/>This got the dwarf's attention: "Hand it over".  The criminal ran for the door, but with a helpful distraction from the elf, the Roden sped in front of the criminal and slammed the doors closed in his face.  "No one leaves until I get paid".<br/><br/>The elf, seeking to create confusion, began to sing (the Song of Merriment, I believe).  All of the rest of us failed our Steel tests and fell into wonderment.  The dwarf and human by 5, and the rat (that's me!) by 2.  Shaking it off first, the Roden flattered the elf's beautiful song, and suggested that if only he were paid, he'd support the elf's claim to the sword.<br/><br/>This then led to same table discussion about resources, and how paying the rat would actually work.  The dwarf, human, and criminal tried to come up with some source of extra cash, and so some flash back scenes of finding miscellaneous treasure on the way down were attempted.  Scavenging rolls, trained and untrained failed to produce any joy.  No cash dice were to be had.<br/><br/>Aside: there was much discussion and book research over the applicability of wises to the treasure finding problem.  The elf was trying to get some mileage out of his Elven Artifact-wise.  In the end, an Ob5 obstacle made the question moot.<br/><br/>Finally the dwarf, elf, and human agreed to pool their cash to get the rat to shut up, and the human even kicked in his Persona point and made the roll.  4 dice for Ob2 is... ZERO successes.<br/><br/>With a scream of rage, the rat vanished into the dark shadows at the edge of the room.  "He's no longer blocking the door?" The human made a break for it, and was promptly tackled by the dwarf, who ripped the sword from his puny fingers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182045/#Comment_182045" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T01:23:30+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  1:23AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the dwarf admired the heirloom of his clan, the elf stepped forward and asserted his superior claim.  But the dwarf would have none of it.  "If words will not sway you, I shall try steel", and the furious elf lets fly a sword blow.<br/><br/>At this point, we had to make a decision.  David was hesitant about going forward with Fight! but both Jesse and Joel were interested in exploring the mechanic and Bill was game.  And well me, I can't get enough of it.  I recommended we limit maneuvers to Strike, Block, Avoid, and Lock, plus positioning.  This turned out to work well.<br/><br/>So elf vs dwarf.  David helped Jesse script, while I helped Joel.  I briefly explained the options and how things interacted, but let Joel make the final choices.  Then we set to.  The first two volleys were indecisive, with no blows landed, but then in the closing moments of volley 3, the dreaded double strike!  Both players hit, and so now only armor could save them.  The dwarf on the receiving end of the elf's run-of-the-mill sword, made his roll, and the blow skittered off.  Now it was the elf's turn.  David, as GM, decided that the SWORD had a VA of 1 (made by the elves, you know).  And that was just the margin it needed to for the blow to punch through the elf's armor and find purchase in flesh.  With a light wound, the elf ran screaming into the darkness as the Roden slammed the temple doors in his wake.<br/><br/>"Well my friend" opined the rat to the criminal, "you are shifty and dishonest, and I understand that.  These others I do not understand.  Let us kill this dwarf, you and I, and take the sword for ourselves.  With the proceeds from selling it, we'll both get what we want."  "Agreed" said the criminal, and with that they turned as one upon the hapless dwarf.<br/><br/>But not SO hapless.  "Hold" said the dwarf.  "The two of you might kill me, but one of you will surely die".  And the player said "can I persuade you guys not to kill me?"  And I said "Duel of Wits!"<br/><br/>So we did.  The criminal took the lead, with menacing help from the Roden, while the dwarf stood alone.  Points were made and rebutted, but then a failed Obfuscate left the dwarf open, and criminal and rat hammered it home.  But we'd lost just over half our disposition.  Major compromise time.  Our intent was "give us the sword and live".  The offered and accepted compromise was "we will hold the sword but not sell it if you can pay us what we are owed (plus a convenience fee) in a reasonable amount of time".<br/><br/>And the poor elf, who had been listening at the door, realized all was lost.  He burst in the door and began to sing the song of enmity.  "Do not listen to him, he will put a spell on us!" And with that, the other three turned upon the elf and cut him down.  We did a second Fight! for that, in which the elf faired well for a while, keeping the dwarf and Roden at range, while taking advantage of his longer weapon vs the human.  But as luck should have it, his earlier wound slowed him just enough to allow one of the human's knives to find purchase in the elf's neck, and another failed steel test saw him beg for mercy (in a noble elfy sort of way, I'm sure).  The dwarf ignored him, and stalked out of the temple, and the criminal slew the elf without thought or remorse.<br/><br/>And so it was.<br/><br/>Rules explanations, 2 Fights! and a Duel of Wits in 4 hours.  A thing of beauty.  It was great having two rules facilitators, since David and I were able to catch each others mistakes, or cite a rule the other couldn't remember.  The buck stopped with David vis-a-vis rules interpretations and obstacle setting.  We also took the time to go through post game Artha awards, so that folks could start to grasp how the reward cycle works for extended play.<br/><br/>I had a great time, and Jesse said that he had not expected to like BW, but now he wanted to play more.  Joel was also impressed.  We spent some time discussing what sets BW apart from other games.  For me it is the assumption that the players will want to, and in fact enjoy mastering and employing the rules.  David talked about the traction that the rules give you to put your beliefs into action in the fiction.<br/><br/>And then he showed us lots of cool maps from his campaign world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182104/#Comment_182104" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T09:47:31+00:00" title="December  8, 2008  9:47AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Wheel!  It Burns!<br/><br/>Many, many thanks to Rafial for his assistance with facilitating.  I was a bit nervous beforehand (because of some difficulties I had been having playing BW with my regular group - but that's another story) and it was extremely helpful to have another educated voice-of-reason to adjudicate the rules.  <br/><br/>I was indeed reticent to wade into Fight!, since it would have been my first time, but Rafial was right - it flows smoothly once you're in.  [CAVEAT:  as with many indie games, forum discussion clarifies many rules.  Having both spent some time on the BW forums, Rafial and I were able to grok one another.]<br/><br/>Oddly - or maybe not, given the quality of the players - my one-shot of The Sword went much more smoothly and was much more fun than my ongoing game in it's sixth session.

Jesse, my current gaming schedule is getting overloaded but I purchased Mouse Guard in spite of some of my misgivings about Burning Wheel (doesn't seem to prevent me from buying everything Luke &amp; Co put out though - such pretty products...), because I've loved the comic since its inception and liked what I'd read/heard about Luke's approach for the Mouse Guard RPG.  I can't play soon, but I'm on board if you start a Mouse Guard game sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182280/#Comment_182280" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T23:25:54+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 11:25PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2008 11:26PM by rafial.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, it was Zach, not Bill, but he doesn't read these forums, so no big deal.</blockquote>\nDoh!

"The Sword" has always sounded reeeeeally really limited to me. Like, "it's a dungeon crawl where you skip past the crawl, and just fight over the loot." Yeah, it's the kind of face-stabby situation I love in games, but cutting out context and build-up made it sound like it'd be over in nothing flat. Great for like a half-hour booth demo, maybe, but for "real" play?<br/><br/>However--in play it actually rocked! There was a bit of drag at first while I struggled to get "in gear" with the fictional situation. It was tough to just "play cold" these characters who supposedly have been through this whole adventure together and possibly have more history besides--family history at the very least. But all I needed was a basic sense of "just how did all these people manage to agree to do this venture together <i>at all</i>?" (our answer: the Dwarf was probably mum about wanting the sword, just coming along as an "appraiser") and I was good to go--berating, debating, bedazzling, and, um, stabzzling with abandon.<br/><br/>And we filled up the timeslot, too! Not in the sense that it dragged on and on, but in that we had engaged, passionate play which, along with fully enjoyable rules-learning, filled up 4-ish hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183259/#Comment_183259" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-13T19:24:58+00:00" title="December 13, 2008  7:24PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some notes on the game:<br/><br/>*Fidhean's song was in fact, "The Ballad of Eldil the Forger," i.e. the account of his own father making the sword. It was meant to <i>both</i> arrest everyone's attention and halt the fleeing thief, and also push forward my claim to the sword. Unfortunately I wasn't able to press this advantage, as the thief resisted (Wonderment and all!) my command to surrender the sword.<br/><br/>*The payment issue was indeed a tricky beast. I like the idea of Resource or Wealth mechanics where you just roll to see if you can afford something, rather than counting pennies. However, in this situation, with the situation keyed specifically to be precarious in terms of scraping together payment, we ended up with a sort of "Schrodinger's Coin Purse" scenario where we didn't know if we could afford it until we rolled, which is weird since we're all <i>offering</i> to pay in all sincerity, then find out we're broke. I found it awkward from a roleplaying situation, because I didn't want Fidhean to be a welcher or liar.<br/><br/>*I was also confused over the application of -wise skills. My default mindset is, if I've got, say, "Manwise," and I'm in conflict with a Man, that should garner me some advantage. But apparently Manwise is more about knowing specific facts about the subject? Which is super-powerful in its sphere: I can, as the player, <i>invent</i> factual information about Men, or Elven Artifacts, or anything else I have a -Wise in! But in this specific context, where I basically want to persuade or capture or kill a man, that wasn't the kind of advantage I was looking for. And when my entreaties to apply Manwise to "knows Men's hearts that I may persuade him" or "know how Men fight that I may stab him" were rebuffed, I had precious few advantages I could leverage.<br/><br/>*Fight! was awesome. And I say this as someone who lost big in every clash of blades. The challenge of second-guessing your opponent's strategy combined with the thrill of gamble on the actual strike was intuitive and robust. And the slick Maneuvering system was equally cool for giving us a nuanced and tactical picture of our battle's "space" without resorting to grids, miniatures and such. I love it! If I could've rolled a decent Strike I'd have been cooking with gas.<br/><br/>*Duel of Wits seemed pretty cool, though I was only a spectator. One interesting aspect of both the Fight! and DoW systems is the possibility of a "double whiff" when both parties' options line up in certain ways, like "Avoid vs. Avoid." In Fight! I'm pretty OK with it, 'cuz we're talking about lightning-fast maneuvering in the space of heartbeats, and another Volley comes up immediately. For DoW it seems weirder from a fictional standpoint to have, say, a Feint vs. Feint (or whatever example actually came up in the game), where the two actions are meaningless against each other, and just become color narration. Why would you attempt to Feint when there is nothing to Feint against? I guess there's some merit in the system simulating the messiness of conversation; non-sequiters, poor listening, people talking over each other, etc. But it looked a bit jarring from my perspective in a way that Fight! wasn't.<br/><br/>*Oh, and you left out the Concession the Dwarf earned in the debate: that they all kill Fidhean on the way out!<br/><br/>*The last fight was thrilling, even though I lost the gamble, because I could see a chance and seize it, even in a three-on-one battle. The game gave me <i>traction</i>, a concept I've explored <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/2008/09/23/the-game-in-a-jam/" rel="nofollow">in my blog</a>: robust options to strive for my goals, that are neither too sluggish or detailed, nor a glorified coin-flip. In this case I was able to use Maneuver to pick a target and Maintain with him, while Withdrawing from the other two, in effect circling about and keeping my opponent between me and the others. Which is pretty cool and elegant for a simple set of commands + dierolls! If I'd made a good Strike, I may well have felled the craven wretch, and then proceeded to the other two, hopefully aided by the Wonderment my song was about to trigger in an action or two. As it happened, alas! I tossed a whole mess of dice riddled with 1s, 2s and 3s. But it was great to have that chance to show my mettle.<br/><br/>*One thing that was weird to deal with: there were lots of skills, Instincts, and Traits that were utterly useless in the current scenario. Which makes perfect sense for BW as a whole: not everything is gonna be useful in every situation, and a lot of the stats were included for "completeness" of a character. And I wouldn't feel in the least gypped if I <i>was</i> playing a more extended campaign where a variety of situations are likely to arise. But in the present situation I found myself scraping for advantage, trying out every skill imaginable to see if the GM would rule it germane, like the aforementioned -Wises. I started to feel a bit weasely, though I took my rejected proposals in good grace. I guess maybe I'd have liked for Fidhean especially to have more tools that were applicable to the scenario.<br/><br/>*It was also pretty cool to play a very Tolkien-y Elf. I'd heard that BW was great for that, and sure enough, when I got Fidhean's sheet, the Elf Trait descriptions, plus the particular collection of Beliefs and Instincts told me everything I needed to know about the guy. My favorite bit was the very end where I'd surrendered (yes, Wilhelm, <i>very</i> gracefully!) and recieved a cut throat for my trouble. Fidhean's last moments were lying on the cold stone with lifeblood pouring from a cut throat, mouthing, "my exile is ended."<br/><br/>Very cool. Very fun. Thanks, David and Wilhelm. And thanks Luke!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183337/#Comment_183337" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T17:13:16+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  5:13PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, it's entirely possible I simply messed up when I disallowed your Man-wise FoRK.

The handouts with brief rules-text for all the character-sheet elements were great, but I wasn't able to assimilate ALL of it.<br/><br/>And anyway, no harm, no foul. Or, rather, there WAS harm, but no hard feelings.

Creativity in application is encouraged, but you also want to avoid the remorseless slide into "everything-wise".  I think one thing that should be kept in mind is a firm requirement to narrate their application, and narrate it as it relates to the task and intent at hand.  So it is one thing to say "I know how men fight", and another to cite specific detail of how men fight, and how you are able to take advantage of that (and this shades into the fact generating function of wises).<br/><br/>Brawling is almost a default fork for combat skills, but if you keep to the "current and specific" guidelines of narration for qualifying for the fork die, then the brawler is the guy who is tossing dirt in the other guy's eye, kicking at his knees, biting, etc.  And that color distinguishes him from the "clean" duelist for example, who may be forking his knives into his sword, for the off hand parry or trapping the other guys blade.<br/><br/>So I think what I'm trying to say is that the price of leveraging your skills (and especially wises) for extra dice is a requirement on the player to generate specific color to go along with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183597/#Comment_183597" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T23:12:51+00:00" title="December 15, 2008 11:12PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafial</cite>I think one thing that should be kept in mind is a firm requirement to narrate their application</blockquote>\nThis right here, makes a LOT of sense, an it is something i had a blind spot to regarding -Wises. I'd guess it's a bad habit gleaned from D&amp;D Knowledge skills.<br/><br/>It seems like that principle (narrate the use, don't just state the use) is what often makes the difference between a Trait mechanic that sings vs. one that falls flat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>That said, it did kinda seem like Brawl was a cheap FOrK for Combat, being infinitely applicable, while the rest of us lacked a lot of resources in that arena.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
