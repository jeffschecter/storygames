If you want to drum up some interest for your game before the day, let me know and I'll put it on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, James Mullen has been busy.  He's talked the owners of the Veranda Talk indian restaurant, directly over the road from the Old Bath House, into giving us an offer on a lunch buffet.  Concrete Cow attendees will be able to eat there for \xa35.00 a head, instead of the usual \xa36.95.  However, they need to know that they'll be getting at least 10 people to make it worth their while.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to have the indian buffet lunch, please let us know ASAP that you'll be coming so that we can let the restaurant know.  We need to make sure we have enough people going to offer the deal.  Either PM me or just reply here if you'll be coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Veranda Talk is very nice, with really good food.  I had lunch there last time and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The Guests of Honour have confirmed they're coming, as have the traders.  Unfortunately, Robin Elliott of Triple Ace Games won't be able to make it.

It's a shame, and both he and I are sorry for any disappointment this may cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat just means Rich Stokes will have to work that much the harder to fulfil a double-dose of Guest of Honour duties!
