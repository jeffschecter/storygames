The first session or two used HeroQuest. Then we switched to a home-made system based on L\xe6relyst. <br/><br/>The campaign started a bit slow; the fiction didn't have any real weight yet, we didn't know the characters or the setting. Spent some time building it up. <br/><br/>Then we had a stretch of really fun, heroic sessions. The characters levelled up a lot, finished a lot of quests, had sex with gods, killed hundreds of enemies, etc.<br/><br/>Then the hammer fell - everything went bad. The enemy empire burned down their clan village. Their clan blamed the characters, and even tried to kill some of them. One of the characters fell for the lures of a trickster god, and there was internal strife as she tried to trick the other characters. The party left their clan behind and went off into the wilderness, with a vague plan of revenge against the Lunar empire.<br/><br/>At a session two months ago, we had The Talk. I broke off after an hour or two of play, saying I had trouble believing in the characters anymore. We didn't fight, but we did end up putting blame on each other and having a bad, negative focus.<br/><br/>Last session, I found out we needed something to bring everyone together again. We were all on different tracks, and talking just didn't help. So I decided we try a session of Archipelago, still with the same characters and all.<br/><br/>The effect was really positive. Right from the start, when we were making destiny points for each other (I controlled some NPCs), we were all laughing at the bold and silly ideas we threw at each other. We practiced the phrases, just quickly, and rolled a die to see who would set the first scene. Then we drew a map, because we'd forgotten to do so; there was a bit of "do it differently" used already at that point, when one player drew Donald Duck on the map and another made a giant penis tower (which, after some discussion, we accepted anyway, because who knows what different cultures do, right?)<br/><br/>Scene-setting can get so bold in Archipelago. Somewhere mid-session, one players started out his scene (playing Harran) saying: "Harran dies." One player, who had earlier wanted a lighter tone in the campaign (I think), set a scene where the entire village was under the spell of the trickster god - doing insane things, dying of hunger, etc. One of my destiny points brought a major, beloved NPC back from the dead. When players get power, they do cool things with it.<br/><br/>After the game, I think we all felt that this was working again. We're moving towards the end of the campaign now, in 1-3 sessions; not because we want to kill it off, but because it feels like it's run its course and it's time to move on, I think.<br/><br/>So maybe this was a case of the group touching base, <b>showing - not telling </b>- what we wanted the game to be. Talk can only do so much.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301678/#Comment_301678" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-21T19:23:04+00:00" title="November 21, 2010  7:23PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good story, Matthijs.

You have these familiar characters, but a whole new set of toys to play with, and I think there is a sense of freedom in taking the character in new directions. Sometimes a player getting attached to a character means they try to keep them within this safe little bubble, and mixing it up by switching systems can get them to extend into new directions they hadn't considered before.<br/><br/>Good story, and sounds like a fun game.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
