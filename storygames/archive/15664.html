James is a fellow gamer, but this is one of the rare chances we play with some other friends who aren't nerds like us. Fun! This group has already played the Small Southern Town and Manna Hotel playsets, so I wanted to provide some bold new options.<br/><br/>I hadn't actually been to the <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow">official Playset of the Month page</a> in a while. Wow! So many crazy, awesome, free things!<br/><br/>I settled on Reconstruction, Transatlantic and Quest for the Golden Panda. But it was not easy.<br/><br/>The game's not until tomorrow, though, if anyone has a favorite they want to make a case for.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355103/#Comment_355103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T10:09:57+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 10:09AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you think the players might be in the mood to make with their best 'orrible French, Brit &amp; German accents, I can recommend Lucky Strike as a set that produced a great session recently.<br/><br/>Golden Panda and Reconstruction have been at the top of my "must play" Fiasco sets for some time now.

On board, Pierre Lecarre was posing as wealthy American peanut farmer Percibald Jackson, but he was (sort of) found out when his brother-in-law, Hank Shanksmith, an uneducated harpooner, was rescued from the Georgia Peach, which sank in the North Atlantic with all hands aboard. Shanksmith spent a night of strong, manly passion with Reginald Black, who denied this forbidden love until the end of the game, when, gut-shot by Burt Smythe, he begged Shanksmith's forgiveness. There was also a pirate ship of Australians, and a bag full of tiaras, and the cruise ship may not have actually sunk, but it was hard to tell.<br/><br/>TLDR: A fiasco happened on a boat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355295/#Comment_355295" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T22:02:39+00:00" title="January 21, 2012 10:02PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you hear in your head when you think of metal?
