There was not a regular game of Steam, Steel and Murder last week so I put the Technoir playtest into our feed.  Part 1 is up now and I'll get part 2 up in a few days.  Remember that this was not the current incarnation of the rules and happened while the Technoir Kickstarter was still going on.  We do character generation and fumble our way through a four hour session.<br/>\nHere is the feed for Steam, Steel and Murder :  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SteamSteelMurder" rel="nofollow">Of Steam, Steel and Murder</a><br/>\n<br/>\nand here are the links to the individual files if you don't want another RSS feed polluting your podcatcher.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://blumagik.com/steamsteelmurder/audio/Technoir07-01-11A.mp3" rel="nofollow">Here is part 1</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://blumagik.com/steamsteelmurder/audio/Technoir07-01-11B.mp3" rel="nofollow">Here is part 2</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
