                    So D&amp;D and other traditional RPGs developed out of wargames.  Most of the mechanics were about combat and other conflict.  However, in the last decade we've seen an explosion of boardgames which center on building and trading -- like Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, and so forth.  <br/><br/>So what RPGs have the most interesting building and trading mechanics?  What games have this as a focus of play?  There are some early games, like Champions and Ars Magica, which have interesting build mechanics that occupy some focus.  But are there games which make this more the focus of play?  Are there structural reasons why RPGs <i>shouldn't</i> focus on building and trading?                </div>

                            Joshua, GURPS actual play often focuses on building, but how do the rules support it?<br/>
<br/>
And Agora structures building as a conflict, but how does it handle trading?                        </div>

                            Having played two campaigns of GURPS Riverworld, I can tell you that this is something that GURPS actually does support pretty well.  Actual play basically boils down to finding the materials and the skills to put things together and then protecting your infrastructure.  So McGuffin (materials), McGuffin (people with the skills or who can teach the skills), and Big Bad (raiders who want your infrastrucutre).  No problem.<br/><br/>Agora's trading comes out in the banking and support rules.  At the end of a conflict, you get Resource dice.  You can either bank those and grow them with interest or you can hand them over to other players.  You can hand them over as payment for their help, as bribes for their later help, as taxes, whatever.  Now, Resources aren't really that differentiated outside of die size, so there's no my-lumber-for-your-wool sorts of trades, but there is an interplayer economy to be used and exploited.                        </div>

                            Traveller was reasonably playable as an economic game. Though it did break down once you figured out a good route that generated lots of proffit. Some of the old MIT folks had some pretty good Traveller games going which included trade as a significant factor (but they were really only Traveller in name, they really didn't use the published rules). Actually, apparently one of the campaigns has still been running recently, <a href="http://www.3rd-imperium.com/Gaming/RPGs/PlayerCharacters/RPG_Player_Characters.html" rel="nofollow">here's a page</a> with a link to 100 pages of campaign logs from Paul Gazis's game...<br/><br/>For economic board games, I've always enjoyed 1829 (etc.) and Acquire. With their stock market simulation, they might make a good basis for an economic game.<br/><br/>I'd love to see some decent trading rules that allow enough proffit opportunity to make them worthwhile, while not being "free money" rules.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            it's one thing to provide rules for statting things up in a ruleset.  That doesn't count as "building" rules in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Building rules would be something that would tell you what you need to have, ICly, in order to build something, and would cover how to get those things.                        </div>

The more complex and, well, INTERESTING this kind of game gets... the better off you are with computer moderation.  You might be better off adding in character communications to PvP SMAC than you would be trying to make something like Agora more like SMAC.                        </div>

                            What I would want for an RPG is a good economic system to use as a backdrop. I wouldn't want the game to be ABOUT the trade (or building), but to use that trade as the backdrop in front of which the fun stuff happens. But for this to work well, the backdrop and foreground need to interract.<br/><br/>And I agree: <i>Then again a real "economy" (which is what we're talking about) is notoriously difficult to build in such a way that it "runs".</i><br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

There is no need for the building rules to be in-character (assuming that's what you meant by "<i>ICly</i>"); and more than that conflict rules have to be in-character actions (disproved by games like <i>Polaris</i> and others).  <br/><br/>For example, Champions has out-of-character creation, followed by in-character "action" phases and out-of-character "build" phases where you spend the points which you earned.  However, there is only one currency and it has no trading (except perhaps that you can donate points to a group vehicle or base).  Still, building Champions stuff can be quite fun.  <br/><br/>Ars Magica is indeed a better case.  There are several currencies: the different types of pawns of Vis, plus books and a few other items.  There is a clear turn structure of seasons.  You can trade with other PCs for what you need, and have interactions over that.  However, it can be a bit overcomplicated -- apparently even moreso in the later editions compare to the second edition which I played.  <br/><br/>As for computer moderation, I say feh.  <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2651" rel="nofollow"><b>Power Grid</b></a> doesn't need a computer, nor do many other great trading and building board games.  Computer moderation inhibits good build and trading design, because it means that the players don't get to understand how the building really works.                        </div>

                            Well, are we talking about an economy that <em>constrains</em> or an economy that <em>provokes</em>? <br/><br/>It sounds to me, Vax, like you're asking after stuff that tells you "You can't do X until you have Y and Z."  And that channels play into acquiring Y and Z so that you can get X.  That's a worthwhile and useful function of economies in games, especially computer games.  However, that's not the only utility that an fictional economy can provide.<br/><br/>A game economy can also provoke players to action.  Agora works off of this emphasis; the rule set doesn't give a shit what you're building or what you need.  You provide that by framing your scenes and creating Obstacles.  You can be gengineering super soldiers or plowing a field.  The important thing is that you are trying to accomplish something and you are expressing your ideals and expending resources in order to do it.                        </div>

<em>JBR, so how do the GURPS rules handle, for example, gathering resources, whether materiel or labor?

                            Wait, so Joshua (BR), does that McGuffin action have anything to do with the GURPS rules?  i.e.  Couldn't I have done the same thing using Burning Wheel or any other rules set?  Or was there anything distinctive to GURPS about it?  <br/>
<br/>
To the general question -- I don't see how build mechanics are different than combat or social influence mechanics as far as driving the game.  You can have a game which is about clans of fixed numbers warring with each other.  But you can also have a game about groups which compete with each other in their expansion.  In story terms, they seem appropriate for stories where the protagonist goes through a great rise in station.                        </div>

                            On the macro scale this sounds like, the candidate that jumped to my mind was D&amp;D's <i>Birthright</i> (and the updated knock off for 3rd ed, <i>Empires</i>).  Traditional D&amp;D-style play was just the occaisional moment of focus between longer periods of playing a gameof princes, priests, high wizards and merchant princes fighting over (or sharing amiably, depending on the game) the resources available.  The trade component was highly abstract, as were many of the other elements, but as a whole it provided an excellent building game framework into which youcould insert adventures (and, I add, by doing so allowed the adventures to have exceptionally potent contexts).<br/><br/>Still, I suppose it doesn't have the <i>most</i> focus on building - war and adventure are also important, it was still a critical piece, and could be central if that was the real goal.<br/><br/>On a more personal scale,  in the Traveller vein both Run out the Guns and 50 Fathoms (for Savage Worlds) do and excellent job of offering a backend trading-game engine, albeit one not much more complex than "Here are a list of ports, and what things by and sell for at them - move goods around and PROFIT!"<br/><br/>There is also the probably mythical tale of the game of turn of the century intrigue using a game of Diplomacy as its front end, but that is only legend.<br/><br/>If we are, however, talking something with the kind of underlying clean simplicity and power of a eurogame, I have yet to see such a beast.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            John (jhkim), I don't think you really understand my point.<br/>
<br/>
Ars Magica does, indeed, have some small measure of "building" rules... you need so many pawns of vis in order to accomplish permanent magical effects that you want.  Trading (outside of PC to PC interactions) is relegated nearly entirely to GM fiat, however, which to my mind means that it's not part of Ars Magica, but simply part of certain particular implementations of Ars Magica.<br/>
<br/>
The economic life of the covenant, aside from vis, falls entirely in the purview of GM fiat.<br/>
<br/>
To me, this makes Ars Magica's building and trading component weak, in my opinion; certainly much weaker than Settlers of Catan's.<br/>
<br/>
You could say that Ars Magica makes the statement that the only thing that matters is magic, but I'd argue that point, given the importance that troupe play places on non-magical characters.  If only magic mattered then the only PC's would be the wizards.<br/>
<br/>
In Settlers of Catan, there are rules for acquiring the resources to build EVERYTHING that matters.  Admittedly, the game achieves this by narrowly defining what matters; a roleplaying game must be more flexible and so cannot be as complete, but if we're going to talk about a game that has a strong economic system, then there must be rules for acquiring the resources to build things that matter.<br/>
<br/>
Agora achieves this by leaving both the resources needed and the things that are built to be defined by the players.  It's not the most satisfying implementation in my opinion, but it's a very good start.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that's currently happening in Mike Holmes' thursday night IRC Heroquest game is that my character, Okhfels, wants to build a bridge linking a mystical island on a lake with the shore.    How long will it take to build?  How much stone does he need?  How many people does he need?  How much help will magic give?  I have no idea.  The whole question has to fall on GM fiat because the game gives no support to the question.  Is that a bad thing?  No, because Heroquest really isn't ABOUT that kind of activity... but for any game that DOES want to be about building and trading, there needs to be SOME way to answer those kinds of questions.                        </div>

What I'm looking for instead is a game which <i>uses</i> trading and building mechanics as part of its goals.  <br/><br/>Consider as a parallel conflict games (like Chess) compared to RPGs like Dogs in the Vineyard or Rune which make use of conflict mechanics.  I want an RPG which uses trading and building as effectively as Dogs uses conflict.  Ars Magica isn't it, but I think it's worth noting how well it does work.  Note that Dogs doesn't strictly define the opposition in the conflicts which PCs face, either.  In Dogs, the GM can always beat the PCs by throwing sufficient numbers at them.  By contrast, Rune is a more strict conflict game where the GM can't just beat the PCs.  <br/><br/>So getting back to trading and building -- I don't think that precisely defined supply is necessary for trading and building to be interesting.  Within Ars Magica, yes, trading with the GM in some NPC encounter isn't interesting.  But with the PCs forming a covenant which has limited resources, then trading among the PCs is interesting.  Each mage will have their projects, and they need to trade off resources.  <br/><br/>So, we could have a trading/building RPG parallel to Rune which is close to a boardgame.  However, I think it can also be interesting to have a trading/building RPG which is more a parallel to Dogs, using building mechanics but with looser constraints.  I'm still in the process of reading Agora -- I'll see what I think when I'm done.                        </div>
