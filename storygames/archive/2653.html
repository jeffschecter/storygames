As they were playing they commented that it would be a good game to play before playing a story game/ third generation game/ Forge game to get the players into the mindset of taking charge int he game. The show is a little over two hours long.<br/>\n<br/>\nPodcast of an actual play session at http://harpingmonkey.com/ click on the tab for podcasts. Then click on Rolemonkeys and select episode #11. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
