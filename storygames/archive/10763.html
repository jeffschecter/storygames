Similar creatures or maps or themes?  For creatures, I think you could do this pretty easily by just playing with a stacked deck of tiles -- say, sorting out all the tiles that have kobold encounters, and using only those*.  Doing the "level 2, then level 4" part is easy.  And I'm pretty sure this would be a fast way to generate the delves.<br><br>Ralph:  glad to hear you had fun; I did too.  You're pretty much on target for how the GM side worked.  We played pretty fast that slot -- I wanted to playtest as many of my new critters as I could.  You certain CAN stop and smell the roses if you want to.  In fact, the Event Cards (unfinished as of GPNW) are designed for just that -- though they can also be played as "Hey, make me a few skill checks and let's move on to the next encounter" if you want.  <br><br>Bryant:  Well, I'm hoping the game is useful for a wider demographic than the one that Ralph has mentioned (though I definitely want to appeal to that demographic).  There's a couple of ways I think that this can work: (1) use the Event Cards for more in-dungeon roleplaying and GM-interjected events for more pre-/post-dungeon roleplaying, or (2) strip off the game's "outer shell" that frames the encounters and frame the encounters yourself and simply use DCK to take a huge bite out of the work you have to do to prep encounters.  I'd love to get feedback on the rules from that perspective, and won't be at all put out if you take a look at the rules and decide it's not for you.  Though, of course, I'd want to hear why.  But you should probably be able to form an opinion by reading the rules (8 pages or so).  <br><br>*at least for the initial draw, which determines what encounter to use                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238828/#Comment_238828" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T23:40:54+00:00" title="October 22, 2009 11:40PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2009 11:41PM by Guy Srinivasan.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lee Short</cite>Guy:  in what way are you linking the encounters?

Glad to hear you are interested.  <br/><br/>You can certainly get stuff for a playtest if you PM me.  I've even got some printed prototype stuff (cards, books, etc) that I'd be happy to send you for the price of shipping.  <br/><br/>Right now, the game is in limbo, because I'm not sure how I can produce it for a marketable price.  The game really needs all the components in the base set: tiles, cards, and the books.  That's tough to do in a smaller print run while keeping the price reasonable.  I actively investigated a larger print run (1000+).  Some fairly in the know people thought the there just wasn't that kind of market for a third party 4E supplement --- but that DCK might find a market as a Pathfinder supplement.  Given that the original design was for 3.5, that has some appeal.  But I've had too much else on my plate to do that much rework (I've never even bought the Pathfinder books).  Another possibility is doing some sort of PDF or partial-PDF product.  <br/><br/>Just seeing this thread pop up prompted me to make a couple of (sadly, fruitless) phone calls and start thinking about it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337077/#Comment_337077" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T05:53:30+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  5:53AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2011 5:54AM by Valamir.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once you have an idea of how to get it where you want and just lack the funds to make it happen, try a Kickstarter.  <br/><br/>Surely by now there's a big enough network of interested people to help get the word out and generate some attention.  Especially if you come up with a cool actual play video showing it used effectively to set up encounters and short scenarios.<br/><br/>I know I'd contribute for a set.
