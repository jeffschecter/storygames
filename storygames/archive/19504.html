I will point out that the first supplement -- which has the terrible label of an "advanced" rulebook. Regardless, there's lots of nifty setting details and character options; don't let the advanced bit warn you off. I don't have Public Enemy, the 2nd supplement, just yet.<br/><br/>The rules are fun and do a good job with combining story-game mechanics with a bit (and just a bit) of crunchier system.

I guess if you really wanted a dice bonus(before a roll or after)?  It seems like it should be more tenuous a relationship then that?  Your player should have to do a bit of work to keep their Lois viable.  If your character's longevity is dependent on Loises, why waste one?  And SEVEN npcs per player character?  That's crazy!  Yes, I know seven is the maximum number of Loises per pc, but it's still crazy.  You end and start play with three(right?).

In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/425388#Comment_425388" rel="nofollow">the general J-RPG thread</a>, I shared a little AP from one of the two times I've run it, and yeah, I did not even try and bring in any of the non-Scenario Loises unless one of the players initiated contact, that's just way too many NPCs to juggle, especially in a one-shot game.<br/><br/>I also am pretty leery of trying to stat up my own NPCs, because the book doesn't really give any kind of baseline for stats or advice on builds, and the ones in the scenarios are all over the place (like, the climax of Tomorrow's Children I think it was, where you need to shoot down the missiles would have easily been a total fail if one PC didn't have an attack that flat-out ignored armor, and even as is he needed to burn some Tituses).  Forunately this game does have a fair number of scenarios, and I'm very interested in the Scenario System that apparently randomizes a lot of details to make them replayable, but I haven't picked up the False Hearts book it first shows up in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433896/#Comment_433896" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T09:13:54+00:00" title="June 16, 2014  9:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still reading it too, along with anything I've found out there about it. So far it looks like something that needs to be railroaded but only on the side of the pseudo sci-fy events, facts and how the exposition is made (in small parts, but simple enough so players will get the whole picture on three scenes at best).<br/><br/>The rest of it though, needs to be completely played unsafe: the way the relationships between characters, loises, tituses and fronts develops will definitely be handled by players interaction and perhaps some random rolls on the encounter table and the positive/negative emotion chart. In general, it looks like you would fare better by using as much material from the book as you can, specially all the provided NPCs to keep things going. <br/><br/>I'm thinking of picking a couple syndromes and powers at random and see what they do. Even if that doesn't make a functional character that's a good story by itself: It's not like all overeds get to choose what they turn into. The rest comes from thinking: what kind of issues would a person like that bring into the world? How could people react to him/her? How would that shape his/her future actions? So now you have a story that begins with a rumor about an unusual event that the UGN thinks may be related to an Overed. The false Hearts may be involved too, so now it's a race to find the person and the intentions behind.<br/><br/>Use the same trick (pick a syndrome or two and another couple powers with those and see what they do) and place it with an Overed who is already part of one of the groups. Roll a few times on the tables and see what comes up and what kind of chanbes that character could bring into the organization, and how good or bad that goes into the organization's agenda. Now you've got the story of a brilliant newcomer that turns the whole organization upside down either for good or bad. Figure out how the main players (NPCs) would react to this and go from there.<br/><br/>Looks like I could go on for hours, this book simply fills my mind with ideas, it's awesome ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433900/#Comment_433900" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T11:00:28+00:00" title="June 16, 2014 11:00AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2014 1:15PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's at the very least, an interesting read.  I think a bunch could be streamlined, and you wouldn't loose much of the flavor.  I'm cool with it as is, but I'm not sure I have the heart to keep track of every little detail anymore.  What I really mean is Encroachment, but I guess you needn't keep track of it too much.  You'd think there'd be a better way to track Encroachment then with pencil and eraser.  I mean cards would be so much better, in my opinion(or tokens for that matter).  <br/><br/>I do have a question; so somewhere I was reading that when player character enters a scene, they take 1D Encroachment.  The scene mechanics aren't exactly clear.  I mean.. they're fairly clear, but not 100%.  Does that include pcs that start out in the scene?  I assume with most of theses things, the mostly correct answer is the GM decides(somewhat sadly).  So if the GM starts a scene with Sara's character, does her character take 1D Encroachment, or does only Justin's character when he decides to enter the scene after it's already started?  <br/><br/>EDITED: spelling, shitty syntax left intact                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433902/#Comment_433902" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T11:36:54+00:00" title="June 16, 2014 11:36AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2014 11:37AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I do have a question; so somewhere I was reading that when player character enters a scene, they take 1D Encroachment.

A scene starts with Sara in it, she gains 1d10, then Justin takes his when he shows up halfway through.<br/><br/>There are a couple powers that let you spy on a scene from afar, but since they explicitly do not save you from gaining Encroachment as if you had joined, I don't see much advantage in using them as opposed to just being physically there and in Stealth...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433911/#Comment_433911" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T14:25:52+00:00" title="June 16, 2014  2:25PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It makes sense to me that this is for every scene, but then again for some reason since Tenra Bansho Zero I keep thinking japanese RPGs are meant to have only 4 to 6 scenes per session...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
