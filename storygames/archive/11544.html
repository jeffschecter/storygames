If it belongs somewhere else, I apologize.<br/><br/>Last night we got together and, because our GM was out, we ran a one-shot of Danger Patrol.  Pete ran it, and I wound up playing what I think may be my favorite character I ever created, the Atomic Flybox Mac Mercury.  The following is what was inspired after the game; since its "in universe" it doesn't have the dice rolls, obviously, and since it follows Mac's perspective, it misses both my favorite moment of the night, which happened to Singapore Sam, and it nearly completely ignores Damien Dagger, who teleported off to handle a different threat.  Still, this is pretty much what happened to Mac Mercury all night.<br/><br/>I want to add something here, at least about the character creation in Danger Patrol: Every combination sounds awesome.  I really went back and forth on my character.  Since the episode was called "The Planet X Blues" I had sort of settled down to a Psychic Detective to keep in a noir feel (even though the game wound up not being very noir, I didn't know that at the time).  But one of the other players wanted to be the detective so I played around.  I really went back and forth between psycic, two-fisted, and atomic, and between daredevil, flyboy, and warrior.  But all the combinations sounded pretty awesome.  I think that's good for the replayability of the game - I'd love to play Mac Mercury again, but I'd also love to create other characters.<br/><br/>I believe there might be other perspective writeups coming, and some artwork.  If anyone wants to know how the dice rolls went for a particular moment or anything like that, feel free to ask and I'll try to recall.<br/><br/>(begin grainy black and white newsreel)<br/><br/>(credits and narration): THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MAC MERCURY, AIRMAN EXTRORDINAIRE!<br/><br/>(narration):  Mac  Mercury, member of the ever-popular DANGER PATROL, has kindly agreed to allow a film about his extraordinary life.<br/><br/>(stock footage of the Atomic Superman farms)<br/><br/>Mac was born in the last days of Earth, formed of years of crossbreeding the best traits from dozens of highly capable citizens, and grown quickly to adulthood in one of the vats of the atomic farms.  Upon reaching his full size, Mac Mercury had the key ingredient to this brutal practice performed upon him - the installation of the nuclear reactor in to his barrel chest.  The atomic power surged throw him, causing horrible scarring now covered by armor<br/><br/>(shot of Mercury posing in armor) <br/><br/>except for, luckily for his fans, his famous smile, left for him to shine his perfect white teeth at us all.  <br/><br/>(close up of Mac's smile)<br/><br/>Mac's atomic powers turned out to be perfect for piloting ships through all the dangers of the escalating atomic wars, and although cruel fate would cause him to start the last war that would destroy the earth, PERFECT HEROISM would allow him to redeem himself.<br/><br/>(interview with Hamilton Hawks)<br/><br/>"While it is true that Mercury was piloting the Enola Ray as it ran its fateful run that would start the atomic chain reaction that destroyed the Earth, there are important things to keep in mind about why the Danger Patrol would employ Mac.  Firstly, the Earth was doomed anyway; the escalating wars were ruining the planet, which is why the emigration to Mars was already underway.  Secondly, Mac couldn't break his programming.  He had to drop the bomb.  However, and most importantly, once freed of the impetus to drop the bomb, Mac was free to do what he pleased - and what he pleased was to use his ship's Photon Translocator to scoop up hundreds of citizens from the Earth and move them to the Ray, and join in the exodus."<br/><br/>(return to narration, with various scenes of Mercury's heroism on various adventures)<br/><br/>While Mac Mercury serves with all members of the DANGER PATROL, and indeed has served the Patrol since its inception, he currently works with a tight-knit team of heroes who he can truly call his friends - the mysterious, magical detective, Damian Dagger... the fists of freedom, Singapore Sam... and the brainy, brawny seeker of wisdom, Doc Tangent!  We sat down with Mercury and asked him about his latest adventure.<br/><br/>(Mac Mercury speaks over recreations of the scenes he is describing)<br/><br/>"We had gone to Planet X, beyond the orbit of Pluto, to investigate the possibility of a DOOMSDAY device that could DESTROY THE SOLAR SYSTEM.  Princess Alloura was... unreasonable, and things got heated.  I regret to say that I said something unforgivable and threatened her world, a threat no doubt bolstered by my terrible role in the destruction of Earth.  Though to be fair, the actions of the rest of my team probably didn't help matters.<br/><br/>We were captured by the forces of Alloura and were taken to their most ancient of court rooms, the Dimensional Volcano.  We were each isolated on precarious platforms above a yawning darkness that we were assured lead to only doom.  Sentenced to DEATH, we had no choice but to FIGHT OUR WAY PAST THE GUARDS!<br/><br/>While my team punched, blasted, and teleported their way around the guards, I was left without my main weapon; my ship.  So I attempted to use my martial arts training and ATOMIC STRENGTH on the guard attempting to shove me off the platform with an ELECTROTRIDENT.  I succeeded in knocking him down, but the platfrom LURCHED, and we fell towards the GAPING PIT that was possibly full of HOLES IN REALITY.<br/><br/>And then my friend Doc Tangent knocked his guard in to the pit, and that awoke the AIR SHARKS OF PLANET X!  Interdimensional beasts who swim through spacetime like a shark through water, there is no creature more dangerous in this or any other dimension, with jaws of death and RAZOR SHARP SKIN.<br/><br/>My platform was collapsing and I had no choice - plummeting to our doom, I fell on to one of the air sharks.  With a mighty cry to rally us, I proclaimed "I CAN FLY ANYTHING!" and gave a kick to the guard who was still hanging on to me.  He fell to his doom, but pulled the fuel line on my back up plan, my jetpack.  I wrestled with the beast to gain control of the flight, but his bestial instincts and the cybernetic implants the foolish scientists in the employ KING MORDUKE fought my efforts.  In the end, however, I *can* fly anything.  A quick glance at the field of combat and I saw my old friend, Singapore Sam, hanging off his platform and about to fall.  With my great ATOMIC STRENGTH, I rallied the thrashing air shark over to his position, and risking losing control, reached with one arm and caught my colleague.<br/><br/>We were not safe, for the jet fuel leaking from my pack had caught fire from a spark, and was burning ALL AROUND US.  But that was the least of our worries - the sharks were in a frenzy, and worse, bearing down on us was THE KING OF ALL AIR SHARKS, covered in the blood of Sam's brother, who it had just eaten.  Sam solved our problems and got his revenge, tearing out my remaining fuel tank and throwing it to the king shark, and then detonating it with his blaster.  The toss went wide, but the blast still blew the king shark to heck, and while it was dangerous, we also had the thrill of jumping from a flaming, thrashing air shark to the cliff and to safety!<br/><br/>Our jump was short, we were able to grab handholds in the cliff face.  Using my ATOMIC GRAVITY BEAM I was able to move my ally to safety, though my own hold was becoming more precarious.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, just then the BOMB CLUSTER EXPLODED.  To make matters worse, the explosions in this reality started to tear apart the rift in the dimensional volcano, and as the rift crew, our reality was in danger of being OVERWRITTEN BY ANOTHER!   The solution?  TEAMWORK!<br/><br/>Doc Tangent used his telekinetic powers to control one of the remaining platforms and use it to scoop up his teammates and ride the EXPLOSIVE SHOCKWAVE, even though his control was imperfect and we wound up UPSIDE DOWN.  Singapore Sam managed to use his martial arts powers to correct our orientation, and then I used my GRAVITY BEAM in a completely unintended way and steered the platform on to the Enola Ray's cargo deck.<br/><br/>(cut to Mac Mercury's winning smile)<br/><br/>That's right, folks.  I can pilot anything.  Even an inanimate object. (teeth gleaming)<br/><br/>(cut back to a recreation)<br/><br/>We had long since lost track of our mystic ally, who it turned out was battling the EVIL KING and his SLEEPER ASSASSIN DAUGHTER, but even he was part of the team effort, using a MIGHTY SPELL to close the threatening dimensional rift.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in the landing, I was knocked unconscious.  You may not know this about Atomic Supermen, but you should - we are very dangerous when knocked out.  Our defenses kick in and we should only be touched by a fellow atomic broadcasting an allied atomic signal.  My ship, still the Enola Ray after all these years, had its own defenses that had not properly recognized her crew because of our unorthodox entry.  At GREAT RISK TO THEIR LIVES, Tangent and Sam resuscitated me.  Awakened, I was out of control, still in defense mode, but Sam knocked some sense in to me, for which I still thank you, old chum!<br/><br/>But we had two last concerns - explosions all around the ship from the cluster of bombs, and STYGIAN ADEPTS using that moment to seize control of the Enola Ray.  Fire suppression, clever piloting, and A MASSIVE TELEKINETIC JUMPSTART ended the threat of the explosions, and clever words and flying fists ended the threat of the Stygians.  Dagger used his amazing TELEPORTATION ability to bring himself and his sometimes ally, sometimes enemy Alloura back to the Ray, and with Alloura subdued, we set course for the DANGER PATROL base on the moon of Titan.<br/><br/>(narrator)  We asked if we could get a brief statement from each of Mac's colleagues.<br/><br/>(Sam) "He saved my life, and I saved his, and we did what we needed to.  That's what being in Danger Patrol is all about."<br/><br/>(Damian) "Get outta my face."  (throws cigarette towards camera, vanishes)<br/><br/>(Doc Tangent) "We all play our part.  Mac's part?  Mac is a damn great pilot."  (Mac Mercury bursts in to frame)  "Sorry, old friend, but I need to correct you.  I'm not a great pilot.  I'm THE GREATEST pilot.  (flashes winning smile and a thumbs up)<br/><br/>(narrator voice, over spinning Danger Patrol logo) Just remember, everyone, the Danger Patrol are heroes.  And even Atomic Supermen can be our friends!<br/><br/>(closing music, credits)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257295/#Comment_257295" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-20T11:13:54+00:00" title="February 20, 2010 11:13AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2010 5:17AM by Storn.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Damian Dagger and the Dimensional Volcano Debrief<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b><br/><br/>[click]<br/><br/>"It is 4 o'clock in the afternoon Terra.  I'm aboard the Enola Ray after a most trying mission that is still ongoing.  But I thought since we are in transit, I would record this report for Danger Patrol debriefing.  Hmmmm... how should I start?"<br/><br/>"It definitely was a different gig than the usual insurance fraud or follow the spouse case... although I did get a bit over my head with a dame.  On Planet X.  Yeah.  Not my best move."<br/><br/>[pause]<br/><br/>"Being in the Danger Patrol sure is different.  I get to travel the solar system.  Meet exciting new people.  And have them try to kill me.  Maybe I shouldn't have slept with Daddy's little girl.  That looker of lookers, Princess Allura.  But what the heck, King Marduk was curtains.  She is gorgeous.  And I did get my hands on the super-sensitive infodisc she had sequestered in her bedstand."  <br/><br/>"But the afterglow wasn't exactly tender.  As you might have seen in Mack Mercury's visual report, she offered to throw us into the Pit of Infinity.  At electro-trident point.  Then she had the gall to leave.  Knowing my team is tops in the face of death, I slipped into the shadows of the 5th dimension and teleported to her side outside of the palace control room.  Tried to convince her of the error of her ways.  Maybe my hand on her exquisite neck would suffice in persuasion of a survival instinct, if her love and affection for me wasn't up to snuff.  Too bad we was interrupted.  Yeah.  King Marduk..um... <b>NOT</b> curtains.  Very much alive.  Very large.  Very pissed.  I have that effect on some folks.  Sue me."<br/><br/>"I guess things were getting a bit crazy back at the Pit of Infinity.  One really shouldn't chuck things into a Pit of Infinity.  Things have a way of balancing out and something comes back... toss in a fridge, you might get back a very hungry, very pissed Shadowgorn back.   One should definitely NOT put cluster bombs in the Pit of Infinity, but some brain surgeon did exactly that.  And guess what?  It went off.   All of 'em.  Danger Patrol never catches a break."<br/><br/>"So, Kingy here didn't look so good, bit peaked.  He didn't seem keen to tussle beyond a pissing match of words.  Princess Gorgeous seemed oddly compliant.  We had a bit of a mexican stand-off, I had her.  He had, well, a palace of goons, weaponry and Planet X was playing havoc with my magics.  And the bastard had some kind of Tport lockdown built into the palace...I couldn't get to the Enola Ray.  I tried.  But boomeranged right back to King Marducky's loving company."<br/><br/>"By then, cluster-bombed Pit of Infinity became the Dimensional Volcano belching into our reality.  See Mac's stu- um, er... thorough newsie.  This was bad.  Balls-nasty bad.  Even King Marmaduke thought it was bad.  Lucky for everyone involved, shadowy dimensional energies are kinda my stock and trade.  Kingy and Princess Beautiful gave me leave to preform the Rites of Dimensional Mending.  The control room of the palace kinda sucked for such a delicate Rite, but beggars can't be choosy.  I was on top of my game that day, maybe the most perfect spell I've ever casted."<br/><br/><i>[player note:  4 Successes, no Danger rolled]</i><br/><br/>"But the palace was still in being buffeted by pop-corn explosions of dimensional rift energies still in the vicinity.  I hoped the Tport lock was damaged as the palace started to fall apart.  I took Princess Hotpants and ShadowJumped to the Enola Ray.  Luckily, the 2nd time was a charm.  Or not.  I know the dimensional energies of the Enola Ray like I know my own facial hair.  After all, more often than not, it is home.  As I say this, from the same bunk that I reported my last case.  Y'know, this cabin could really use some art on the walls.  Um.  Anyway."<br/><br/>"Singapore Sam wasn't pleased to see Princess Knockout..and that is exactly what he did.  Knocked her out.  With one of his patented Shaolin sleepy-time moves.  Then things got all kinds of crazy.  Seems that nice, ol, King Marduk had rigged his own daughter to be some kind of perfume poisoner.  Doc Tangent was rambling on about phermones and such.  But we managed to get that under control.  Right now, we are on our way to Jupiter, to see what we can glean from Princess Lovely's infodisc.  And the team garnered some kind of insane Marduk plan about doomsday weaponry.  It is always with the doomsday weaponry with these despots.  You'd think they would come up with something new.  But classics are classics for a reason, even if the reasoner is stark-raving bonkers."<br/><br/>"Princess TooHottoTrot is cooling her delicate heels in the brig.  Actually, it was Commander Estella's quarters.  The only cabin with a feminine touch.  But with Doc Tangent's technolocks and my own mystic wards to keep her company.  And keep her there."<br/><br/>"That about wraps things up.  I'm sure something will hit the fan soon.  Then you will get to hear my dulcet tones again.  Til then?  End Report."<br/><br/>[click]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257298/#Comment_257298" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-20T11:41:59+00:00" title="February 20, 2010 11:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am really psyched that you guys had so much fun on Friday night.<br/><br/>Wish I could've been there.<br/><br/>Fun game re-caps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257322/#Comment_257322" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-20T14:19:41+00:00" title="February 20, 2010  2:19PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun stuff.

(I completely forgot about my jetpack until after I was on an air-shark and it was being disabled).<br/><br/>I never got to use "hold together baby" but that might be more how the game went then a flaw with the ability.  Actually, now that I think about it, I did use it... to hold together the telekinetically flying platform, so never mind.<br/><br/>I got to use my bonus die for flying fairly frequently, so no big problem with that.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you could feel could use work, but I thought it worked fine.  Any particular concerns?<br/><br/>In terms of general stuff, for most of the game, I really embraced the idea of this being "danger patrol" and took as many danger dice as possible.  As the game wore on though, it sort of became apparent that danger dice, since they have a 50/50 chance of accumulating danger, they weren't really helping defeat the threats.  Its possible we were doing something wrong, of course.<br/><br/>Not really a concern, per se, but I love how there's more room for other styles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257484/#Comment_257484" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-21T19:42:10+00:00" title="February 21, 2010  7:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jccohen</cite><br/><br/>Mac's atomic powers turned out to be perfect for piloting ships through all the dangers of the escalating atomic wars, and although cruel fate would cause him to start the last war that would destroy the earth, PERFECT HEROISM would allow him to redeem himself.<br/><br/>(interview with Hamilton Hawks)<br/><br/>"While it is true that Mercury was piloting the Enola Ray as it ran its fateful run that would start the atomic chain reaction that destroyed the Earth, there are important things to keep in mind about why the Danger Patrol would employ Mac.  Firstly, the Earth was doomed anyway; the escalating wars were ruining the planet, which is why the emigration to Mars was already underway.  Secondly, Mac couldn't break his programming.  He had to drop the bomb.

One more mystic ability would have made a big difference.   I did convince Pete that I could do a dimensional rift closing RITUAL, but that was pretty vague on what ROLE to use to do that (we settled on Agent, I think).  Of all the characters, I was getting the least amount of bonus dice from my abilities.  Luckily, I had bought Agent in at a d10, so I was able to do a lot of the convincing and skullduggery that my scenes seemed to gravitate towards.<br/><br/>I was the first one to forgo Danger Dice as the number of threats was starting to get ridiculous.  I made a couple of rolls, really trying to eliminate some threats because we had been doing this one scene already for close to 3 hours.  That felt too long to me.  Obviously, if you are going at a roll with only your d4 Role, you are gonna want to garner some Danger Dice.  But if you have a d12, d10, and a d8 or so, one seems to be better off NOT going for the Danger Dice... unless it is early in the conflict and you want to generate more threats or make ongoing threats more "threatening".  Or you are trying to push your character along hte Danger Track.<br/><br/>I just looked at the GM "job" chart and noticed under Danger 3, a GM "could" do a Danger 2 and Danger 1 threat reaction...namely raise one threat up, and inflict a hit on a PC.  I think there needs to be stronger guidelines/wording for when to do that.  Like maybe have a cap on Threats, no more than # of players plus 2 or something.<br/><br/>Also, there were a couple of times that I wanted to do kind of actions that really didn't affect Princess Allura and King Marduk directly... actions that I wasn't sure should mark off hits from them.  And when I did that, there wasn't really a guide to knowing how many successes I needed to accomplish certain things.  I can't quite remember what I was trying to do, but I did have that "i don't know this system yet" frustration at the table.  <br/><br/>Finally, our table was insanely good at throwing even more fuel on the fire with our Danger Dice Declarations.  Pete was left with a huge pile of stuff to use and some of it could be useful for Interlude, but I think it was more than we needed... not sure about that... that is just my rough guestimation.  Since we never got to the Interlude scene... I really want to play one, btw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jccohen" title="jccohen"><img alt="jccohen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jccohen">jccohen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257575/#Comment_257575" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T09:53:02+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  9:53AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I recall correctly, sometimes it wasn't even during our danger die declarations.

Creation is simple and the rules are pretty simple.  Just put together and go.  With the enclosed adventure idea (Crimson Apes) a GM can do a nights play with very little prep or forethought.  I mean that in a good way, even though it sounds mean.<br/><br/>Just as if 4 friends are sitting around you can grab a deck of cards and start dealing poker, or grab your game of Parcheesi and go, DP can just be grabbed and you can go "let's play.  now."<br/><br/>I'm not sure about how it would work for a campaign.

I've been guilty of that myself in the past. 1 hour is much better. The rules are designed so the GM can basically decide when a threat is removed (you don't tell the players how many hits something can take). So, ideally, the GM can pace things according to the clock instead of having to grind down every last hit point.<br/><br/>Being smart about when to add a new threat and when to do Danger 2 + Danger 1 instead is a key element of pacing, too. Maybe I need to add "USE SPARINGLY" to the Danger 3 move.<br/><br/>The other key thing is countdown threats. I need to highlight those in the text better. When there are several countdown threats in play, the PCs really need to take danger dice to succeed faster and beat the threats in time. Without good countdowns, they can just whittle away at threats and there's less pressure to add danger dice. Finding the right balance there has been more art than science for me, but I think I can come up with a system to help others do it.<br/><br/>If you were playing the (unfinished) beta version I sent to Pete, you should have gotten all the powers, talents, and special abilities for your character. That is, you don't pick powers anymore, you start with all of them. But maybe you played the older version where you had fewer things to start.<br/><br/>Thanks for giving it a try. I really appreciate the feedback.<br/><br/>EDIT <a href="/forums/profile/jccohen">@jccohen</a>: Yep, "pick up" RPG is what I'm going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jccohen" title="jccohen"><img alt="jccohen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jccohen">jccohen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257583/#Comment_257583" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T10:10:51+00:00" title="February 22, 2010 10:10AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we were playing the older version, as I had used my copier to make multiple copies of the rules, so everyone could have a copy.
