I think it would be a great Facebook game but I lack the computer programing skills to make this happen. I'm looking for a programer interested in working on the project. They need to know about interfacing with facebook. I'm paying so I'm serious about this. I think it will be real fun.<br/><br/>If you know someone who has the skills (or if you have the skills) please <a>email</a> me at hamsterpress@gmail.com. Thanks!<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
