John Harrison</a> on worldbuilding.\n<blockquote>Every moment of a science fiction story must represent the triumph of writing over worldbuilding.<br/><br/>Worldbuilding is dull. Worldbuilding literalises the urge to invent. Worldbuilding gives an unneccessary permission for acts of writing (indeed, for acts of reading). Worldbuilding numbs the reader\xe2\u20ac\u2122s ability to fulfil their part of the bargain, because it believes that it has to do everything around here if anything is going to get done.<br/><br/>Above all, worldbuilding is not technically neccessary. It is the great clomping foot of nerdism. It is the attempt to exhaustively survey a place that isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t there. A good writer would never try to do that, even with a place that is there. It isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t possible, &amp; if it was the results wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be readable: they would constitute not a book but the biggest library ever built, a hallowed place of dedication &amp; lifelong study. This gives us a clue to the psychological type of the worldbuilder &amp; the worldbuilder\xe2\u20ac\u2122s victim, &amp; makes us very afraid.</blockquote>\nThoughts on how this statement relates to gaming?<br/><br/>--Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63853/#Comment_63853" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T16:09:14+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  4:09PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, but they aren't concise.<br/><br/>Uh ... see Polaris?

If we want to see the back of the old fart, let's not give him deathbed support by having an opinion about him. The worst thing we can do is set ourselves up in opposition. Cultural opposites depend upon one another. They prop one another up. Something Tolkien failed to understand that when Barad Dur falls, Gondor falls too. <b>Let's not make the same mistake. Let's not be one thing or the other, Tolkienista or Next Waver. Let's be something new.</b>"</i><br/><br/>As someone who loves Tolkien and Harrison, I have to wonder just how much worldbuilding Harrison did for something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viriconium" rel="nofollow">Viriconium</a>. There's an interesting thing to know about Harrison. You can read one of his recent novels, like <em>Light</em>, and then read one of his short stories from the late 70s, and you find many of the same objects -- the same names for weapons, technologies, you name it. And even though the publishing of <i>Viriconium </i>and <i>LIght </i>are separated by decades they share a surprisingly large number of themes and motifs. As if he makes it up as he goes along and once he does, doesn't see the need to invent a new reality for his next fiction, it's all one -- his body of work.<br/><br/>To bring it back to gaming, I'm pretty new to RPGs I admit, but what I'm wondering is if we'll see at some point a game developer, similar to Harrison, who puts out game after game that doesn't try to do something new every time, mechanically or thematically, but that expounds on the same mechanics and theme, maybe in subtly different ways, always circling around some big central issue unique to the developer and always striving for the heart of it. <br/><br/>When you think about it this isn't much different from Tolkien's work after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63874/#Comment_63874" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T20:41:10+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  8:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worldbuilding <em>is</em> fun -- and as a designer, I don't want to steal that fun from the players.

He was able to use that hige library of Middle Earth in his head to flesh out the setting in little ways that tantalise the reader, giving little hints of a wider world beyond his heroes' adventures, but without ponderously belaboring all the details and mapping out every last nook and cranny. An element of the world is discovered as it is encountered, and fleshed out only as importance dictates. Many, many places, people and things go untouched or unexamined. In the end, it's all about the main characters, and <i>their story.</i> (I'd argue that the same applies to Frank Herbert.)<br/><br/>I don't think the "Worldbuilding Problem" stems from Tolkien but from his imitators.<br/><br/>Though I don't know quite how to relate all that back to roleplaying.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63880/#Comment_63880" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T21:41:54+00:00" title="April 13, 2007  9:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A fine statement!

Is there worldbuilding in Dogs in the Vineyard? I certainly think so. Vincent provides an inclusive picture of how the structure of the game's reality works. He describes the social norms, the culture, the attitudes, and shows how they are interdependent. That's worldbuilding to me, and darn good worldbuilding. Now if Dogs had falling rules, or a long essay on the mysterious caverns in the mountains, that would be hogwash, since the game isn't about those things at all.<br/><br/>What about Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities? The entire book is a sort of exercise on worldbuilding. Or does it stop being worldbuilding when you stop following natural laws and start troping them instead?<br/><br/>Here's an exercise.

It's being called noirporn psychosexual drama at the moment.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a series of laundromats, pool halls, casinos and alleyways, populated by strangely 2-dimensional and distinctive characters. It's a poorly told story and the PCs have the task of finding their narrator and killing him (it's a him) so that it can end. The game is about finding out what resources you have, but more importantly finding out how social interactions work. There are distinct ways to get clues out of a social situation, and there are distinct ways to fuck up a social situation and cut down your own scene. You're told none of this, and you aren't told what the glass bead point pools are tallying.<br/><br/>The game relies heavily on having character archetypes that are pretty damn constructed and consistant. If they already don't know what they're going for or how to get it, then the things they DO have to lean on need to be airtight.<br/><br/>The game also relies on consistancy in tone and the motifs that are getting "charged".<br/><br/>That all said, there will be no overarching story, no landmarks, no histories.<br/><br/>My question is... is this world-building? Negatively so? is it situation building?

I have a lot of respect for Tolkien's obsession, and I do not want to step into it and start fiddling about. I won't even see the films, because it would disrupt the delicate web of imaginings I've built up over thirty years.<br/><br/>I don't think LotR is a very good book. I think Tolkien was a mediocre writer of fiction, and I say this having once loved the book to death. The world itself was his artistic creation, not the spinoffs.<br/><br/>Glorantha is a slightly different case. It was a world built for gaming (though it was also built as part of Greg Stafford's journey through mythology). It is far less a whole than Middle-Earth, and has a lot more room for fiddling--by design. <br/><br/>Yet it has accreted so much substance over the years that it is now a textbook case of how such a world is difficult for the uninitiated to enter. I hear over and over again how it is intimidating for people without twenty or thirty years experience. I myself feel the weight of the setting when I play, and it is only my vast experience with it that allows me to manipulate it as I choose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63937/#Comment_63937" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T23:38:06+00:00" title="April 14, 2007 11:38PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>There are setting things that shout "Use this to<i>do things</i>in your game!", to me.

I'm not picking on you particularly, Mes, indeed you should feel proud that you gave the most succinct version of this oh so very wrong answer to the question of how much worldbuilding to do: "just as much as you need to build a compelling and coherent narrative."<br/><br/>That is one style of story (and one style of game). There is another, there are many others. <br/><br/>Let's not forget that Tolkein is not an aberration here, in fact he is barely a blip on the radar once you pass beyond the geek canon. There is Faulkner. There is O. Henry's "Cabbages and Kings".  There is Dickens (good christ, a Dickens SHORT story kills this idea dead). There is Jan Morris' "Last Letters From Hav" and Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon series. Italo Calvino was already brought up, but why not Les Miserables and Moby Dick? Moby Dick has a whole god damn whaling textbook in it, and it's not by accident. What's all that stuff in "All The King's Men" about Cass Mastern?  How come a whole chapter concerns a turtle crossing the road in "The Grapes of Wrath"? "Tristram Shandy" and P.G. Wodehouse worldbuild for laughs and as a joke on you. Terry Pratchett does it in footnotes and insert chapters, Doyle had Watson tease us with irrelevant Holmes cases that he never intended to detail. The Leatherstocking series worldbuilds to establish tone and as an independent support for the theme. "House of Leaves" does it to creep you out. All of these works contain extensive (and varying) segments, sections, chapters, volumes, not having anything remotely to do with anything anyone in the normal everyday world would call the narrative of the work.<br/><br/>It's a modern conceit that "oh, the setting is really irrelevant once you get beyond the immediate situation of the narrative". And although following that conceit does create a certain kind of story, a kind I really enjoy, it is not the only kind in the world, nor, I'll wager, the most prevalent kind.<br/><br/>What this means for gaming is that worldbuilding is fun and good even when it has no impact on any kind of "narrative" at all. It's just a different kind of fun than straight narrative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63943/#Comment_63943" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-15T01:10:45+00:00" title="April 15, 2007  1:10AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>JD, how does any of that rubbish relate to gaming?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dotan" title="dotan"><img alt="dotan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://corky.net/dotan/log/images/yylpa.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dotan">dotan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63950/#Comment_63950" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-15T06:50:39+00:00" title="April 15, 2007  6:50AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems to me to be tied in directly to what a friend has called the issue of "Orcish Yodelling" - a complaint that any detail that isn't relevant to the action of the game is time-wasting fluff.<br/>\nThe parallel in a game design context is the assertion made by Luke Crane and Jared Sorenson that any setting detail that isn't expressed in the game mechanics is superfluous noise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63951/#Comment_63951" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-15T07:11:31+00:00" title="April 15, 2007  7:11AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>JD, how does any of that rubbish relate to gaming?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What this means for gaming is that worldbuilding is fun and good even when it has no impact on any kind of "narrative" at all.

I haven't seen a game yet where the world that's built can't easily be altered (and I haven't ever played in a game where this kind of customization is anything but awesome for the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63970/#Comment_63970" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-15T12:33:24+00:00" title="April 15, 2007 12:33PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> The only issue comes, I think, when the world that is built is at odds with the narrative, where it undermines the narrative in some way.

I think in some way both positions can be reconciled, but I can't quite put it together yet.<br/><br/>I don't think the example of, say, <i>Moby Dick</i> is the same thing as what Harrison means. Or maybe it is. You'd have to go through those works and try to understand what structural purpose those sections serve. I'm pretty sure that they're not there just so the reader can wallow in them.<br/><br/>Part of what's niggling at my brain is the distinction between what a writer does with their work and what fans do to the work afterwards. Harrison says in another essay:\n<blockquote>The great modern fantasies were written out of religious, philosophical and psychological landscapes. They were sermons. They were metaphors. They were rhetoric. They were books, which means that the one thing they actually weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t was countries with people in them.<br/></blockquote>\nNow, he's talking specifically about fantasy and SF, as I understand it. You can certainly extend that in some ways to <i>Moby Dick</i>, where the great white whale is a symbol of Ahab's obsession. But Melville wasn't making up an entire world from scratch; he was describing one. <br/><br/>If you were to play a 19th-century whaling game, it wouldn't <b>be</b> <i>Moby Dick</i>. But when people play <i>Star Wars</i> or LotR, they are attempting in some way to literalise and colonise those worlds. There's where I see the difference. It's the difference between creation and pastiche.<br/><br/>For game worlds built for play, that would be some sort of as-yet unquantified difference between a world that gives you room to play--asks you questions, as it were--and a world that has all the answers already. That's not necessarily directly related to the quantity of material, but it seems to me that the greater the quantity, the greater the risk of nailing down all the answers. Perhaps that's why, for many people, the SW prequels deadened some of the original magic. What was all fairy-tale metaphor in the original became prosaic reality in the prequels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63992/#Comment_63992" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T01:06:06+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  1:06AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>they are attempting in some way to literalise and colonise those worlds</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Why do you suppose that people are doing this?

I happen to agree with him on an aesthetic level.<br/><br/>There's no intrinsically moral element to it either way.

(i.e. many of Brian De Palma's films are pastiche's of Hitchcock).  In contrast, I feel that colonized works are more often transformative.  i.e. I don't hear people say that Kirk/Spock homoerotic fiction is a "pastiche" of Star Trek.  (They use other words to insult it, like "abomination". :-)<br/><br/>A lot of my games have been colonized in the sense that they stick to the literal continuity of an adapted setting, but have different themes and/or metaphors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WiredNavi" title="WiredNavi"><img alt="WiredNavi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://ttp://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q3/WiredNavi/YepEyeballs.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WiredNavi">WiredNavi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64072/#Comment_64072" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T14:34:59+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  2:34PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2007 2:35PM by WiredNavi.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite><br/>It should be noted that Tolkien didn't actually publish all his worldbuilding.

Also, I personally like the Elvish poetry, and regardless of one's taste for such a thing, it seems odd to count that as a point against in <i>this</i> context, where the question is (or sems to be) about whatgets center stage. In LotR, the Hobbits get center stage, and those they meet in their travels are the major supporting cast. The poetry is there to fill various narrative needs-of-the-moment, whether that need is "foreshadow the epic nature of Aragorn and Arwen's love" or "show that lots of songs and stuff are sung at Elrond's house."<br/><br/>If you just don't like epic verse, that's an entirely separate problem. Lots of people do, and it's a big part of medieval and ancient times. I like it. Shreyas doesn't.

You took a shot at Tolkien RE: poetry. I gave my opinion on that. If I missed the subtle nuance of your scathing critique of JRR's work, well, I guess you'd better expand beyond the pithy one-liner next time.<br/><br/>I personally find this kind of critique of LotR quite tiresome (as tiresome as others find the poetry, I guess). Yeah, it's got poetry. By and/or about Elves. So what? Dune has stillsuits and terraforming and a manipulative religious order. As varous folks have argued in this thread, none of those things need cross the line from "fleshed-out setting serving the narrative" and "worldbuilding," where "worldbuilding" has, for purposes of this thread, a negative connotation of bad literature suffering from a preponderance of (or obsession with) extraneous detail.<br/><br/>LotR is all about the Hobbits. Dune is all about the Atreides. Not worldbuilding.

There is too much, like, nostalgia wrapped up in that stuff. See above: I love epic poetry; JRRT's poetry is just <em>bad.</em> Apparently, however, I am not allowed to say this. If we don't talk about Tolkien, what examples of cancerous worldbuilding do we have in genre fiction? What examples of story-serving worldbuilding? I would like to contrast McKillip and McKinley vs. Weis and Hickman, but somehow I feel like that is squashing flies with the family atomics. Setting that pang of guilt aside, here I go:</p>\n<p>There is a very striking thing that Robin McKinley does in <em>The Hero and the Crown</em> and <em>The Blue Sword,</em> which is, she <em>doesn't</em> tell you specific things about the world she obviously has a very clear mental picture of, and this has the cool effect of really drawing in the reader - you're being treated as a member of the club, as it were. You get an idea of what the cultures she is talking about are like, by contrast between the novels (the viewpoint character is from a different culture in each, and so they treat different things as foreign and surprising), but you aren't exposited to about the culture the viewpoint is a member of.</p>\n<p>So, that's worldbuilding used in a really powerful way, to me. You're treated as a part of the world, rather than as a spectator to the author's genius.</p>\n<p>Patricia McKillip does a different thing, where it seems like she makes up things as she goes along, not necessarily filling in any details that aren't going to be needed. Reading <em>Winter Rose,</em> you get a pretty strong idea of what the village Rois lives in is like, but it doesn't have a name or environs; there is a "the city" in the distance, maybe, and sometimes people go away but we know not where; it doesn't matter. In the <em>Riddlemaster</em> trilogy, there seems to be a world with, like, geography and history, until you pause and think about when elements get introduced, and then you notice that precious few things get discussed before they pop up on screen as part of some immediate crisis.</p>\n<p>And that's non-building.</p>\n<p>So, now, Weis and Hickman used to write D&amp;D novels. I don't know if they still do. I don't want to talk about those; they are baggagey. Instead I'll talk about their Death Gate series...which reads like D&amp;D novels. You can almost feel them filling in their worldbuilding Mad Libs..."Hey, in this world, what do we do to make elves weird?"</p>\n<p>"What if they dress like butterflies?"</p>\n<p>"Okay. Dwarves?"</p>\n<p>"Hm, dwarves like machines. What if they worship one?"</p>\n<p>There are like essays about magic systems in these things, and maps and racial monocultures and the whole shebang. Each book is little more than a frame story for a lot of exposition for the w00t aw3x0m3 setting in it, and I feel like the fiction suffers for this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64134/#Comment_64134" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T01:38:47+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  1:38AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, now that you've actually <i>talked about something</i>, there's something for me to discuss, hopefully without overly generalizing your one-liners, or whatever. So cool.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I feel like there is a lot of Tolkien apologia in this thread, and that makes this topic really hard to talk about.</blockquote>\nPersonally, I'm kind of wondering how <i>I</i> can talk about this topic if my comments are going to be filed under "Tolkien apologia." Emily asked, "So what about Tolkien?" Not much to go on, but I thought, "Hey! I know about Tolkien. I like Tolkien. I'll share what I think about Tolkien and worldbuilding." I did that, and got a silly little dig. Yes, silly. Not silly because of who's right or wrong about the poetry, but because it says nothing while having the appearance of a rebuttal.<br/><br/>So, here we are. I say that Tolkien avoids Harrison's complaint about worldbuilding, that Tolkien's use of setting detail in LotR serve the story. Whether the poetry's <i>good or bad</i>, is completely different. What do you think of Tolkien's <i>use</i> of the stuff WRT Harrison's beef?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>If we don't talk about Tolkien, what examples of cancerous worldbuilding do we have in genre fiction? What examples of story-serving worldbuilding?</blockquote>\nI find this question kind of funny, because, well. . .\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Weis and Hickman</blockquote>\n. . .you answered your own question. I confess I haven't read any of their stuff (haven't read McKinely either, though I <i>have </i>quite enjoyed McKillip and am reading the second Riddlemaster book right now), but based on your description: yeah, that's prety bad. I think it stems a lot from the whole imitative rut that a lot of post-Tolkien fantasy has gotten mired in. "Well, Fantasy, y'know, it's gotta have Elves." "Yeah, and Dwarves, and, uh, wombats." "Wonbats, really? Not Hobbits?" "Well, we don't want to be yet another tired Tolkien pastiche." I mean, Tolkien himself didn't do this Madlib thing. 'Course, he had it easy, coming first* and all. But still. If the Weis/Hickman model is archtypical of the problem, I don't see how Tolkien qualifies.<br/><br/>Bringing this around to roleplaying: your example here is perfect, which is no surprise considering how entwined their writing is with the roleplaying hobby. It strikes me that I've seen this exact kind of thing in so many roleplaying campaigns: "Oh, well <i>my</i> elves/orcs/hobbits/wombats are different, they're nuclear physicists/tribal/cannibalistic/three-headed." Like, that sort of thing (along a number of vectors, like the nature of magic or wierd physical aspects of the world) is the <i>selling point</i>, the "why would I want to play in <i>your</i> game and not somebody else's" kind of thing. It's world-first and not character-and-situation-first. I guess to some degree this has been unavoidable, given that we play published games and thus have certain assumptions built in the game, like D&amp;D will have Elves, Dwarves and Halflings, and these assumptions will be either accepted or rejected/modified ("I don't do my Drow like in the book.") So thinking on the matter is sort of channeled. And that sort of thing is a legitimate goal, sure. I like Droog's suggestion that it's a more antropological goal than literary. I'm not sure what else to say about it except to point out that it <i>exists</i> as a goal, and can clash with goals that are more drama-based.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*Of <i>this</i> fantasy tradition, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64135/#Comment_64135" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T01:55:44+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  1:55AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All,<br/><br/>I just wanted to point out that Harrison's comments make a lot more sense if you don't look at them as litcrit -- "Stories that contain worldbuilding are shit!", I'm pretty sure he's not saying that -- but as advice to budding authors, who often seem to get so hung up on the worldbuilding aspect of fantasy fiction (an aspect which is admittedly a ton of fun <i>for the author</i> to work on) that the more essential competent of telling a compelling story becomes an afterthought. Readership of novels which only succeed in detailing a meticulously-detailed fantasy world will always be limited to a niche fanbase. A good story, however, has universal appeal. If you wish to be an author by trade and get paid for this stuff, you generally want to write a story that's interesting to more people than interesting to a few people. There's <i>totally</i> a market-oriented value judgment in there, moreso than a critically qualitative one.<br/><br/>Like, I don't think anybody's actually claiming that stories include any sort of worldbuilding are bad. A great many good stories contain amazingly through worldbuilding. Many other good stories totally neglect worldbuilding. But a crap story that contains very good worldbuilding is still a crap story. Right?<br/><br/>Also, I like that JD is willing to stick to his guns and bring in examples from greater literature, but I don't think any of those things are the same thing at all as what Harrison's referring to. We're talking about a phenomenon which is particularly endemic to what the book trade calls "science fiction" (which includes fantasy fiction). "Worldbuilding" here is more than simply providing a lot of details about the world the characters inhabit, it's about <i>making up</i> a world that does not exist, a world where, maybe most importantly, no one has any business telling you, the creator, that <i>that's not how the world really is</i>. Which is, you know, something you face when writing "literary" fiction. Melville didn't conjure up that world of whaling out of his own imagination.<br/><br/>Substitute "creative freedom to play God" for "worldbuilding," because they're synonymous. Awesome for you the creator, but maybe looking suspiciously like self-absorbed narcissism to someone else, especially if you can't be bothered to deliver the rest of the goods, and especially when you're expecting people to pay you for it.<br/><br/>So, what's any of this have to do with gaming? I think the phenomenon is even <i>more</i> endemic in RPGs, as evidenced by oh-so-many fantasy heartbreakers which go into great detail of a (usually, but not always, Middle Earth-like) fantasy world setting, but fail to actually provide adequate tools for either telling compelling stories in that setting or playing a  socially interesting game with it. It's the "industry-standard" method of throwing money away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64137/#Comment_64137" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T02:10:26+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  2:10AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>. . .you answered your own question.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Heh, well, sure.

There is no Yoknapatawpha County, in space, with hobbits, or just with coffins floating down the river and Joe Christmas sneaking into the kitchen for some food. In some ways Yoknapatawpha County is more outlandish than Middle Earth and certainly it is just as much Faulkner's as Middle Earth is Tolkeins. There is no Yoknapatawpha County to visit and say "well, Faulkner got that wrong" or "good on Faulkner, that's exactly right." There is no Coralio, Lake Wobegon, Hav, or Interzone, and anyway, as we all know, the borders of speculative fiction are blurry. There's magic in 'Almanac of the Dead', Italo Calvino is a fantasist, 'House of Leaves' is rightly shelved under horror, and Dickens' most famous story has not just one ghost, but four, and a 'dark future', too! (Although there isn't too much "extra" worldbuilding in it, unlike many of his other works.)<br/><br/>Every narrative - 'science fiction'/fantasy or no - requires some worldbuilding, even if we treat 'ownership' as the key part of worldbuilding. The characters the fiction describes do not exist and never did the things the creator says they did. Well and good. What's at issue here is how much worldbuilding that's beyond or outside the narrative is 'right'. Some stories have lots and lots, some stories not so much.<br/><br/>Whether this is what Harrison is referring to, I sincerely doubt. My whole point all along is that he doesn't know what he's talking about and the things he says are awful are, often, really really awesomely good, because it includes more than he thinks.<br/><br/>Been thinking of other media too - when a prop master or an extra wrangler on a TV show or movie puts something or someone in the background of a scene, it usually has nothing to do with the narrative. It's all about the question 'would it make sense in this fictional world for this item or person to be here doing this?'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64161/#Comment_64161" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T10:12:14+00:00" title="April 17, 2007 10:12AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obviously, if something is made to primarily be a narrative story -- or self-defined as a narrative Story Game, then the story should be primary.  <br/><br/>However, I think there is a full range of works from works which are only story with virtually no invented or described world -- to works of nearly pure world-building with virtually no narrated story.

One of my gaming groups is centered around Harn play, which is about as detailed as any fantasy world out there.  (We play other games, but we regularly return to Harn and our mailing alias is "harners".)  And lots of my other games have also had copious notes, like the Vinland game, where we used multiple pages of family trees and topographic USGS maps in the game.  I ran several Star Trek campaigns which had detailed notes on how doors operated and such.  I'm sure there are more obsessively detailed games out there, but I think I've been at least close to that end of the spectrum.  <br/><br/>So, I don't see it as a danger sign.  <br/><br/>Also, I don't associate it with being behind the scenes and un-shared.

One of my gaming groups is centered around Harn play, which is about as detailed as any fantasy world out there. (We play other games, but we regularly return to Harn and our mailing alias is "harners".) And lots of my other games have also had copious notes, like the Vinland game, where we used multiple pages of family trees and topographic USGS maps in the game. I ran several Star Trek campaigns which had detailed notes on how doors operated and such. I'm sure there are more obsessively detailed games out there, but I think I've been at least close to that end of the spectrum.<br/><br/>So, I don't see it as a danger sign.<br/><br/>Also, I don't associate it with being behind the scenes and un-shared. In nearly all of the detailed-world games that I've been in, players were welcome to contribute, subject to some editorial negotiation and agreement. For example, Jim, who's GMed several of the Harn campaigns, also had maintained the<a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/harn-religion-team/" rel="nofollow"><b>Harn Religion Team</b></a>pages, which were formed from contributions of lots of people. Indeed, I think the most detailed worlds are collaborative works -- for the obvious reason that many people contributing can create a lot more detail than one person.<br/><br/>I did go on to say "But a sign isn't always the whole story, sometimes it really is a group just having a great time with a GM that they really are grateful to for putting all that work in."  I did also say a sign "to me" was a danger sign, I entirely appreciate to others it may not be and may not be for very good reason.<br/><br/>The reason why "to me" it as a bit of a danger sign, is that I have seen a few times people posting about how they're not having fun and don't feel anything they do matters, but the GM has put all this work in and they don't want to spoil it.  That's not so good, one time on the Forge of all places there was a chap playing a d20 Star Wars game in which they accomplished very little but in which the GM had five lever arch files of detailed Star Wars star system details.<br/><br/>But I put in that bit about a sign is not the whole story, because it isn't.  That was precisely my point, what may be a danger sign to me may in fact be a great game and the only way we can really know is by asking the participants.  My concern was that there seemed to be an assumption from many in this thread that this was intrinsically a bad thing, I think that's a dangerous assumption.<br/><br/>People tend to post about stuff they're unhappy with, when I see someone posting about massively detailed worldbuilding in their game it's often when something has gone wrong because the happy folk often aren't posting about it.  What typically has gone wrong is the players being closed out of the creation, the kind of thing you talk about may be greatly more common but it gets posted about less probably because happy contented people feel less need to post online.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64245/#Comment_64245" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T02:18:46+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  2:18AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>As it so happens, Earl Grey<b>is</b>in fact my preferred cup of tea.

I think it is something of a conversational barrier -- i.e. if you have a massively detailed world, any posts you make are likely to be incomprehensible to someone unfamiliar with the world.  So that does create a divide between insiders and outsiders, but conversations among insiders work fine.  For example, the Harn forums are pretty active, and while there are some tendencies that I see as danger signs in it, the whole seems no less problematic than any other RPG forums.<br/><br/><b>NOTE:</b> <i>Edited to try to fix the darn blockquote from upstream, but it isn't working.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64302/#Comment_64302" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T15:41:03+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  3:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>As an aside, Ken Hite gave a related seminar at ConQuest Sac this past weekend on the subject of using history and alternate history in world-building.

But that's just it, whatever the comment means in relation to RPGs depends on you, and getting into arguments over it is kind of pointless at least until you point to a particular game or an experience that you apply it to. For example, I'll bet a lot of people read the comment as a manifesto against fat sourcebooks that require you to read 300 pages of background before you can play--or instead of playing. Others take it as a snide F-U to the idea that a reader (of a novel) or player (of a game) has a right to reject hokey, contrived continuity, and should instead be grateful to witness the self-indulgent emoting of the author/GM/fellow player.<br/><br/>Personally <b>my </b>demons make me to react mostly in the second manner. I mean, I've spent a lot of time rolling my eyes at the bulk of Hollywood's product (film &amp; TV) and for me <i>part</i> of attraction of RPGs is that they provide a platform for "interrogating" the fiction. This may be an end in itself; however it's also a way of ensuring that there's a robust foundation for everything else. Ultimately, when it comes to coherent worlds, the richer the better <i>as long as it fits inside the participants' heads</i>. The world (in a broad sense, including genre tropes and the like) is like a universe of signs; more signs, more connections, greater potential for building layers of meaning. (This is why viewing world building only in terms of constraint is mixed up--just as with language and culture, you don't create meaning out of nothing.)<br/><br/>Take a look at the comment by Elf Sternberg: "The world is a character. It has wants, most of which involve stymieing the reader. It has a personality, it has impulses, and it has principles. You don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t need to get everything absolutely right; you simply need to not get anything wrong. Sometimes, yes, that means that in the writer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s notes for a story or a series, he makes up and writes down details about the biochemistry....Worldbuilding is the responsibility the writer has to create a context that hangs together from the beginning of the work to the end." I agree with all of this, and add that "world" can be empowering to the participants in a game just as (I'm sure many here will agree) concrete systems regulating player-character interaction can be more empowering than running a game based on pure social negotation. On the other hand I'd hypothesize that for RPGs, trying to nail down any element of the fiction in infinite detail at the beginning can be stifling. To begin with it's impossible, second if the language analogy holds any water, the expressive power of a fictional world also comes from its slippery adaptability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65167/#Comment_65167" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T18:50:25+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  6:50PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off let me note that what I get from most of this is that it's more about being a good or a bad writer, not really about worldbuilding.  I even see a few folks running into "well I don't like extensive worldbuilding in my fiction but I like this fiction so what he's doing with his world isn't worldbuilding ('cause I like it)."  Not to say that inserting worldbuilding into a narrative might be a stumbling block for some but I find the hypothesis to be a little shabby.<br/><br/>Worldbuilding in gaming is about buy in.  It's about SIM.  It's about the world as a character (all which was mentioned).<br/><br/>I think that my problems with worldbuilding has nothing to do with how good a game is or isn't, it has to do with time.  It take me and my players less time to make up our own shit than it does for me to read over volumes of canon.  But that is the only problem in my opinion.  I love Artesia.  Artesia is all about the world.  It's relavent, deep and full of story ideas.  But without that 300 page buyin most folk go "well, it's pretty."  I've had a GM debate incescently against Artesia's focus on setting then hours later ran a Glorantha game for me.

It's inevitable that you're going to have to explain something to the reader during the course of the book, otherwise you're looking at a very bland and formulaic book. The trick is to explain it to them by example, demonstrate how it works rather than put in vast treatises about the different types of Hobbit (I'm looking at YOU, J.R.R. Tolkien, stop giggling at the back there!)<br><br>That isn't very practical in an RPG book since most players and GMs will want to know fairly precisely how everything works, though it may be an effective device to use in a game where the players haven't read that book. The alternative is to have a genre-specific game instead and let the players and GM make up their own world. While this is quite valid and there's nothing wrong with it, as a regular Indie game critic I do get very sick of games that promise an amazing new experience but then don't give you any details to work with, expecting the player to do all the legwork. At the very least, such a game should include a solid set of guidelines (or preferably a customised mechanic, like Ganakagok's world map or Diaspora's Clusters) that aid and enable the players and GM in making these decisions.<br/><br/>Put bluntly though, somebody will have to do some world-building unless your game is all about what the players do in their everyday lives already.

The original 1970s TTA books were one of my first science fiction loves, but even as a kid, I could tell that the text was mostly gobbletygook \u2014 some obviously didn't match the pictures, for instance (an alien Pan Am starship?). They also told a history from 2000 to 2100 that included a space war between Terrans, Proximans, and Alphans, exploration of the space between and around them, commercial trading (obviously) and travel. Full of good stuff, and only very hazily explained. The descriptions, when they held together at all, made mysteries, not answers. When, during development, I asked one of the authors of the RPG how they were treating the material, he said, basically, "Well, you have to define everything to play it as an RPG, so we resolved all the mysteries."</p>\n<p>He was incorrect. Role playing games are creative endeavors. What you need is a <em>system for knowing</em>. Writing down all the answers is sort of the brute force approach. Principled ways to make stuff up a) puts the fun back in the hands of the players and b) makes a practically infinite font of goodies.</p>\n<p>Let's say we've got Enchivur, a fantasy world, and the protagonists are the only adventurers in the world (as is the case in Lord of the Rings). As the game designer, I've created a map, and it's got latitude and longitude. When you move somewhere on the map, you roll a 2d6, modded by the 12 latitudes and longitudes. That tells you what the people are like who live there. That's 1,728 possibilities, with neighboring people usually being similar to their neighbors. Much more manageable than a list of 1,728 cultures (most of which won't exist in play anyway), isn't it? Now, let's say that there are options so that, when you've already heard of a people in these parts, you can write down five things you've heard about these people, and prioritize them, with the highest priority most likely to be true, and lower priorities less likely to be true, but none of them are certain. And you get names not from the locals (though you can ask) but from the last people you visited, so all the people have names like "Snake Eaters", "Never-Get-Off-Their-Horses", and "Loose Women".</p>\n<p>What I've done as a designer is made constraints that make sense for this world, but given players fruitful directions to create stuff with them. The canon itself is unreliable \u2014\xa0maybe we even have to flesh out where rivers and coastlines really are. But what <em>is</em> reliable is that you have a way to figure out who's where.</p>\n<p>Canon is fun to write. But that doesn't mean it's the only, or even a good, way to systematize players' knowledge of the world of the fiction.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280031/#Comment_280031" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-11T08:49:33+00:00" title="July 11, 2010  8:49AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Other stories don't have that relationship - the world is wider and bigger than any dumb little player character in those stories.  Others still have yet a different relationship - Dirty Secrets' "Your town, last week" is worldbuilding of a very effective kind.

The key in the development of the Human Contact setting is that they give you the tools with which to do stuff, and when something is apparently forbidden, the question is <em>how</em> you do it, not <em>if</em>. The idea is to always be coloring all events as vividly as possible.</p>\n<p>An example from a few weeks ago:</p>\n<p>A character, an Academic, is on a clandestine mission from wealthy Country A to cheap labor source Country B. Border guards in Country B thinks she's a spy plane and shoots her down. She survives, and winds up with limited contact with Academic technology. Within a few weeks, she starts genetically modifying the local crops. I ask, "Wait, you wouldn't have had your whole genetic engineering lab with you on your little ultralight airplane, which in any event, was shot down. You've probably got your standard toolkit, sensors, and weapons. How are you doing this?" So we wind up, the five of us, describing how she's genetic engineering the crops \u2014 the interfaces between the tools she's got and the local tools, how she's teaching people how to use them, and ultimately, how those techniques color the process.</p>\n<p>Because there was setting material, we knew what we had to make up on the spot.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280068/#Comment_280068" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T01:47:39+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:47AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Well fleshed-out, complete, defined settings and books full of information can be very cool, but most often they just make it<i>that much harder</i>to make up stuff that works.

I have never suffered from this problem with any gaming system for the simple reason that if I don't like a game's setting but I do like the rules, I can ignore the world-building and make my own. But look at it another way: every more complex rule in a game should have examples to support it, so why not an example setting to explain how world-building works? It doesn't need to be 'official' or even the only one in the book.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is, if existing canon is getting in the way, you don't have to use it. However it's a lot harder and more time consuming to invent a canon for something that doesn't have one.<br/><br/>Thinking further about my previous statements, there is a parallel between novels weaving world-building into the narative with RPGs. It's when you get a system like Vampire or the classes in D&amp;D wherein character creation or other rules intricately involve biology, world politics and other subjects in their justification for certain bonuses and penalties. Your vampire clan, your character's career, it's ALL world- building because it assists in creating an image of what the world around the characters is like.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280242/#Comment_280242" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T20:57:03+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  8:57PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the excerpt posted here, I would say Harrison is full of shit--<i>unless</i> (as Brian offered above) he's talking about obsessive worldbuilding spunked into the narrative, not to move the story forward, provide <i>necessary</i> grounding for the reader, or punch up the drama, but to show off the worldbuilding itself, even if showing it off bogs things down with exposition or needless detail.  It's the same problem presented by writers who research a ton on a particular subject and gratuitously slather their findings into the story to show off what they've learned.  Some writers I respect fall prey to this impulse, as Neal Stephenson did repeatedly in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cryptonomicon</span>, a book I otherwise enjoyed the hell out of.  But I didn't need or want or enjoy wading through pages and pages of a description of the guts of the Enigma machine.<br/><br/>Harrison is objecting to bad <i>writing</i>.<br/><br/>There's a lot of great books and short stories that do deep fantastical or SF-nal worldbuilding.  I just finished Kate Elliott's <i>Crossroads</i> series, for example, which was a huge, well-delivered setting with distinctive geography, culture, and vocal mannerisms.<br/><br/>Deep worldbuilding for the sake of worldbuilding can be and is enjoyed by gamers just fine, <i>viz.</i> successful franchises Exalted, Forgotten Realms, WoD, Tribe 8, Dresden Files.  Amazingly, a lot of groups engage in original worldbuilding as a shared creative exercise.  The results might be crap from a dramatic fiction standpoint, and maybe you and I would rather chew our own eyeballs out rather than read a book set in them, but hey, if it floats their gaming boat, cool.<br/><br/>A quick comment to Levi--one person''s constraint in a fictional world may be another''s inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2814/against-worldbuilding" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2814/against-worldbuilding" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2814/against-worldbuilding/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2814%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F2814%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
