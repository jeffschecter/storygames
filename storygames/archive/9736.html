But I ran Dogs in the Vineyard for Rone, one of the hosts, and he absolutely loved it. He loved playing so much that <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://atomicarray.com/dogs-in-the-vineyard-aa026" rel="nofollow">Atomic Array interviewed Vincent and myself about Dogs in the Vineyard</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm listening to the interview now. I'm very excited for Vincent. I suspect many of Atomic Array's listeners haven't heard of or played Dogs so it's a great opportunity to expose Dogs to a wider audience.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://atomicarray.com/dogs-in-the-vineyard-aa026" rel="nofollow">I hope you guys like the interview!</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBetween this and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9704" rel="nofollow">our MonkeyDome interview</a>, I'm on a podcast whirlwind tour this week!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have much planned for Gencon this year but I'm hoping to run Dogs and a few other indie games for people who have never played. I'm probably attending a few paizo and d20 parties where I'm going to offer to run.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked me why I talk up Dogs so much. Hell, I talk about it way more than anything I'm working on or am involved in and I don't benefit from promoting Dogs in any way. I think it is an amazing game and I want as many people to know about it as possible. It's one of the few games that delivers consistent fun every time I run it. And I've run it a lot!<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ephealy" title="ephealy"><img alt="ephealy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/121/nV4JX8G6B8000.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ephealy">ephealy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216174/#Comment_216174" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T06:31:25+00:00" title="July  3, 2009  6:31AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you don't have much planned for Gen Con, then maybe you'll run us through a town... ?<br>\n<br>\nIt was great talking with you guys, and an honor to have you on our 1 year anniversary show.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216252/#Comment_216252" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-03T12:13:51+00:00" title="July  3, 2009 12:13PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Ed.

It's only downside so far is that Rone and Ed don't talk enough on Open Design Podcast.
