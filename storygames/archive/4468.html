And it was all done in-character, which is interesting. Actually, the fact it's IC might reduce its usefulness a bit.<br/><br/>One of the big things about Ars M for me was that it made the PCs part of a society. Sure, the magi live seperately from medieval society as a whole, but (a) they have their own society (the Order) that they belong to, and (b) they still need to make a place for themselves in wider society, to co-exist with it. The scenario possibilities are just endless, and for someone rooted in the "find the evil artifact, kill the big bad guy" mode of thinking, as I was, a huge revelation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101150/#Comment_101150" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T16:33:09+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  4:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have the 1st edition on my game shelf today.

But back then, reading a 250+ pages pdf was a fucking chore and so I never did anything with it or really delved into the rules. Then, recently, I bought the fifth edition core and was extremly disappointed with this ... <i>monster</i> of a system. It looked like somebody took a relatively simple base mechanic and thought "Well, let's see how far we can overcomplicate this". Or maybe it was designed on a dare or something.<br/><br/>So now it's standing amongst my other games and I feel kinda bad about buying it, which hasn't happened often.

And in doing so it got increasingly mechanical and nitpicky, and less appealing and fun. The hand-wringing over magic resistance, in particular, makes me wants to rip out my own soul.<br/><br/>There was a 4th edition supplement called The Mysteries, which tried to introduce more "authentic" medieval magic into the game. But the way it worked was by coming up with a whole new set of complex magic rules (whole chunks of which were genuinely brilliant) and adding it over the top of the current magic rules (which, by 4th edition, were not sylphlike and wee). It didn't replace the existing rules, it was just piled on top of them. Faintly terrifying. <br/><br/>I sometimes think about running a game again, but I'm sure I'd find it frustrating. But taking covenants, the order, the seperate character roles, troupe play, and shared situation creation as a core, and then coming up with a new conflict resolution system, I think there's a fab game in there more suited to my current tastes.<br/><br/>Actually, that thought sets me a-tingling.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jerry D. Grayson</cite>Once characters were made and the campaign began it quickly became apparent that the game rewarded seclusion and study over any other activity.</blockquote>\nI don't quite get this.<br/><br/>This was very much what companions and grogs were about - while the mages study, the companions are left to run things. And there are some situations that *need* a magus to resolve, so you have to go retrieve some from the lab. Plus there are built-in reasons for magi to leave the lab: vis, components, interactions with other covenants, and tribunals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Fricker" title="Paul Fricker"><img alt="Paul Fricker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Fricker">Paul Fricker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101201/#Comment_101201" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T04:33:07+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  4:33AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's 1990 or 89 and my wife (probably still girlfriend) and I are driving down from the North around Birmingham (UK) and we pick up this hitch hiker. We get chatting as you do, and he evangelises on Ars Magica. So I buy it and end up playing a 10 year campaign and having some of my best roleplaying experiences with it. That was partly due to the time in my life, before kids, when we'd get together with friends for a weekend every month and play several games. <br/><br/>I felt uncomfortable about the 'real history' thing so I set it in a fictional land, heavily influenced by Thomas Covenant, Lord of the Rings, Earthsea and so on. One of the best moments I had was when one Magi felt so neglected by the rest of his covenant that he turned up secretly to a grand tribunal to represent his covenant. The other PCs gave him such a hard time that he ended up locked in a prison cell for interrogation. Tensions were running high and we broke from the game and went out for a walk. On return the PCs went in to get the Magi only to find that his player had chosen for him to take his own life. The frustration on the part of the interrogators and the drama of the scene were intense. <br/><br/>The story wrapped itself up eventually, and I've never managed to return successfully to the system, I've tried a couple of times.<br/><br/>In terms of system, it was flawed and I was always tinkering. But it captured the feel of the game and the setting so very well - probably best in 2nd ed. The whole troupe play idea was brilliant. We did swap GMs once, but I don't think we were truly ready for that.<br/><br/>We had downtime where the Magi studied, sometimes for a couple or years.<br/><br/>I never met that hitch hiker again, but I'd like to shake him by the hand and say thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101204/#Comment_101204" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T04:53:09+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  4:53AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Fricker</cite>I never met that hitch hiker again, but I'd like to shake him by the hand and say thanks.</blockquote>\nIt sounds like you were visited by the angel of roleplaying.

I'd use it in a second for any game with power disparities between characters as long as there was something akin to seasons to promote rotation.<br/><br/>I think the last two editions looked like they had the "inmates running the asylum" problem, where the most dedicated, hardcore exclusive segment of the fanbase seems to have had the biggest say on how it evolved. 2nd Ed was quite freewheeling in terms of assumptions for setting. 3rd had a lot of jarring sub-WoD things (not tons and tons, but enough) and 4th-5th seemed to really be about the setting and bells and whistles instead of core ideas. John Nephew seemed to realize that the game was getting like this when I asked him about 5th.<br/><br/>Plus, I think Ars' magic system is getting a little long in the tooth, honestly. It could stand to be a little more focused and intuitive. I'd also cut the number of spells by quite a bit. 5th is a bit better in this regard, in my opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101209/#Comment_101209" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T05:15:07+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  5:15AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There were some fantastic books for the series, though.

For a trad game this had a lot going for it.  I have every edition.  I think this was really a story game for people fed up with the standard fantasy tropes (but still wanted to play fantasy).  The goal was to explore the world of closeted academic with power.  This is worth awesomeifying.<br/><br/>Gosh, my first Story Game?  Ars was close if not IT.  Troupe style is what pushes it over the edge for story gaming if not a gentle nudge.

Matching the unbridled opportunities of characters and setting with the current rules just breeds disappointment for me every time.<br/><br/>When I read some of Vincent's discussions of how he would create a <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=86&amp;show=yes#first" rel="nofollow">game</a> inspired by it, I was electrified.  But since I'm still waiting for him to finish it, I've had design and begin playtest of my re-interpretation which I call <a href="http://hargifex.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Quadrivium</a>.  I'd love to share the current revised version of the rule, but it's slow going to convert my handwritten notes into a document for others.<br/><br/>So since, I'm being lazy, I'll call Vincent out.  When I spoke to you at GenCon, you mentioned you had conquered the issue that stymied you previously (e.g. multiple characters under a single player's control acting at contrary purposes) but that the game had changed significantly.

I've played every edition but 4th, and my best experiences came with 2d, back in the mists of time.  I remembered it as being awesome and not THAT hard to get up and running, so I suggested running it for my current group, using 5th.  I have a pile of 2d and 3d edition books and material, but used 5th because parts of it seemed to offer real improvements on the core rules.<br/><br/>Mistake...from hell.  We met every two weeks, we had one rulebook, and all the players were newbs to it, two having only DnD experience and some WoD experience.  It took us *months* before characters were ready.  One player dropped out--the rest figured they'd put X amount of effort in, so they wanted to stick it out.  They're still clueless on the rules, and it's the kind of game where in order to play through the downtime, you have to know something about what you want to do and how you want to do it.  I really resonate with the comment here earlier that the game rewards magi withdrawal from play.  Plus, the crunch is fairly high, with plenty of unique modifiers, die roll formulae, and special cases.  If we continue, we're going to have to spend a lot of time to become comfortable with the system, much less achieve mastery.  Players are definitely into their characters and want to keep playing, though I wonder if that'll continue to be the case once we hit the downtime challenges for Study, etc.<br/><br/>Great characters, cool setting, wedded to a system so opaque and heavy that nobody but me groks it.  Most of the players are casual, rules-light, story-oriented, and ALL of them could give a fig about rules so long as things make sense and offer sufficient structure.  In an ideal world, I'd like to refactor the system side into something like FATE or Reign while keeping the flavor of magic and the setting, but I'm not sure I'm up for such a massive redesign effort.  Keeping the Techniques and Forms progression seems central.  The Covenant and troupe-style play isn't really a system thing, so I'm not worried about those parts.  I also agree that a social conflict resolution mechanism would be a key addition--having played through innumerable council brangles that dragged on forever.<br/><br/>I think it's true that the hardcore grognard mindset has come to dominate the design philosophy.  IMO Ars has become a game geared to its own die-hard veterans, but it's not that accessible to players outside that circle.  If you're an Ars fan, 5e has many parts that fit together elegantly, and it offers enormous density and tons of cool story hooks in the setting.  All that said, I wish I'd chosen something different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101284/#Comment_101284" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T10:47:14+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 10:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2007 10:50AM by Chris Gardiner.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really interesting stuff, Blake.

Ars 5e is intricate, like a complex clockwork mechanism.  The point about Mysteries is true, too, that supplements tend to expand on the magic angle by introducing new and different permutations and styles that function almost independently of the core Hermetic style.  The rule density is breathtaking, and from a subject matter perspective it's all fascinating and loaded with cool (One example: the Tytalan sect that contacts the shades of the Titans to harness a form of Goetic magic) that I just want to go nuts with it.  But the system continues to get in the way with all these limitations and special case applications, and my next reaction is to throw up my hands in frustration.

To have troupe style play you need a system to hand off intervals of play for your magi (seasons) and the magi/companion/grog divide, especially as far as the collective ownership of grogs.<br/><br/>Social conflict resolution seems to me to contradict one of the basic charms of the game, which is that you, the player, make actual legal arguments based on what's codified in the setting instead of handing it off to systems. 3rd had some great listings of precedents that you could actually use to argue a case. Now if you had a system that didn't offload that it might be different, but it's not the kind of thing that would be simple to raft in while keeping those characteristics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101346/#Comment_101346" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T15:42:55+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  3:42PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I own both 4th and 5th editions, and I agree that in many ways 4th is better, although the system has been simplified and streamlined in 5th.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it interesting that no one has mentioned the magic system so far, to me it stands out far more than troupe play and covenant design, it is the finest mechanic for magic I have ever seen, not the perfect system for magic in any game, but the perfect execution of the magic in the setting, a beautiful marriage of background and mechanics.

I even think, back then, we were a little intimidated by the ideas and did not think you could run a game that way. For us late 2nd and early 3rd edition were firmly played because we liked the "pseudo medieval world" and the magic system (eventually we even played a game set in the 1600s).<br><br>There was one attempt at troupe style play and it fell apart for the reason I always believed it would. A player attempted to use an Item that was introduced by the main GM in one of the co GMs scenario's. Now the co GM had no idea what the item was capable of, neither at this point did the player, however the main GM who was playing this knew that the effect would essentially end the co GMs plotline. This put an end to our attempts at "Troupe Play" for many many years. However my point is this, no system will help with "Troupe Play", unless that system is more to do with who runs what plot strands and where. <br><br>When I did do "Troupe Play" again I simply said that any game that had anything to do with the covenant and its magi on official business was mine and mine alone. Therefore the co GMs had to run "non Arc" plots that were more involved with self contained events. Eventually some where run "along side" the main plot thread. For example I may have run a complex game of intrigue at a covenant for a few weeks and brought it to a close (but not a climax), then a co GM would say "six weeks ago the mages went to council, you find yourselves involved in the Doisetoep  Tourney".  However even though we acted a little braver it never really worked for the group.<br/><br/>I do think that a good social conflict system would help with a lot of the aspects of the game, I disagree with Malcolm Shepherd on the issue of "using precedent" as in my mind there are not enough of them. Even then you could use a skill like Hermetic Law and make it a part of any social conflict system - allowing those who have it to use "cite precedent" as some form of method of persuasion to win an argument. I also like the idea that at any time in a "social conflict" one of the players can use the "go for certamen" tactic if they think that will play up their strengths. Though to be honest I never liked certamen because it took people away from the social aspect of the game as more often than not a strong mage with a good certamen would always win any argument if the Law of Hermes stated it was an official way to solve one.<br/><br/>I have a strong affection for Ars Magica and have always believed the weaker parts of the system were present because the design goal was more about magic than anything else.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101352/#Comment_101352" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T16:55:33+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  4:55PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bartmoss</cite>A player attempted to use an Item that was introduced by the main GM in one of the co GMs scenario's.

But, to be blunt, I think this is partly because most other magic systems in RPGs suck, and Ars M looks great by comparison. It's faintly maddening that Ars M has been widely regarded as "the best magic system in gaming" for, like, 15-20 years. And it's changed little in that time. Can it really not be improved upon? (Rhetorical question, not aimed at anyone)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for it perfectly mixing system and setting, I'm not so sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to use words like "actual" and "historical", here, with regards to magic. I'm not a believer in the genuine occult power of magic - I'm just referring to those accounts, evidence, and records of magical practices from history that we can see.<br/>\n<br/>\nArs M Hermetic magic looks very little like actual magic from that period history, and a lot of effects that genuine magic focussed on aren't very achievable in the Ars M system. Cursing is a big one. Sure, Ars M lets you give someone boils, but if you want to curse them so their first love will have a tragic fate befall them, you're stuffed). Also blessing.

The Verb/Noun thing is a genius structure for freeform magic, but the specific verbs and nouns it uses are a bit crude.

There are cases where the framework butts up against its medieval cosmology awkwardly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also the fiddly issues: Magic resistance, and what it does and does not apply against, has always been a point of contention. There's the terrifying complexity of it all, once you start accounting for all the circumstances and modifiers. And there's the fact that lots of magi (and an entire house!) are all about ways to break the laws of magic...and there's no rules for breaking the laws of magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Ars M's magic system did three things very well:-<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n1) Freeform (to a degree) magic.

This is a biggie, and you see it more in the lab and character creation rules than in the magic system itself. But the ability for players to customise the rules that governed their own magus' magic was fantastic: being better at certain times of day or year, being able to craft a unique talisman, etc. Here the rules combine with character in a really nice way. I'd like to see more of this.<br/>\n</ul>\nI wish there were more great magic systems out there. I've heard good things about Unseen Armies, but never played it. Heck, D&amp;D;'s Pact magic (in the Tome of Magic) is about 3 inches from unmitigated brilliance. The king is Mortal COil, I think: it's utter, utter genius, and lets you create subtle, atmospheric, satisfying magic systems in play with an ease that's kind of mystifying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Ars M's magic system is good - hang on; I'll rephrase that: I think there's a good system <i>in there</i> clogged with a lot of detritus.

The whole enterprise of the game is about playing people with anachronistic perspectives. <br><br>I also think you're conflating mythology with historical occult practice. People in fairy stories curse people to have tragic love affairs.

Again, medieval magic in any form is not really the game's objective. There are chunks of it you can raft on for flavour, but non-Hermetic magic in the game has always been pretty much a form of magic that did next to nothing, cost a lot and sucked, comparatively speaking. I think making the jump to pure fiction for everything to do with the order is probably one of the reasons the game has survived for so long.

The aesthetic of balance seems to be a great motivator for people to talk themselves out of having fun, and I have no problem with effectiveness being clustered in certain areas. It actually makes extended play more fun by providing a frame of reference for character strategies. For instance, in the old Mage, conjunctional Correspondence rituals were some of the most potent spells around. In play, that meant that characters worked hard on developing clever applications and countermeasures and ramped up the in-game sense of danger considerably.\n<blockquote>I think Ars M's magic system is good - hang on; I'll rephrase that: I think there's a good system<em>in there</em>clogged with a lot of detritus.

The game talks about Form/Technique a lot, but the instanced application of them as game mechanics are actually very shaky and have only recently left the realm of "make shit up in this category." This is not in fact much of a system, though it shook boots in its time. 5th fixes this in a very scattered fashion which is still problematic when unified, non-just-make-shit-up systems exist.<br><br>(Off Topic Aside: One of the things I loathe in games is when people talk or intimate about how clever their game is in the actual text. It's one of the major turnoffs for me in the way the Burning games are written. These kind of glad-handing jerkoff passages also *work really well*. People really do repeat this stuff verbatim in discussion. One of the major aesthetic decisions I've made s avoiding this kind of thing in my work and it's ended up being a real sacrifice. I don't write WW books about how cool you should think Splat X is for example.)<br><br>There is a difference between the role of a system as a conceptual framework for narrative effect and as something that provides output that plus into game traits (buffs, damage, etc.). Ars spontaneous magic needs work on the latter, in my opinion. Once again, though, not everyone wants that kind of unified approach.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101412/#Comment_101412" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T07:00:31+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  7:00AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The trouble with real medieval occultism is that a very large percentage of it is incomprehensible gibberish, and it's not at all clear how you'd game it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, there definitely needs to be a Monster Manual for the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon" rel="nofollow">Goetic demons</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101419/#Comment_101419" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T09:16:49+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  9:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as co-GMing goes, any GM having a plot, at all, will break it.

If I could somehow streamline the magic system while preserving the color and the elements listed above, I think I could make the shared setting work, and the troupe style play would follow if the group cared to go there.  I don't know much about Mortal Coil, but if I refactor the system, I will have to account for character conversion.  Part of me wants to try the Dark Ages Mage system (very freeform in comparison) as a foundation and merge it with my Wushu-FATE bastard hybrid.  It might work if I use d10.  Anyone care to enlighten me on Mortal Coil?\n<blockquote>D&amp;D's Tome of Magic actually uses these guys as vestiges of ancient beings you can bind into yourself to emulate their powers and myths.

The books about the Houses are packed cover to cover with this kind of cool...along with a titanic load of special case supplemental magic rules.<br><br>So how would we awesomify Ars?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101434/#Comment_101434" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T12:32:26+00:00" title="October  6, 2007 12:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll just report my group's experience with Ars Magica, I decided to propose Ars Magica as a compromise between traditional games and story/hippy games (one of the other players was making noises about running a NWoD or a D20 game, which made me feel ill, so I suggested Ars Magica as a compromise) <br><br>We spent two 4 hour sessions building characters, the covenant, and sketching out some world background as a group... and we still hadn't finished. This was pretty fun, but also kinda alarming to me.<br><br>Four of us promised to GM on a rotating basis. The first two ran a session each, and then the last two reneged and passively failed to organize or run a game, causing the experiment to collapse. I think there's maybe some kind of lesson here about rotating GMs on a session by session basis. It's only going to work in accordance with the least enthusiastic player. Unless everyone is equally and highly enthusiastic, there can be a problem. My current feeling is one should rotate GMs scene by scene, not session by session.<br><br>The rules clutter sapped my spirit to keep the game alive and hound people to live up to their promise to GM sessions. I was happy to let it die in favor of trying other games instead.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101440/#Comment_101440" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T13:52:51+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  1:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>I'm interested in what you think does it better.</blockquote>To do so, I have to point out what part of its system (or what ideas in its system) I like: Broad, freeform magic. That's it. That's what attracted me to Ars Magica, originally.<br><br>Other systems that have broad, freeform magic without AMs complexity are, for example, Mage the Awakening and Mage the Ascension. I don't really like either game, for reasons other then their magic system, but freeform magic they do well, with much less complexity.<br><br>Another, although pretty different approach, is Nobilis. Again, the system allows broad and very freeform magic and could easily be adapted for a more conventional magic system and its about as easy a system as it gets.<br><br>The problem I have with AMs magic system is that, ultimately, a lot of it is, IMO, pointless for what it sets out to do. (And what I want out of it, obviously.) I've often read by people who like the system that this complexity is somehow "necessary" for this free-ranging magic style, but as other games show, it isn't. IMO, a large portion of the system could be cut out and streamlined, without losing anything in robustness or usefullness, while being much less work.\n<blockquote>Many times that is blatant and annoying overkill that has to be ignored to make the game flow but sometimes its a lifesaver that other games just can't offer.</blockquote>A system that has to be ignored "many times" to make a game fun is a badly designed system, IMO.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101443/#Comment_101443" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T14:32:31+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  2:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would really like to read Vincent's old posts in the Ars Magica mailing list. <br><br/>Vincent, did you save them?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101447/#Comment_101447" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-06T16:12:44+00:00" title="October  6, 2007  4:12PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder...whether <i>Heroquest</i> might work....<br/><br/>This might entail thread derailment, so I'll keep it brief.  Keywords would work the same.  Use...hmm..."Vulgar birth"..."House"..."Via" (for wizardly occupation, maybe)..."The Gift" for personalized magic traits.   I could lump the Arts under the additional keyword "Hermetic Magic" and keep the Art scores all about the same, including adding the verb+noun Latin bits.  To cast a spell, a character would need to match the spell's level as taken from the book...you could probably keep the spell descriptions and even effects as well, if you wanted the crunch.  Alternatively, just use the Arts as described, throw in a bonus for "formulaic spells" and keep the division the same for spontaneous effects.  Lots of bonuses for using wizardly foci and occultist jargon.  Throw away the spell lists except as inspiration, and go!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

GURPS has a combat system that I often ignore when it would be detrimental to the flow of play, so when your knight wades through the mooks they just get scattered without a roll, that doesn't make it badly designed, it just means I have to think about when to apply it.<br/><br/>The Ars Magica spell design system, for example, doesn't need to be invoked in full every time you spont something minor (though many Ars GM's are the anal retentive types who *will*, sad to say), but it still does its job well when you *do* try and design a spell in full.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101503/#Comment_101503" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T06:40:08+00:00" title="October  7, 2007  6:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *shrug*<br/><br/>I disagree.

I've had players who loved to tinker under the system's hood, but my current group is all about story and character and could care less about detailed mechanics.<br/><br/>My take?  In its current incarnation, Ars is hard to wield without embracing the detail.  Put another way, there's a lot to hand wave past unless you (collectively as the group) are willing to dig into the minutiae.  Maybe it's just a sign of my limitations as a GM, but I find ad libbing past a sheaf of rules details hard to distinguish from fiat.  I'm very comfortable being spontaneous, but the system has enough fiddly bits and formulae that the players can see all over their sheets, it's tricky to cut to a personal interpretation of what subsystem to blow off.  Especially, I might add, when the players are trying (casually) to learn the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101537/#Comment_101537" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T12:48:52+00:00" title="October  7, 2007 12:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I agree that Ars Magica players are, largely, not 'play it by the wire' sorts, they are usually methodical, history obsessed, and keen on systems, overly keen one might say (if you are not one of them).

Obviously, this is only something of a platonic ideal, never to be reached (or even wanted) in reall life. But I do want a system that doesn't just "fade into the background" or that's just used now and then when people feel like it. I want the system to be there and do its part of the heavy lifting too, a system that takes our input and prints out awesomeness and much and as often as possible.<br/><br/>This is probably related to my distates for "just fudging it". I'm one of those guys that wonder "Why did I just spend 3 hours making characters when half of the time these things will be ignored or freeformed anyway?" or "Why did I bother buying, learning and explaining this game when I won't use it at its fullest?".<br/><br/>I don't need many rules but every rules should have its plce and be active at the table, shaping play and producing fun.\n<blockquote>Is there a system for magic that you feel gets closer to what you would like, and can that system be used for Ars Magica? People have mentioned Mage, which is certainly related and also looser. Nobilis miracles certainly have a similar feel but are again less crunchy in calculation.</blockquote>I'm a big fan of the Nobilis approach, with stuff like "Create", "Change"... simply being steps that are available at a certain level. I also don't mind the abstractness, quite to the contrary. Often, solid-but-abstract rules are more adaptable to what happens at the gametable while still giving a good framework for communication and creation. <br/><br/>Another system I'm very fond of is the above mentioned Heroquest, which I too have thought about using for something Ars Magica inspired. (Ars Magica, powered by HQ, would be an awesome thing, IMO.)<br/><br/>In a way, I think (large portions of) my preferences boil down to this: I prefer simple and abstract rules able to cover virtually anything I throw at them. Specific subsystems that differ from the general system are ok, but I prefer them to be used before play, like when you design a Chancel, but not so much for actual play where they negate the advantages of the unified resolution system. (Something like Simple and Extended Contests is cool, though.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101623/#Comment_101623" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T06:03:03+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  6:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you wouldn't object to the sort of detail the Ars Magica system uses when designing formulaic spells (which are similar in complexity to how Nobilis handles the exact costing for a gift), since they are used as preparation for play, but they are too much to encounter in the process of play?<br/><br/>Of course this works to an extent in Ars Magica, you invoke complex rules to design a spell, but casting it is just a die roll.

(Less "Attributes", less special cases, less rules, more abstraction...) Not even close, IMO.<br/><br/>And as for the level of Detail: No. I'd object to that anyway, because it's that (to me) useless level of detail, with many subclauses and special rules, that create the criticised complexity in the first place. I don't need that.\n<blockquote>Even then I suspect it would be simple and elegant if only the details of each Form were not different!</blockquote>Yeah, if only they weren't different, and there wasn't that bothersome thing with levels and magnitudes, and if only they used a common scale so that Aquam 5 is as usefull as Animal 5 and they hadn't pages of rules for learning spells and found a way to neatly do Requisites and and and...<br/><br/>Sadly, every individual rule isn't actually bad, or hard, or stupid. Many are actually nifty ideas that I'd like to have at the table. But through five editions, the game has collected such a huge amount of those tiny nifty rules that the collective weight is staggering and their interplay is, IMO, boggling. I'm one of those guys that learn systems inside out and I'm good at it. I have an easy time doing so and I enjoy it. But Ars Magica just wasn't worth the work it would have taken to really familiarize myself with all those tiny rules. And non of the people I play with would have even tried.<br/><br/>Sad, really, because I'd love to play or run a game of Ars Magica light. Maybe I'll really do that HQ-hack someday.

How many times can we argue these points, the problem for us was this. They were there, we used them and then another GM comes along and says "damn its that tired chestnut that we all know the way out of...."<br/><br/>Also the reason why I am happier with a system approach to social situations in so I never have to sit through a predictable debate amongst players. I can usually guess who is going to come out on top in a council of mages played by players. Because the strongest personality wins all the time, its just they are at times not necessarily the "strongest social mage". Yes you are going to blame the players, and yes its the players fault for not roleplaying. But I have noticed that I only run games for humans and humans can be annoying like that. I am also a great believe in no one being perfect so I cannot hassle them too much.<br/><br/>However we are both fans of the game and experiences differ always!<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------<br/>General<br/><br/>As for the debate that has started about the Magic System. Well mmmm, the problem here is I am biased, I never had much difficulty with the Magic system. I know its not Medieval and its not based on real occult practice but I have a number of theories as to why.<br/><br/>1. Basing it on actual occult theory would taken a great deal of research and someone would have come along and pointed out to everyone how very wrong they were and it should have been done some other way.<br/><br/>2. The basic idea of the original game was to design a system in which mages could be mages. <br/><br/>3. It was originally designed at a time and in a place in which selling a game about demon summoning may not have been a good idea. By the time the 3rd ed supplements came out these problems had died down somewhat.<br/><br/>I always believed the Medieval setting was a little dodgy but that was down to the fact that they were trying to make it simple. The problem with the time was it was nowhere near as unified as people think, especially Southern France as depicted in 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>Ars Magic had its faults and I stopped playing it in any large way sometime after 4th edition was released, and oddly enough it was a fantastic campaign in which my character was all about trying to "go beyond the laws of magic". What I liked about it was I would never achieve the goal in the game, and if there had been rules for it I think it would have probably been something way to many people wanted to attempt. And after all it would have meant probably creating multiple magic systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bartmoss" title="bartmoss"><img alt="bartmoss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bartmoss">bartmoss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101706/#Comment_101706" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T14:51:41+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  2:51PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>*shrug*<br/><br/>I disagree.

Part of the game's appeal comes from playing intellectually modern characters dealing with primitive knobs from the other estates. I don't think the system is at odds with the setting at all. It's at odds with medieval Europe in the same way that magi  and covenants are.<br><br/>D) This really is a matter of taste. Some people are in the game for the system porn and notions of what they might do by flipping certain switches and getting pleasure from that, even if the narrative role of the result is relatively minor. This is a trait that some Ars fan shares with , GURPS, Hero, d20 and Burning Wheel fandom. <br/><br/>Lastly, I find the assertion that multi-GM games don't work sort of funny and sort of sad. I can see how someone might think that if they projected their stereotypes about how 90s era designs played or something. Ars Magica works petty heavily with the idea that the covenant has access to a bunch of interesting zones; it flows petty naturally to assigning GMs to different geographic or even metaphysical areas. This is a precursor of Vampire's urban network based play, where more linear adventures are really more opportunities to change relationships in the social network. In Ars, the politicking is primarily PC-based in the covenant, so relationships with the outside world do not have a hard-coded theme outside of explorin the differences between covenant magi and outsiders.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101743/#Comment_101743" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T19:47:02+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  7:47PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Malcolm,<br/><br/>My own assertion about troupe style play isn't that it didn't work.

For instance, I had a long discussion with a Nepalese gentleman about the Euthanatos where I eventually managed to explain to him that thee were deliberate changes from what he regarded as authentic Tantric practice because, well, the Euthanatos are a creepy fictional sect and needed to be divorced from an actual religion. On a less constructive note, Jim Densborough yammered about the inauthenticity of Atlantis according to his OTO-derived personal conceits, but was easily shut up when I referred him to Aleister Crowley's own writings on Atlantis.<br/><br/>Basically, much of the history of supernatural belief is largely the result of people making shit up, to the point where in many cases people are unsure if thins have been made up whole cloth or not, so in many cases main shit up is about as good as anything you might research.\n<blockquote>I always believed the Medieval setting was a little dodgy but that was down to the fact that they were trying to make it simple.

I was the main GM, having got the game organised, and two or three of the other players did some GMing periodically. That left another couple of players who never (or rarely) GMed. We took turns based on who had a cool idea for a story, or which magus had to go out of the covenant to gather vis or something. Those of us who did GMing used a system of reserving certain places and characters if we had plans for them, which worked fine. We even managed okay when GM A wanted to use something GM B had reserved, using the cunning technique of checking out if it would be okay ("I want to have the Duke do this and that during my story, is that okay with your plans for him?").<br/><br/>Overall, this sharing of characters and GMing duties really helped make that game one of my more fondly remembered ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101746/#Comment_101746" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T19:59:04+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  7:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Malcolm,<br/><br/>My own assertion about troupe style play isn't that it didn't work.

Then there are one or more beta storyguides, who either take one aspect of the setting (such as an enemy covenant), or run minor storylines in rotation.<br/><br/>The other, which is a lot less common, is to just rotate SG duties, so that everyone gets a go. This tends to me much harder because it doesn't separate the information that each SG knows from each other, which can make some sorts of plots (mysteries and conspiracies) very difficult.<br/><br/>The more general troupe play aspect is generally the same, players have a Magi each, a couple of companions and a pool of grogs. Players take grogs as needed, whenever one of their characters is not in the story, and will fairly often trade companions as well. Magi are almost always sacrosanct property of the one player though. This is always the big limitation of troupe play for me, players may play loads of characters but they only have one *real* character, the Magi, and invest in that what most people invest in their sole characters in other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101798/#Comment_101798" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T02:59:13+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  2:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for talking a bit about your experiences with troupe play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis bit particularly struck me:-<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Everyone pitched in to play grogs when their magi and companions were not present, which led to some of them building up some pretty deep personalities and histories.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nBack when I first discovered Ars M, I <i>never</i> would have assumed that sharing a character could have made that character <i>more</i> nuanced and interesting (an attitude which seems nuts to me now - how could it not?)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHituro,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, too.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">This is always the big limitation of troupe play for me, players may play loads of characters but they only have one *real* character, the Magi, and invest in that what most people invest in their sole characters in other games.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nCould you talk a bit more about that limitation?

And some explicit guidelines or even rules on techniques like Mike and Hituro mentioned - of 'reserving' campaign elements, asking permission from other GMs to use their stuff, and alpha/beta GMing relationships - might have made a big difference to me.

When the single owner character is also inherently more interesting (because he or she is a wizard, and has cool powers, and is in charge), and longer lasting (because the grogs grow old and die and the magi don't) then you will invest even more in that character and even less in the other one.<br><br>If the Magi were shared too they would still get more attention, I suspect, but that would be balanced out by being everyone's attention, and you could focus on the other character's development more.<br><br>Of course it also doesn't help that in the average example of troupe play the Magi go around doing something cool, the companions help and the grogs carry the baggage, stand around looking tough, and say "yes master" a lot <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Power imbalance in that way messes the troupe concept up. You aren't going to be able to invest a lot into a grog's development as a craftsman, or his grief for his lost wife, or his slowly falling in love, when the Magi are rushing you along to defeat the dragon and get its vis!<br><br>In my experience troupe play works a lot better when the characters you are troupe playing are balanced in terms of the power (social, magical, physical whatever) that they have in relation to each other.

Which is annoying because I have no way of doing so until at least January.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102021/#Comment_102021" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T13:07:43+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  1:07PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For all that I've been bitching about system, the group seems OK with taking a nice, long ramp-up time to learn the rules, so I think I need to rein in my dirty hippie impulses and let things go for a few seasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102071/#Comment_102071" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T14:52:22+00:00" title="October  9, 2007  2:52PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bartmoss, there are quite a number of play by email ars magica games on yahoo that you could look into                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103017/#Comment_103017" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T14:39:48+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  2:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Getting Ars Magica was a strange experience. I bought the fourth edition some six years ago. At this time I was more into traditional games and I loved the book, but I couldn't figure out how to play it. So I went to the previously mentioned Berklist and there were these people. <br><br>The Ar Magica Berklist is a rather interesting place. Bad in some ways, (these neverending fights between horrid know-it-alls) but also good in the way that a lot of the people writing there are (or were, I haven't read in a few years) are the Ars Magica writers. And there are a lot of writers for the game, they know a lot and they love the game.<br><br>But the funny thing was that I often felt that the game they talked about was something else than the published product. It was like the latest published version was a snapshot of what a certain group of people thought would be a good representation for newbies of what the real game was at the moment. It was like they could say, "It is really like this. But in third edition we instead said it like this due to something...". Like only the guys in the know really knew what the game was. Only me who had that experience?<br/><br/>The fifth edition is at least a better book than the fourth (certain parts of layout was just horrible in the fourth (I mean variable line spacings, what layout program does even allow that?).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150842/#Comment_150842" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T07:58:23+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  7:58AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know it is unfair to respond to comments that people have made about my work under the then-correct, assumption that people who write for Ars don't read this board, and that in that circumstance, the level of harsh that comes out in some comments is higher than otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, I'm not going to go through this say what I agree with or disagree with on a post by post basis, but I would really ask participants in this thread to consider my points, and I will gladly address any questions they want to ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I'd like to introduce myself, so you know where I'm coming from.  My name's Timothy Ferguson. I'm statistically the most prolic of the authors for Ars Magica 5th edition.  I'm a freelancer: I don't work for Atlas or have any formal legal relationship with them.  I am not, in short, a company shill. In the past 6 months I have made precisely zero dollars from Ars Magica, OK?  I hope to make a bit more when the Magic and Faeries books come out, but in terms of discolsure of motive for coming into this thread: I wanted to get back into Amber DRPG pbp and one of the Amber Mushes noted this board rocked, and I agree, so I've joined.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly play Ars Magica.  I mostly play it diceless.  I also used to play a lot of Amber and I'm getting back into it.  I also used to play a lot of Pendragon back in the day.  I have never been part of an ongoing AD&amp;D/D&amp;D3 campaign, although I played a lot of OD&amp;D/Mystara back in high school.  I will play some D&amp;D4 at GenConOz, to see if I want to try and write it, but since it needs a battle mat and minatures, I'm guessing I won't.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea that I'm a hard rules grognard is, and I'm sorry to be so negative in my first post, just silly.  The idea that the lunatics have taken over the asylum is true, but I'd put it this way: the community, who love the game, have taken ownership not just of how the game is played, but how the game grows, and have formed a corps of volunteers who tend to it and help it flourish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150843/#Comment_150843" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T08:00:57+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  8:00AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to ask those of you put of by needing to know history to look at the game again: the degree of historicity in the game is part of your troupe's play contract.  In my current PbP, we are doing the rise of the Hansa, in one of my previous ones, we were doing an alien invasion like in Stargate. Many of the authors have history interests, but the point of some of the sourcebooks is that we do the history so that you don't have to.  You want a trading game based in Northern Italy: we have your trading game based in northern Italy: you don't have to troll through the financial records of the Medici bank, because I've done it for you.  You want a game set in medieval Normandy?  Ditto.<br/>\n<br/>\nArs is complex - I agree.  I'd note, though, that I mostly play it diceless. The complexity is modular in the sense that you choose to buy in to the different parts of complexity.  IMC, I don't much use the magic item creation rules: they are too complex for my personal taste. Other things, and I'm sorry to be contrary, are not complex. Covenant design works like this: you pick story hooks or resources from a list.  Items on the list have a value of +1, +3, -1 or -3.  You have a certain number of points to spend. The points act as a rationing device to force your players to form a social contract concerning the types of stories you wish to tell. The book even tells you that this is what the points are for.  I don't see how I could have made it simpler but if you have suggestions I'm here to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also note that a lot of you are mentioning flaws which aren't in the rules, they are in the assumption of how you will use the rules. The two examples I'd note are dispute resolution between players: endless debates between PCs are shortcut by the debate rules, but they were added later, I presume, because people really thought that two players at a table wouldn't waste each other's RL time so much that they needed a dice to tell them which brand of fun to have. The rules that stop you using certamen to bully other players are in a supplement, basically because I presume David didn't envisage players using certamen to bully each other IRL. Ars assumes you are co-operating with the other players even if your characters are not co-operating, and so it lacks mechanics, in the core book, for times when your troupe should just sort itself out in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nArs talks directly about its design intent in some places, and if you ignore that, then the game won't work. You need to co-operate as players although not as characters, or it breaks. If you play it as a game of seeking optimal combinations for highest killing power then, congrats, you win.  Please play something else.  I know that's brutal to people who like that sort of thing, but the Ars covenant design system can't handle you and I say that as the guy who made some of the current version. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in short: <br/>\n* Ars assumes players want to have fun and help other players have fun: it lacks rules, in the core book, to break ties between players.<br/>\n* The setting of Ars is a lot easier to learn than the history of Ebberon.<br/>\n* I'm happy to answer any questions.  I'm happy to be told what I should have done better. I promise to listen in a non-defensive way.<br/>\n* I note that if you have an opinion of what should have been done better, and it is based on a quick read of the old edition, then I probably will not agree if your criticism is valid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150847/#Comment_150847" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T08:16:31+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  8:16AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, reviving an not-quite-a-year-old thread to disagree with and correct other peoples views of a game...<br/>Even more, actually making an account just for that purpose...<br/><br/>Not the best way to start a posting career, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150853/#Comment_150853" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T08:42:16+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  8:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Lord MinxHmmm, reviving an not-quite-a-year-old thread to disagree with and correct other peoples views of a game...<br/>\nEven more, actually making an account just for that purpose...<br/>\n<br/>\nNot the best way to start a posting career, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm fortunate in that I don't have to live up to your opinion of what's good or bad then. 8)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, I joined this forum because I was told it rocked on the site for an AmberMUSH, and I was looking to get my skills together before starting the pbp advertised here: http://shadowsofamber.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=3  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't agree some of the other posters, and I've offered to discuss any issues they have with Ars.

This thread is fine.<br/><br/>I'm new: I don't know your strange customs.  8)<br/><br/>I'd answer with the following points:<br/><br/>* I can see that if you just want the ruleset and to work it up from scratch, then yes, the Houses and Tribunals aren't for you.  You can play without them, and sure, that's creative.  A lot of people do, particularly they play, like Arabic wizards or alternate histories.<br/>* at the same time, I think the setting can help you be creative by taking out some of the scutwork.  You don't want to be bothered building a system of property law for your magicians? Well, we have one.  You don't want to bother building a system for demon design?  Well, we've built you one. I think that helps people.  Now, it wouldn't help you, by the sounds, and that's OK.<br/>* having a rich rather than bare setting allows successive groups of fans to codify their experience and transmit it to the next cohort of fans.  In "Amber" for example, we all groan at "Brand is back" because it was the first advanture ever and the storyline is now obvious and cliche. Similarly, there are certain distinctive stories which every new Ars group goes through, and having that acknowledged and written about lets you mine the insights of previous players and avoid some of their errors.  In "Covenants" for example it talks about not making defensive buys in covenant creation (Don't buy a castle unless you want stories about being under siege, basically) and really thinking about if "Castle in woods near a the faerie forest", which is the typical vanilla setting, is right for you.<br/><br/>So, I can see your point, and I can see that it works for people who have the time and creativity to build from scratch. I don't agree that having extra material limits creativity, although it does lead to more detailled discussions of play contract.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150863/#Comment_150863" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T09:31:46+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  9:31AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with you posting here about Ars Magica or necroing this thread.

Honestly, you can't see the whispers that were going on behind the scenes and the past bullshit that was being acted out here.<br/><br/>I wanted to talk about Ars Magica, the first game I ran for a good, long campaign, for about two years in college and my loves and frustrations with it.<br/><br/>Truth is from reading your post above it sounds like you and I just game differently and that is okay.  We like different things and Ars Magica moved in directions that weren't where my gaming was going.  It isn't about your writing, it is about where people thought the game should go and where I was going.<br/><br/>Ars Magica and me were like former lovers who just found out they wanted different things out of life.  It is just one of those things.<br/><br/>The good news is that I have all of the games on my shelves I could ask for and I'm sure I'll get more.  I have found a niche in this odd little sub-culture.  The other good news is that Ars Magica has a really great fan-base and as you said, the lunatics are running the asylum.  One of said wonderful lunatics, Matt Ryan, is a local here in Ithaca, works at the university where I work and we have lunch every so often and talk gaming.<br/><br/>So, I'm asking that you please not take any of this shit personally, after a while, this thread ceased to honestly even be about Ars Magica at all and I'm sorry that your work got caught up in that total hogwash clusterfuck.<br/><br/>Welcome to Story Games, please don't judge this place but this bullshit thread that went horribly awry.<br/><br/>Sincerely-sincerely,<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150879/#Comment_150879" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T10:52:36+00:00" title="June 15, 2008 10:52AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2008 10:58AM by Timothy.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Hey Timothy, I'm glad you're here.

There are no residuals, so I get a once off payment when each book comes out. Atlas is a relatively generous payer: that is, their rate of pay is a lot higher than for many other freelancing gigs within gaming. <br/><br/>That being said, gaming materials are written for love, not money.<br/><br/>So, Atlas are great guys who pay me before they are required to (the post me a cheque the day of or after release, and they aren't contractually obligated to pay me for some time after release). I haven't had any cash out of them for 6 months just because I wasn't on the team for the last book (Art and Academe).  I hope to get some more money out of them soon because I was on the team for each of the next three books.<br/><br/>I have accidentally got two threads on this now...so if I say stuff in both, please forgive me, but I don't feel I miss that much by being diceless when I play.  I play mostly diced recently, because I want to be up with the game experience from the perspective of a reader, and they deserve that I play their way if I'm going to write useful stuff. I honestly feel that for the way I play, provided I have a batch of players who play the same way, diceless works better for me personally.<br/><br/>Now, I can see that some people like the tension inherent in the large botch pools when they cast magic in auras, and the element of chance is important to some people's enjoyment of certamen.  I can see why they would miss that.  In contrast: I hate it when my magus dies because he has botched a spell in the a major confrontation with an Infernal Lord, because you -know- an infernal lord is going to be camping out in his Infernal Lair with its Infernal aura and I don't like to be killed essentially by my obvious actions igniting the scenery. I found in my own SG games, I'd just fudge player death in these cases, so I decided not to bother...I just made the bad guy a bit tougher and his attacks more deadly-sounding and did away with tension from the botch pool.<br/><br/>I played it diceless mostly because I like the cinematic feel it gives, and because I started playing with ArM2, which was very explicit about the GM having a duty to fudge the stats of the monasters to make each cmobat significant, so if I was fudging the scores to make them fit the dice, I didn't really see the need for the dice, after I started playing a lot of Amber and got hooked on the minimalism of it.<br/><br/>It also meant, in uni, that you could play it on the bus or walking between classes or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150880/#Comment_150880" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T10:55:16+00:00" title="June 15, 2008 10:55AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, the moderator of this forum has stated repeatedly that bringing a thread back from a longtime ago is absolutely fine here.<br/><br/>Let's not put on mod hats on when we aren't moderators.<br/><br/>Thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150886/#Comment_150886" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T11:45:17+00:00" title="June 15, 2008 11:45AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cor, I remember this thread.

I'm a long-time Ars player who discovered as I led a group into 5th Ed. that, like Judd, my tastes and game goals have changed.  I love the setting, but found the system not so much complex on an atomic level, but so dense in practice that to play out of the book required a huge amount of page-flipping by one and all.  I also found the continuous grafting-on of additional magical rules tedious in that it further complicated (and in my opinion detracted from) the elegance of the magic system.  That notwithstanding the coolness of some of the Mystery Cult powers and House Tytalus's Titanoi.<br/><br/>I'm running the saga much more fluidly, using Heroquest (which maps strangely well to the tropes in Ars).  I'd be interested in hearing about your diceless approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153038/#Comment_153038" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T19:25:01+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  7:25PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm moved to post out of nostalgia.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought the old lion rampant version of this game and was very excited about making up multiple characters. I liked making the grog and the companion and the magus and building a story about an isolated community seemed really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no one ever wanted to play that. (Keep in mind that freaking Vampire, by some of the same guys, came out just a few years afterward and... I really... I just... I can't talk about it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, yeah, the latin stuff was neat and I liked the way you could mix and match techniques and whatever the other bits were called.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if I was gonna try to run this game again, I'd take cues from Castle Falkenstein (it's the past, but you can put anything into it you like) and Prime Time Adventures (map out your progress first, then play it out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, having made a similar comment on another thread about a Fantastical Fantasy Brainstorming, which see:<br/>\nhttp://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6701&amp;page=1#Item_11<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it might be nifty to go back to the old spring/summer/winter/fall model for the convinteravivium or whatever the wizard's place is called and have everyone knowing this is about the rise AND FALL of a wizardly experiement. It's going to end in tears, the mages and companions are all going to die and you're just molding the way they do it.

The medieval period is one that a) sucks unless you are rich and in many cases even if you are rich and b) is the story of gradual progress away from this unending suckiness, IMO.  The Order, who are strangely modern because the PCs are strangely modern, creates as series of islands of unsuck in the general realistic medievalness, so that you have this odd thing where high magic is, in a sense, a proxy for modernity. I liked that a lot.  <br/><br/>I didn't quite like the gloominess to cyclical time. Some things don't so much fall as change.  Some things persist.  Some values endure.  I wanted that to be possible, and in Ars it -is-, it's just that this process is called Winter and looks a lot like destruction, but there is always the hope of a new Spring if the players pull that off. I don't think Ars has ever really gripped final Winter properly, because modern players in all genres seem to like stopping their stories at the point where the characters are on a high point.  Historically this was not true: the King Arthur story is "King Arthur's Death". The Beowulf story ends in his death.  Players don't like this, and so Ars has always played with Spring, Summer, Autumn (the fullness of power) and has generally shied away from serious play of final Winter going instead for New Spring.  <br/><br/>So, and I know this sounds weird because I love the game: I don't think the standard materials support what you are trying to do as well as many of the other styles of play.  Back in the WW days they did make a serious stab at this with "A Winter's Tale" and people on the Berklist have reviwed it as basically a great story that they'd never want to force their real life friends to play through.  So, the mechancs are there, but tragic play is not as strongly supported as comic or heroic play.<br/><br/>I asked Robin Laws a question at the con at the weekend about mechnics for failing, because I have been thinking about the Winter problem a lot, and more generally the idea that characters must go from success to success rather than seriously failing, and he gave me a bit of good advice, which was that failure should have some reward that you can use later for success, and I'd suggest that if you did do a version of Ars where you were playing the fall, that you give players some reward at each stage of the process of disintergration. Confidence Points (which in the new edition are basically rerolls) seem like the obvious choice ot me since they have no in-world presence.<br/><br/>Currently the Confidence rule works the other way: you are failing and offer a CNF for a reroll, and lose it if the reroll fails.  I'd go the other way once the season turns in your game so that you suffer a serious blow, and gain a CNF for suffering that blow.

I do mention I play diceless a bit...<br/><br/>There are a few reasons for this, and they are basically:<br/><br/>* I am hired to write books for vanilla play. You have -your- game experience and my game experience doesn't come into it unless I think everyone would benefit, and then I do code my way of play into the rules.  So the "Castles are a flaw not a virtue." thing or the "You can only buy as many story hooks as you will use in six real world months, so you get more in troupes that play weekly than in troupes that play monthly" thing are ways I play that eventually made it into the rules because they make life better for Vanilla players.  For non-Ars players, they solved two of the structural problems of the game (Castles as a point sink was solved by making them have a negative score in the creation rules, and unpaid story flaws were made explicitly illegal).<br/><br/>There are more examples like this in upcoming books, but I can't talk about them because of non-disclosure agreements.  Basically though I don't talk about my way of play unless there is a clear issue to be addressed and I think I have a good fix.<br/><br/>* If I were to write that I do not use rule X, then the author of rule X might, because the net is an odd place, see that as a reflection on the quality of his or her work, and that would not be worth the ill feeling.  Ars is written as a sort of team sport, and for me maintaining the health of that community is vital to the health of the game which I frankly love.  As such, I don't do things that may hurt the other authors, except inadvertently.<br/><br/>[quote]<br/>I'm biased, but it seems to me that<i>that</i>would be the better service.

Although I still respond to every email sent me by anyone about Ars, and I'm still active on the Ars forum, I found that the Berklist is just a painfully bad way to talk about or even think about the game.  It gets so vitriolic and so personal.  I got to the point where I had, once again, been quoting translated bit of medieval French at some guy to show that actually I had reaserched whatever point he was giving me grief about and I thought to myself.  "Um, I only do this as a hobby.  Why am I doing this to myself?"  <br/><br/>And I hadn't thought about it untiul now, but I never really wanted to talk about other ways of play there, because it would have just become another flamewar.<br/><br/>I will need to think about this.  If either of you are on the Ars Forum, where Common Sense and the Banstick reign, we might take it up there...or here if that's OK.  I'm new and so I don't want to hog this space with something that's a bit...well..it's not an indie game, and its not a strongly storyteller based game...so if the Ars Forum would be better maybe we should go over there to talk about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155314/#Comment_155314" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T01:32:19+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  1:32AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2008 1:33AM by Arpie.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't really an indie game forum, according to Clinton and a couple other guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, I'd like to hear about how you play Ars Magica, too, and I really hate what grew out of it (White Wolf and Mage.)<br/>\nSeriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n(It's mostly because of the way they talked on their submissions page.
