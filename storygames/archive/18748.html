While this does give a tangential bond to the other player characters, the important part is defining the bond between the character and The Ship ("the ship is home, the crew is a dysfunctional family"), the reason why they don't just get off at the nearest planet. They do so by picking out of a list of one-line roles, or coming up with their own. In an effort to supply them with as many options as possible, I'd love to hear your ideas. Don't worry about clich\xe9s; as long as they're not too specific, making an oblique reference to characters in existing Space Opera settings is fine.<br/><br/>So. You're on a starship hurtling through space, cooped up in tight, cramped quarters with the same people for days or weeks on end. The air is stale, the water is recycled, the food is tasteless at best, the toilets are constantly clogged. Tell me again why you don't just get off at the next planet and never come back. <b>Why ARE you on this ship, anyway?</b><br/><br/><i>(The list so far)</i><br/>\u2022\t____________ was the original owner of the ship.<br/>\u2022\t____________ put a big down payment towards the ship.<br/>\u2022\t____________ is the forward face of the ship, whether the crew or they themselves like it or not.<br/>\u2022\t____________ keeps us honest.

Seems that those are all mid-story roles. On the one hand, big plus for flavor and immediate conflict/complications. On the other hand, those can all be resolved in some way, thus eliminating them as a reason to continually be on the ship "episode after episode". I had intended the Role on the Ship as the reason your character is part of the family that is the crew (<i>'The ship is home, the crew is a dysfunctional family'</i>). It's an interesting divergence which I hadn't considered, and I'll have to put in a few clarifications in the final explanation of these rules. Good stuff; if not the intended result, it shows the blind spot in the design, which is as good if not better!<br/><br/>Nathan, I'm gonna have to swipe those first three for the final list. Especially "came with the ship" <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>That said, "is a prisoner" kinda removes from the familial attachment that the Role on the Ship is designed for.
