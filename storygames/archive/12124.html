I explained the game and we picked roles.   Nick was the Gun Thief, Matt was the Law, and I was the Jagged Women.<br/>\n<br/>\nNick\u2019s Gun Thief was Diesel, a girl with a trustworthy gun, a polished Camaro, glorious drugs and devil of a blunt instrument.   When she opened the door to her rundown houseboat, she found her former pimp waiting for her, his goon holding a gun to her lover Dinnie\u2019s head.  He demanded the money she left town owing him, Dinnie begged for Diesel to just give them the money, darting frightened glances at its hiding place.  Diesel thinks something doesn\u2019t ring true here, so she tells the pimp he\u2019ll get his money, and a little something extra in the bedroom\u2026 when he follows her in she undresses and when he\u2019s distracted she grabs her shotgun from under the bed and makes her hard decision.  She unloads the gun in the pimp\u2019s face, but doesn\u2019t see the goon taking his gun off Dinnie and leveling it at her.   Dinnie does, though, and steps in front of it to save the woman she loves.  When she dies, Diesel kills the goon and gets out with the drugs and cash and the knowledge that what she thought was a fling was something much, much more to Dinnie.<br/>\n<br/>\nHearing sirens approaching, Diesel grabs a boat from the dock and takes off across the bay.  As the cops close in, she dumps her shotgun and quickly hides the drugs and money.  Unfortunately, she comes across a moaning duffle bag in the back of the boat, which contains a frightened little girl, bound and gagged\u2026 Diesel is ready to make her hard decision.  And she decides to take a gamble and surrender to the cops.  They take her and the girl in, but since she doesn\u2019t own the boat, claims to be a victim running from men with guns, and doesn\u2019t match the description of the girl\u2019s kidnapper, they let her go after 24 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe\u2019s in her Camaro, ready to roll this guy who thinks he\u2019s getting something other than a blunt instrument to the head and his wallet taken for travelling money.  Turns out though, Diesel\u2019s the one who\u2019s getting something unexpected, as she feels the barrel of a pistol in her stomach and the mark tells her he\u2019s here to bring her to Diaz, the pimp\u2019s boss.  The guy makes her get in the front and drive them, all the time talking about how Diesel is the bitch who killed his cousin that one time, and he\u2019s feeling her up and he\u2019s waving his shiny revolver around, and then Diesel makes a hard decision.  She buckles her seat belt and flashes a vicious grin at the guy and floors the accelerator of her beautiful polished Camaro, aiming it at a lamppost.  He ends ups up splattered all over the wall, and she ends up alive with a shiny new revolver.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiesel stumbles away from the wreck, but she barely makes it down the street before she\u2019s snatched by an unknown assailant, and when she comes to, she\u2019s in someone\u2019s basement, tied up to a chair.  In front of her is another, smaller figure, tied up, gagged and tossed in the corner.  As Diesel blinks the bleariness from her eyes, the figure resolves as that same freakin\u2019 little girl from the boat, her big eyes pleading for Diesel to help her.  Diesel struggles against her bonds as she hears footsteps on the stairs.  The man who enters points a gun at the little girl and tells Diesel that she will tell them where the money and the drugs are or he\u2019ll kill the girl.  Diesel replies with an unending stream of profanity, and before he can react, Diesel decides that this is the End.  She throws herself forward, breaking the chair with sheer fury and biting the guy\u2019s cheek off.  As he rolls around in pain, Diesel grabs some chemicals and her lighter and starts the basement burning.  She smashes out the basement\u2019s only window, a tiny thing barely big enough for what she needs.  She unties the girl, helps her out the window and tells her to run.  Then Diesel turns around as the guy gets to his feet, blood pouring down his face.  Grinning, she hefts a piece of splintered chair and gets ready.  The house burns to the ground. There are no survivors.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe End.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here are my comments on the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loved it! I enjoy narrative games, and this is very, very narrative.  I was desperate to be The Law! It looked like it would have been really fun, and very up my alley, framing twists and turns for the Gun Thief, building on former scenes to explore darker and darker consequences, and seeing what kinds of choices the Gun Thief will make when put in hard situations.  Being the Jagged Women was fun, but playing with new people, and not being sure of what they would be comfortable with made it a bit more difficult to really cut loose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some issues.  I don\u2019t think either Nick or Matt got the same thing out of it I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt was brand new to roleplaying, and while I think he enjoyed the narrative freedom he had, he often had trouble getting the hang of scene framing.  He would determine a lot of back story, stating things about Diesel that Nick was uncomfortable with because they didn\u2019t fit his image of the character.  He provided a lot of the \u201creasons\u201d behind things, leaving little room for development.  He definitely had a story in mind, and he was telling it.  We hashed it out with him, and he was cool with working together with us, so there was no animosity involved, but I felt kind of bad basically telling someone he was doing something wrong\u2026  We certainly worked with him, too, but I think unless the game is aimed strictly at the indie game crowd, it could use some more direction for those who don\u2019t have the same knowledge base.  Of course, I could be wrong and maybe the scene framing that the Law engages in is supposed to work that way\u2026 but I\u2019m betting not.  I think Nick felt pretty deprotagonized at one or two points (like the scene that starts off with Diesel taking a plane to Tokyo).  I told Matt to think of scene framing as giving us a movie scene, establishing shot, a little dialogue, but not too much information\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nFor making those hard choices, we found that three choices meant Nick almost always got what he wanted out of the scene.  For next time, we said we\u2019d have to remember to always make sure that there are at least 4 or more things the Gun Thief wants out of each scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really did enjoy it though.  Nick may pop on to express his own opinion, and I welcome any questions or comments y\u2019all have. I gotta warn you, though, that I\u2019m rarely online, so it may be a while before I reply\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nBuddha                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271480/#Comment_271480" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T19:43:01+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  7:43PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buddha</cite>Grinning, she hefts a piece of splintered chair and gets ready.

In the end, she was ready to die before giving them what they wanted. That's some rad stuff, there.

I'm thinking about Don't Rest Your Head in particular. Once the newbie player understood that bizarro stuff was happening all around their character, they started narrating bizarro stuff, and framing bizarro scenes... and I felt like it was my reluctant job to say, "Actually, you don't have those narrative rights. You're encroaching on my territory."<br><br>In Gun Thief, this problem is both minimized and exacerbated. Minimized in that everyone has a specific, unique role. Exacerbated in that it's really easy to get ahead of yourself and encroach on those specific, unique roles.<br><br>Though, at the same time... the rules SPECIFICALLY STATE that The Law can frame the Gun Thief doing things they hadn't previously stated an intention to do. The example in the text is "Okay, so now you're robbing a bank, and..." So, in that regard, Matt wasn't out of line.<br><br>However, when I hear you talk about backstory, that sounds like it has the potential to REALLY step on Diesel's toes. It's Nick's job to define Diesel's past, it's Matt's job to define Diesel's current circumstances. If that makes sense.<br><br>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buddha</cite>I loved it!</blockquote>\nThat's rad! I'm really excited that you enjoyed the game, and that it created the kind of fiction that it purports to. Those twists and hard choices were spot on!<br><br>How long did it take you, from beginning to end?

We actually had time during our 4 hours for Nick to pull out something else to playtest, which took the other three hours!
