I made a little game called School Daze, and I recently had a chance to put it through its paces. It played well, and after some revisions to the draft document, I'm ready to see how it handles in the hands of other groups.<br/><br/>School Daze is a lightweight story game designed to evoke the feel of high school. Each student is driven by their motivations, and works with the Adminstrator to come up with a fun, enjoyable narrative. It has shades of Fiasco in the gameplay, and shades of FATE in the mechanics.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.sandandsteam.net/2012/01/24/school-daze-playtest-1-2/" rel="nofollow">If you want to hear how my session played out and see my design notes, you can do that here</a>.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.sandandsteam.net/2012/01/25/school-daze-open-playtesting/" rel="nofollow">For information about the playest, including the requested feedback and documents, check here</a>.<br/><br/>If you run this with your group, you've got my thanks. I like what I have here so far, and I hope you will, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
