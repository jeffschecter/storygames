I find it quite amazing and flexible. At the same time, the game concepts also remind me of quite a few games I'm aware of.<br/><br/>Most reviews/postings on FU seem to be around 2011. How have things evolved for people? Have people moved to other systems for a rules-light universal game? Are there much better solutions out there that make FU obsolete?<br/>- What is your verdict on FU, in the year 2014 (almost 2015)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440924/#Comment_440924" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-16T00:30:38+00:00" title="December 16, 2014 12:30AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2014 12:34AM by David_Berg.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short version: <br/><br/>I consider FU the best game of its type, but its type is usually not that thrilling to me.<br/><br/><br/>Long version:<br/><br/><b>1. Playing pretend:</b> "My character tries this and fails, does this and succeeds, etc."<br/><b>2. Collaborative roleplaying:</b> "My character tries this -- does it work?"  "I think not."/"Yes!"<br/><b>3. Roleplaying as proto-game:</b> "My character tries this. (Rolls dice.) Looks like it worked!"  "Agreed."<br/><b>3a. Straight success/failure proto-RPG:</b> The die roll tells you only whether you passed a threshold for success in your announced task.<br/><b>3b. Story development proto-RPG:</b> In FU, the die roll answers your intent with a range from Yes, And and Yes, But, to No, And and No, But.  ("F" used to stand for "Free", but I see they've changed it to acknowledge the game's "Freeform" status.)<br/><b>4. Role-playing game:</b> The die roll determines not only what happens for a character, but also how their position changes relative to some sort of feedback and reward systems.<br/><br/>My groups generally opt for option 4 because it's most interesting and provides some social comforts, but occasionally I opt for option 2 because it's simple and to the point.  On the rare occasions when we choose option 3, FU is still the best for that niche.<br/><br/>Note: FU technically has a reward system, but in my eyes, "Reward players for good roleplaying and achieving goals by giving them FU Points," isn't in the same class as profound character changes, victory points, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/roryb" title="roryb"><img alt="roryb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/roryb">roryb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440928/#Comment_440928" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-16T02:20:28+00:00" title="December 16, 2014  2:20AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am still using it as my most frequent go-to game. It certainly fits the bill of, "the regulars aren't here...what can we run with right now?" It's also great for time challenged people who want to get to the meat of the story right quick.<br/><br/>I also discovered that it works pretty well as a play by post game, especially in the hands of the right players. The GM doesn't roll thing and creative players interpreting their own rolls moves the game right along and makes for a fun collaborative result...add that to "dialed out" action, and it can achieve a rare pace in online play.<br/><br/>It's openness is off putting to some, and some qualifying of FU point awards/expenditures helps to reinforce your chosen genre. It doesn't have "character advancement" as was said, but that was never an issue for me.<br/><br/>Nathan was talking about an expanded v. 2 with lots of clarification and cool stuff last spring. I think he's had some hard times at home...I hope all is okay now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440931/#Comment_440931" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-16T10:19:03+00:00" title="December 16, 2014 10:19AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2014 10:19AM by BeePeeGee.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a detailed description, David.
