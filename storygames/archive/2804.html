Here are a couple I know of:<br/><br/>John Wick is designing <b>Houses of the Blooded</b> <a href="http://wickedthought.livejournal.com/tag/houses+of+the+blooded" rel="nofollow">on his LiveJournal</a>. He takes suggestions and publicly makes changes and alterations.<br/><br/>Chad Underkoffler is frequently posting his design steps on <b>Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies</b>, also <a href="http://chadu.livejournal.com/tag/s7s" rel="nofollow">on his livejournal</a>. I think he's more sharing than getting input, when compared to John's process.<br/><br/>I recently opened my <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg5qr5st_3dz2ftb" rel="nofollow">Google Docs draft</a> of <b>Pentripolis</b> to public view. The idea is to give insight into how much things change and get modified before a first draft is even finished (so this is more a collection of notes and ideas at this point). This is more direct for viewing, but much less direct for receiving input and feedback.<br/><br/>Adam Dray, <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/tag/towerlands" rel="nofollow">on his LJ</a>, frequently shares his process on <b>Towerlands</b>.<br/><br/>And, of course, a lot of Game Chef designing happened in public sight, with feedback going back and forth.<br/><br/>The purpose of this thread is twofold: to gather links to games that are currently being designed in public, and to discuss the pros and cons of this approach and its specific incarnations.<br/><br/>One obvious pro is that it creates interest in the game. It also allows the designer to share their excitement about what they're doing.<br/><br/>One obvious con is that you're already putting the game out there. But that's usually not keeping many people from buying it anyway when it comes out. However, sharing something unfinished is kind of like sharing your writing before you've edited it: it takes away some of the mystique of the finished process and it might lower people's view of the quality of your work, if they fail to understand that drafting is a process all written products go through.<br/><br/>Thoughts?

I've been trying to catch up and create buzz about it ever since.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree with your con though - putting the game out there is more likely to do you good, as people who have been following the game's development have a vested interest in the game already, and can help you spread the word. <br/><br/>Obviously as far as the "mystique" goes, I think you have to be careful not to post a load of crap that's not ready to be seen by human eyes, but equally do people really want mystique in their games? I know I'm far more likely to go for a game I've followed in development for a long time (Reign, I'm looking at you) and been involved with in some way than a game that is more mysterious that I know little about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63650/#Comment_63650" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T09:42:40+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  9:42AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been designing my support group horror game, <strong>Damned Anonymous</strong> openly on my design blog, <a href="http://www.hmfy.com/masterplan/" rel="nofollow">Master Plan</a>.

Interestingly enough, I don't think that the fear is all that grounded in reality. <br/><br/>For the 'not buy the game at all' concern the 'open source' method of development doesn't seem to have hurt the sales of the guys that have done it (D20, Fate/SoTC, just to name two off the top of my head)... although I would be interested to hear the stories and opinions of anyone who has first hand experience selling an 'open sourced' project on the matter.<br/><br/>The 'steal your idea' bit is a little bit trickier. At the end of the day though, my experience is that we are all 'borrowing' ideas from other games/settings/mediums anyway... and then doing what we can to improve to or add to that idea. So unless they are directly ripping you off (in way that would be litigatable) I think that a little 'sharing' doesn't hurt sales either.<br/><br/>In terms of mystique... I expect that the people who are looking for a wholly finished, complete game are probably not the ones who are going to be following a design journal. On the other hand, those that are fans of the author or fans of the product will get psyched with every bit of new information (in some ways, I would argue, actually creating some mystique when they 'sell' the game to others: "Man, did you hear that REIGN is going to have rules for..." etc).<br/><br/>Just my .02                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63660/#Comment_63660" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T09:53:52+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  9:53AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, yes, that's a risk.

I think he's more sharing than getting input, when compared to John's process.</blockquote>\nI would agree. I tend to get my input on gamestuff from (in rough order): <br/>* Initial peer reviewers<br/>* primary playtesters<br/>* secondary, blind playtesters<br/>* production team<br/>* general peer review<br/><br/>In the past, this has been behind closed doors. For the present experiment, most of the nitty-gritty system stuff will be behind closed doors until after the primary playtests are underway. "Commentable material" (as it were) will start showing up possibly before or concurrent with starting the secondary playtests.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>One obvious pro is that it creates interest in the game. It also allows the designer to share their excitement about what they're doing.<br/><br/>One obvious con is that you're already putting the game out there. But that's usually not keeping many people from buying it anyway when it comes out. However, sharing something unfinished is kind of like sharing your writing before you've edited it: it takes away some of the mystique of the finished process and it might lower people's view of the quality of your work, if they fail to understand that drafting is a process all written products go through.</blockquote>\nI agree with both of these things.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63680/#Comment_63680" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T11:23:36+00:00" title="April 12, 2007 11:23AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Because the participation of others necessarily ruins important processes.

Statistically, chances are they're right - most games never get finished - and you'll look like... what was it again? A cheeseball?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Pros:</b><br/>\n- You create some buzz.<br/>\n- You can track your progress. ("Shit! Haven't posted anything in a month! Time to do some work!")

Sometimes, no one cares and there's not a lot you can do about that, but I think some of the fault lies with the poster. Here is some advice gleaned from my own mistakes.<br/><br/><i>I am breaking most of these "rules" right now in my <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">own blog</a>! Gah! That will change after today.</i><br/><hr/><br/><br/>In general, most of my advice regards writing clearly, using the blog medium to its maximum potential, and changing your style so your blog is a two-way communication and not a one-way infodump. Here are some specific suggestions that might help. <b>If you have others, I'd love to hear them!</b><br/><br/><b>Repeat Context</b><br/><br/>Every time you post about your game, assume the reader is new. If they've been following along since the beginning, they'll skip that quick intro paragraph. More likely, lots of your blog readers skim your stuff. When you say something that finally grabs their attention, don't expect them to go reading back through your entire blog to get caught up. Make it easy for people to comment by providing the necessary context they need to engage in discussion with you. If you refer to prior posts or build upon them, summarize the content so they don't really have to read it unless they want the details. Link to those posts you reference.<br/><br/><b>Link to the Game</b><br/><br/>Every time you post about your game, link to it. If you don't have a work product to link, make something simple. Create a single blog post that summarizes your game with your "elevator speech" or your Three Questions or whatever. Link to that. Basically, you want a single place to which you can consistently link to provide a reader with the basics about your game and answers to frequently asked questions.<br/><br/><b>Ask Questions</b><br/><br/>If you talk about your game but never ask questions, people aren't likely to "answer." Even if your question is, "Does this sound cool?" or "Who would play this?" you should ask it. Make your questions stand out by putting them in their own paragraph or bolding them or something.<br/><br/><b>Be Controversial</b><br/><br/>Don't be controversial just to be annoying or contrary, but if you know you're saying something people might not agree with, go for the gusto. Don't be afraid to annoy people. If you're talking about something that people have strong opinions about, take a stance and watch people come out of the woodwork to disagree with you. Disagreement = discussion. Piss people off once in a while!<br/><br/><b>Avoid Cuts</b><br/><br/>LiveJournal and WordPress have the ability to "cut" -- that is, you can have a "leader" to your post and require the reader to click the "more" link to read the rest of it. I cut as little as possible because I want to make it easy for people to read my stuff. If I post something reaaaaaaally long, I might cut a chunk of it, but I am careful to leave enough in the leader to cue the reader about what exactly I am saying and pique their interest. Hopefully, anyway.<br/><br/><b>Format Neatly</b><br/><br/>Assuming you have something of substance to say, you want to encourage people to read it. Providing bolded headers, small coherent paragraphs, and bullet lists will make your text easier to read. Skimmers will be more likely to get the gist of what you're saying and get sucked in and really read it. <br/><br/>Think about it:<ul><li>If I had written this post in one giant paragraph with no headers, you might have just skipped it. Maybe you saw a header that interested you, or maybe you inadvertently skimmed a short paragraph and it caught your eye, leading you to read it all from the beginning...</li></ul>\n<b>Summarize</b><br/><br/>Don't forget all the rules you were taught in expository writing class. I can't remember where I learned this but, "Tell them what you're going to tell them. Tell them. Then tell them what you told them." Basically, you want to make sure people understand you, and redundancy helps get the point across. <i>Redundancy is a part of clear writing.</i><br/><br/>So, essentially, there's a lot you can do to encourage readers to participate in your design blog.<ul>\n<li>Remember all your rules from English class and add in what you know about the power of layout and graphic design. <br/></li><li>Know your audience and don't assume they know anything. <br/></li><li>Write clearly. <br/></li><li>Summarize your points.<br/></li><li>Don't be afraid to repeat yourself for clarity. <br/></li><li>Use white space, headers, bullets, and formatting to make your points stand out. <br/></li><li>Make it easy for your readers to read your work by avoiding needless "cuts."<br/></li><li>Make each post independent of what came before. <br/></li><li>Be a little controversial and have something to say, preferably something <i>different</i> to say. <br/></li><li>Link to a game page and a FAQ (make one if you have to). <br/></li><li>Ask questions to spur and guide discussion.</li></ul>\nSo, does this help?

(Like my tortured, run-on sentences.  And sentence fragments.)  That also follows the "squeaky wheel" rule, meaning if I have someone who says, "I HATE psychic battles from pirate ship to pirate ship," and is convincingly vehement, I may be taking out a whole element of AWESOME that would have really placed my work on the "Must Read!" pile for more people.  <br/><br/>[Which makes it sound a little like a popularity exercise, which, well, in fact, it might be.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65570/#Comment_65570" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T14:37:34+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  2:37PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's one of the things about feedback that we need to consider: whether it's something that's really somewhat broken or incoherent in your design, or just a preference.<br/><br/>I mean, if that same person said, "your design goal was to have swashbuckling pirate fights, but with these psychic rules in place no one's going to want to be a non-psychic pirate" or "fights will always be over before the ships meet," that'd be something worth considering.<br/><br/>But yes--having a small group of feedback people necessarily will impact the kind of feedback you get.

That way if everyone says "I hate the psychic pirate rules!" you can be fairly sure there's something wrong and it's not just preference, whereas if just the one person has a problem with it, it might well be a preference and not a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Designing in

Did it achieve your intentions and generate a fan base?<br/> <br/>I know it worked on me at least - I remember following your columns avidly, before I'd even thought about designing my own game, and bought Underworld when it first came out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66127/#Comment_66127" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T08:31:53+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  8:31AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also a support network, Gareth. <br/><br/>(Do you go by Gareth, or Gareth-Michael, or GM, or something else?)<br/><br/>Sure, the dark side of that is mindless ego-stroking. The bright side of it, though, is encouragement when energy and confidence are flagging. I think that the encouragement to complete a game is important. I would hope the people who root for me to finish my games will root for me to playtest them and improve them, too. I also hope they'll tell me when something isn't working.<br/><br/>Design can be such a lonely activity and community makes it more fun. I get to cross-pollinate my ideas with others'. I get to bounce ideas off people and see what works and what doesn't. <br/><br/>It may be that you didn't see those benefits because you weren't looking for them (or didn't need them). As you said, your goal in designing in public was advertising. You most likely angled your posts towards marketing, not community support. I can't see that writing ad-copy week after week for your readers could generate much more than the kind of ego-stroking that you mention -- and sales, hopefully.<br/><br/>So, pointless? I think not. <br/><br/>Navel-gazing? Perhaps, in that it takes a certain amount of madness to write a role-playing game these days, and a certain amount of wondering aloud seems to help me and others stay sane. <br/><br/>Inbred-community-ego-stroking? I don't think so. I get only a little praise for the stuff I post. I get a certain amount of criticism; more if I post my designs on The Forge or Story Games.

We blew through the first (and only) print run fairly quickly.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely convinced that it would work now, though -- at the time, it was a fairly unique draw.  I was doing it, and Wick started his ORKWORLD public design a few weeks later, and that was pretty much the extent of it.   Now, though, I think that any public-design effort would be seen as just another in an overcrowded field.

I'm sorry, but the entire hobby was founded over 30 years ago by designers releasing their creator-owned projects.   Participation at The Forge and Story Games, even without praise, has a tendency to reinforce the false belief in the 'specialness' of the non-existant category of "indie."   <i>That</i> is the ego-stroke, and one which is pervasive, whether served with the additional "Cult of Ron" flavoring that you get at the Forge, or the "Cult-less" variety that you get here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66385/#Comment_66385" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T12:40:29+00:00" title="May  1, 2007 12:40PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Indie" isn't a category?

I smell straw and smoke.<br/><br/>Let's say I accept your idea that there's a widespread belief in the "specialness" of indie publishing. <br/>Let's say I accept your idea that there's some kind of pervasive ego-stroking in the public design that occurs on Story Games and The Forge.<br/><br/>What's your point?

I'd like to add a few of my own:<br/><br/><b>Keep a scrapbook</b><br/>I've been posting whenever I come across some cool visuals that help communicate the atmosphere of Do. Movie trailers, anime stills, quilts, and illustrations. I noticed John Wick <a href="http://wickedthought.livejournal.com/658986.html?nc=6" rel="nofollow">did something similar</a>, posting a youtube video of a guitarist playing in an unusual style as an example of the music one might hear in the world of Houses of the Blooded. I find that it's useful just for my own reference when I'm trying to grasp the more ephemeral attributes of a game's setting and makes for a reasonable substitute for promo art in the very early stages of a game's development.<br/><br/><b>Cite your Sources</b><br/>If you've suddenly been inspired by a bit of a podcast, a magazine article, a movie or song, provide a link to that material so readers can share the experience a bit. Again, I do this for my own benefit when I need to research my source material again.<br/><br/><b>Tags and Icons</b><br/>When you're working on multiple projects, or your blog serves a dual purpose as a design journal and personal journal, tags can be a real lifesaver. When you post a link to your blog, you can just link to the specific tag's entries so new readers don't have to skim through your unrelated material. Similarly, if your blog allows you to use a custom icon for each entry, create an icon for your game and use that in every related post. It helps people spot relevant writings more easily as they're browsing through their friends list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76853/#Comment_76853" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T17:52:22+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  5:52PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Daniel:</p>\n<p>To go along with your scrapbook idea... check out <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/" rel="nofollow">TiddlyWiki</a>.

I could think of two or three things this pop-up could be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you click a link to open it, there's an animation that looks a lot like a pop-up. However, what is happening is the Javascript is revealing text that is hidden on the page... so when the animation is done, there is no pop-up, just a new paragraph of content on the page.</li>\n<li>Links have tooltips that pop up when you hover over them. You may be seeing the tooltip briefly before the link you clicked opens. Try hovering without clicking to see what this looks like.</li>\n<li>Likewise, when you hover over a tiddler, a small toolbar appears in the upper right of the tiddler... in some versions. On mine, it's there to begin with, but a very light grey; hovering over the tiddler makes it more visible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, you should try the page in Safari to see if it looks different.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Best way to demonstrate what it's supposed to look like: in the right-hand sidebar, click "close all". You should have a blank area between the sidebars. In the left-hand sidebar, click HelloThere. A paragraph should appear in the middle.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76965/#Comment_76965" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T14:28:48+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  2:28PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm new to the whole "design in public" idea; for the most part I really haven't done it, though I sometimes will think out loud in my blog. I decided to try a more public approach with my new game idea, so I came here, and it was fantastic; in a few days I had gotten a lot of ideas and suggestions that really helped me solidify the concept of my game. Then Ryan invited me to join <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Master Mines</a>, and that has also been a huge help.<br/><br/>I don't know what level of transparency I will keep with my current design, to be honest. I am very much a student of Gareth in the sense that I see Design Journals as part of a marketing campaign, but I also am enjoying the aspect of throwing something out there and seeing what feedback it generates. In Master Mines this is very focused, but even on my blog it has worked somewhat. Let's say that I have found it interesting and useful enough to continue doing it on a regular basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76990/#Comment_76990" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T16:02:56+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  4:02PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Master Mines, at least from my vantage point, isn't about designing in public for the sake of marketing or whatnot.  I think our blogs are probably more effective.<br/><br/>Master Mines is able declaring your bold intent to the world, and working to make it happen.  When you design in public, with a support network around you, you've got to put up or shut up.  If that's what it takes to get you through the hard times, freakin' awesome.<br/><br/>I post up ideas on my blog.  Most folks don't respond, but it's out there because I wanted to post an idea.  I post up ideas on Master Mines in order to test them in the fires of honest criticism &amp; feedback.  My point is that there's more than one thing you can get out of open design, and you aren't always getting the same thing depending on how you do that open design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76998/#Comment_76998" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-21T16:47:45+00:00" title="June 21, 2007  4:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>That's probably why this latest version (which I didn't know about until yesterday) is working to add the ability to split the wiki into several subwikis.</blockquote> Ooh.
