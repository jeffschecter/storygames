It was simple and fun, but I had to use a set of two fan-rules to make the game run faster: I can't find them on a simple search, but they were basically to allow you to do an attack in order to lower your enemy's defense for the *next* attack. Which is great in games where two high-powered fighters go head to head, where they can't hit/damage each other but once in 256 tries. Unless you were playing Dragon Ball, in which case that would be "Genre Emulation", but still.<br/><br/>Anyway, my favorite incarnation is BESM 2nd, but without using skills. Skills added too much complication. If anything, I'd only allow the players to each have two skills, tops.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: Here's a fan sourcebook: <a href="http://www.neko-machi.com/arpg/besm/besm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.neko-machi.com/arpg/besm/besm.html</a><br/>EDiT 2: Oh crap, heh it's Ewen's.
