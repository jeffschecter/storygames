I'm planning to use this captive audience to try out a game I've wanted to play for quite a while, <i>Geiger Counter</i>.  (With any luck, a table full of cartoonists ought to at least produce an interesting map.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, can anyone offer any advice?  We've got six potential players--including myself and my wife--and I'm a little concerned a group that large might be problematic.  Only about half the group has much RPG experience, but I don't think that's much of a negative for <i>Geiger Counter</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat material needs should I prepare for?  What size paper have people found best for maps?  How many dice am I likely to need for a group this size?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've prepared a few things already, designing a new character sheet and assembling a pile of actor photos we can stick on them to cast our movie.  And I made a simple little <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Geiger_Counter_plot_seeds" rel="nofollow">inspiration aid</a> over at Abulafia to help us come up with a plot, if necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'm going to broadcast the thing on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ustream.tv/" rel="nofollow">Ustream</a>, as long as none of the players object, as one friend who won't be there expressed some interest in that.  I may also tap my soundtrack collection for mood music, as long as that doesn't stomp all over my Ustream audio or force me to play DJ all night.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, am I making any terrible mistakes, yet?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266657/#Comment_266657" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T11:03:51+00:00" title="April 12, 2010 11:03AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far no mistakes that I can see.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Sheridan</cite>We've got six potential players--including myself and my wife--and I'm a little concerned a group that large might be problematic.</blockquote>\nGC is one of those games in which the more, the better. In fact it could work very well even with 8 players. As long as everyone is on board with the "you might easily loose your character during play, yet continue playing", you'd have no problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266768/#Comment_266768" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:57:16+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:57PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 3:57PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Matt.  If I didn't have grad school classes and work this week I would totally crank out the other half of the (unfinished) third draft of Geiger Counter, just so you could play the best possible version with these folks.  Thanks for organizing this.  I am gonna be stoked to see what you come up with.<br><br>A few initial thoughts:<br><br>- 6 players is fine, though probably near the max for Geiger.  I disagree with Tristan that more is better, especially if you're aiming more for Alien rather than Anaconda.<br><br>- I typically just use 6 sheets of standard printer paper taped into a giant rectangle, but if you want to use something else, go right ahead. A sheet of posterboard should be plenty big.  It's sometimes helpful, beforehand you start drawing, to discuss whether a top-down or horizontal view map is best for your premise.  Like, if you're spelunking in The Descent or climbing in Vertical Limit, you probably want to view things from the side.<br><br>- In the current (beta) draft, each player comes up with their own character concept.  Don't do this.  Instead, have everybody brainstorm a dozen concepts together, more concepts than there are players, and then apportion out the concepts to the players, who pick one to be a main character while the rest become secondary characters.<br><br>- Honestly, more and more, I suggest coming to the table with a very general concept pre-decided.  Like: we're gonna do a zombie movie.  Or, we're gonna have people attached by some strange alien force that makes them go crazy.  And then the group can expand or even subvert that concept in their brainstorming.  This avoids that thing that sometimes happens in PTA where you sit about for 30 minutes before really digging into the game.  Like, maybe they'll decide they want zombies that come out of the water as the ocean spits up its dead (happened in a bunch of zombie games I've played, strangely enough), but not that they hate zombies and want man-eating lions like The Ghost And The Darkness.<br/><br/>If you want, I can probably write up a one-page summary of how I would present the rules (which I should do for the next draft anyway), but I don't want to throw a wrench in the prep you've aready done, which sounds terrific.  Just let me know how I can be helpful.<br/><br/>P.S. Yes, the game clearly needs new character sheets.  I'd also love to see what you're coming up with in this regard.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266770/#Comment_266770" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T16:03:10+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  4:03PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 4:05PM by sage.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My one piece of advice/warning: in my experience, the first time a group sits down to play Geiger, particularly if they're already friendly, it can veer more horror-comedy than straight horror.

That's cool; more collaborative stuff is always welcome.  So how far does this collaborative phase go?  Just character concepts, or should it go all the way through goal, survival dice, and advantage dice?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

But I'm really looking forward to hearing what the group comes up with, premise-wise.  Maybe I can get away with just saying our movie is an '80s / early '90s-style, direct-to-video, sci-fi-monster-kills-people-in-an-isolated-place flick, and let the group decide what the isolated place is and what the monster is like.  (Hmm, and nailing down the basic cinematic style beforehand would let me choose the soundtrack now, instead of having to find appropriate material on the fly...) \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.
