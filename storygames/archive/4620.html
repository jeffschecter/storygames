So about a month ago my bi-weekly group (me, Quintin Stone, Travis and Matthew Gandy) finished up our With Great Power game. We used the WGP rules to run a game set loosely in the setting of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Watch_%28Russian_novel%29" rel="nofollow">Night Watch</a> (the series of Russian books, and when you squint enough, a movie or two), but set in America's Seattle instead of Russia.<br/><br/>The game ran, I dunno, about 7-8 sessions total over about 3 months or so. It was a blast. Probably one of the coolest gaming experiences ever.<br/><br/>Anyway, James was asking me to break it down as he had some questions. I rarely post Actual Play unless something didn't go right, or I need help with something (just no time these days), but James had some questions and I wanted to throw down some answers.<br/><br/>First off, the background:<br/>* Matthew (also a WGP fan) was a little trepidatious, as WGP conflicts need to spring from talking to flying to punching through walls and stuff. So I determined to turn up the juice: Make the game more loosely set in the Night Watch series, in a way where the heroes (if they took those powers in their Schtickball) could use Occult Powerz to fly, punch through walls, throw busses, or drift back and forth to talking.<br/>* I (the GM) was the only person in my group who had never been to Seattle. I printed out one Wikipedia page and 3 google maps-maps for my reference. There were lots of Starbucks jokes.<br/>* I (the GM) was the only person who had read any of the Night Watch books. Only one other had seen the first movie. Turns out that this wasn't an issue, as I wasn't sticking super-close to cannon, plus the players HAD read the Dresden Files books, which between that and enough episodes of Angel, "you kinda get the picture". But every now and then I would, when characters were doing something, spin off the equivalent of a paragraph in a "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" voice, as if narrating to them the rules of the world. "As you are well aware, all Others have the ability to see into or travel into the Gloom. The Gloom has many levels, and it sucks your energy, but with practice you can spot Others, travel through the first level of the Gloom, etc". Basically encyclopedic moments where I was sure to jump in only before the characters did stuff, and not jump in in a way that was like, "You can't do that because shit doesn't work like that in the books". It worked out well, but the players were totally on board.<br/>* The first session I drew up a relationship map that featured all the major players: The Night Watch, the Day Watch, and other Others in the city, as well as background characters and non-Others. We referenced this All The Time. At the beginning, I had a few ideas for powers and personalities, but I mostly just wrote down a bunch of names, and as the time felt appropriate I just pulled them into the scene.<br/>* The characters were:<br/>Natasha Tremson - A Greek Muse, alive for thousands of years. Did something "bad" recently (in the past few hundred years), totally not set during character generation, which would later come up and be the focal point for that character. Has a poet/post-grad boyfriend. Powers are "Inspire People/Change People".<br/>Thomas Kessler - An everyman Other light mage. He comes from a long line of known, respected, powerful mages. Nobody knows that his magic is a sham, he has no innate magic and he relies on trinkets constantly. His father went missing when he was young, and soon materials surface regarding the last actions/acts of his father. His best friend lives next door and doesn't know his secret.<br/>Frank Collins - Internet Startup Millionaire who just broke up with his girlfriend. He was in the middle of jumping off a bridge to end it all when he developed water magic powers and became an Other. Can control water in all forms, quite powerfully so. Trying to deal with the breakup and come to terms with his powers.<br/>* Secrets!  Yeah, bitches!  I was a GM and I had <b>GM secrets</b> about the enemies and their plans!  When the characters won a conflict I read off the aspect titles ("The Plan", etc) and let them knock them down, but the plans and the identities of the baddies did not get revealed until later in the game. It totally worked, too. Also, I kept the plans not set in stone, because over the course of the game one plan looked lame, and because of player input (through play of the game), I was able to change the plan to better fit where the players were going. So it was like a cross between "GM Secrets" and "Mike Holmes' game where all the players create the plot as they go along without realizing it".<br/>* We ran a full arc: 5 point spread.  The players decided to hit <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> twice to steal two decks before moving on to fill in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>.<br/>* Lots of times we would have a scene without a clear idea of if it was to be a Conflict Scene or an Enrichment Scene. In fact, there were a lot of no-conflict "Exposition Scenes" (not in the rules). They helped fill in the game and make the world more cohesive, and were awesome.<br/><br/>So, with that in mind, some of the questions I was asked:<br/><br/>[continued in next post]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104441/#Comment_104441" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T18:59:04+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  6:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>*(In general what does WGP look like when run over long periods), as most of the AP I've read was focused in the "annual" style of play - was it enjoyable? were there frustrations?</b><br/><br/>The only frustration was that I was intending for it to be a four-session game, but it ended up going way over. We figured that "5 spaces in the story arc means about 5 sessions, maybe 4". Turns out that a lot of story happened between those conflicts. And even at the end, as a GM I made the conflicts important for the players (or tried to) so that a few times even though it would have advanced the plot and made them more powerful, the players chose to go for the Win rather go for the Lose (and advancement).<br/><br/>It was wholly enjoyable. I think the bits that ended up being most enjoyable were letting the players take on the roles of background NPCS, including major NPCs.  Like the boss of their organization: When the players first met him, a tall dark man named Mark Murdock (aka Mukhamuud) an ancient Egyptian mage-engineer, now a business-suit wearing negotiator), I handed him over to Mattew. "Mark is nice. He exhudes power, but also charm. He takes people under his wing. Go." I did this a lot. It was advice given in the book, and it made the game so much more than what I expected.<br/><br/>Frustrations came with the rules: We got the flow of combat and all, but almost every single conflict we had to stop, and go, "Wait, how many cards do we all get again? Discard down to what?" etc. The card rules seem a little wonkier than they need to be. If I ran it again, I'd make a cheat sheet with those rules in an easy-to-find way.<br/>Also, aside from one conflict, all multiple character conflicts against one foe were "Use one conflict track: Anyone can participate" instead of "Use three conflict tracks at once". Using multiple conflict tracks against one opponent would have, IMO, broken the game up silly: Character one is talking, character two is shooting water blasts, character three is cooking dinner, etc. But it worked well.<br/><br/><b>* did you find it repetitive to keep zapping people's strife aspects in different ways over the course of a long game?</b><br/><br/>Not really at all. It was very natural. I even Devastated Frank Collins' supremely powerful Water Mage Powers. Each conflict I zapped him in, we described the powers as losing more control, or a conspiracy coming to light where the baddies were to take control of them, etc. In one quick 1-2 session game I can see how it might look strange, but over the long game it was totally natural. In fact, the ways that the strife aspects were "zapped" developed naturally in the narration at the end of conflict. We didn't even have to spell it out.<br/><br/><b>* When I played WGP briefly, I felt kind of cheated by the way the system helped me win at the end. One of the things I love about superhero stories is that, at the end, the hero triumphs against overwhelming odds through cunning and luck: as a reader, it makes ME feel resourceful and cunning. (I guess this is gamist.) But with WGP's pacing mechanic, I felt like I was just getting swept along with a mechanical effect. Did you guys have this effect?</b><br/><br/>Yes and No. We were aware of it, but we tightly embraced it. We looked at it more like a Power Gauge in a 2D fighting game: Every punch to the face increases the bar a little, until eventually we flip out and do a Shadow Ha-ryu-ken or something. In the end, resourcefulness or cunning aside, in most all supers games the characters are <b>meant to win</b>. In every supers game that I played in, the GM would always (self included) make sure that the final boss, while tough, could be overcome. If he was kicking ass, then we would start fudging rolls to give the players a chance, etc. This game just makes that transparent.<br/><br/>Also, note that the track says that at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> the characters CAN defeat the enemies: It might be the case that they do not! I would find it hard to imagine, but if a GM plays really hard, and the players opt not to steal decks from the GM, I could totally see a game where the characters get to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> and still get all their Strife Aspects devastated (and thus "The Bad Guys Win"). We got 1/3 to 1/2 of the way there in our game: One Devastated, two Close to Devastated.<br/><br/>The one thing that I imagine would happen was this: When we get closer to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a> (the final mark) in the story arc track, that players would intentionally fail conflicts, no matter what was at stake, in order to get the jump on that track so that they could finally take down the bad guy. This, surprisingly, didn't happen. I set up two conflicts fully intending the players to fold so that they could advance the plot. Turns out that they players thought it would be cooler to win those conflicts (or more important to their characters to win those conflicts) so they hammered at me and won, even though it meant that the game went another session or two instead of jumping right to that endgame area.<br/><br/><b>* Did you use the pundit's letter/fan column stuff at the end? What was it like? Did it provide a satisfying Narrativist-ical ending?</b><br/><br/>Heh. We didn't do a pundit/letter column, though I did ask the players to write an epilogue about their characters via email. The ending was really cool, if I do say so myself. The only problem was that we all forsaw the game ending, finally, in that seventh (or so) session... because of awesome roleplaying and stuff, it drug out a bit. We normally wrap up at 10-10:30PM, but that night, to get it over with and close the book, we played until 12:00. Which worked out well, but I think that because of it we really missed a chance to sit down and slowly think about what a good epilogue would have looked like. But we ended up doing that over email, so it worked out.<br/><br/>Off to the side: Frank the dot-com millionaire saved the day, got his girl back (somewhat) and dedicated himself hardcore to his new Night Watch duties.<br/>Thomas solved the mystery of his father, destroyed his necromancer grandfather (one of the two baddies), and ended up developing his own inner magic to the point that he never needed to rely on trinkets again.<br/>Natasha overcame the details of her past (an uprising in Tibet in the 70s), kept the team together and thwarted the other baddie who was planning on destroying Seattle in order to save it (by using a traumatic disaster to create more Others).<br/>The last scene had them going to Annie Starr's, a wharfside diner, for pie with a few other Dark and Light Other friends. This was a return to the first thing they did in the first scene of the first session of the game ("Conflict: Is the Pie delicious? Oh, yes it is").<br/><br/>DAMMIT!!! I just realized that it would have been so awesome if I had bought a real pie to eat for that last session. Oh well. I'm writing that down in the notebook, though.<br/><br/>[continued]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104442/#Comment_104442" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T18:59:10+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  6:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>* How did you guys go about setting up a Struggle? Did you make up heroes and villains specificially for the Struggle, or re-use characters you were already familiar with?</b><br/><br/>We kind of brainstormed a Struggle. Turns out that, while it framed the characters awesomely, it wasn't a major theme running through the game. It was a great framework that really tied everything together, but once we had it in place and "poured the foundation" as it were, we didn't return to it.<br/><br/>The villains I wrote up specifically with the PCs in mind, still thinking a little about the struggle, but focusing more on how to make use of those juicy Strife Aspects. <br/><br/><b>* Did you use any "supervillain teams"? How do they work under the rules?</b><br/><br/>Yeah: At first, to make the characters each shine, I wanted one villain for each character. Before the first game session, I realized that that would have made the game a LOT longer. So I took one of the villains :: a good guy, actually, just on one of the PCs cases. Basically, in the Night Watch series there is The Inquisition, basically an Internal Affairs unit. And one Light Other Inquisition guy got word of Natasha's uprising in the 70s and was set to investigate and possibly book her ("book her" == "freeze her into rock for a few generations") :: and rolled him up under one of the other villians as an unknowing henchman. In other words, Thomas' necromancer Grandfather was feeding information anonymously to the Inquisition to keep Natasha busy so that she couldn't interfere with his plans for her partner Thomas. Make sense?<br/><br/>That's a lot of stuff. But if anyone had any questions as to how the game ran, or specific questions about the game (I still have all the sheets and R-Map. I might have them bronzed), feel free to ask!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104566/#Comment_104566" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T08:27:18+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  8:27AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the write-up, Andy!<br/><br/>One thing that I think is worth noting: from what I recall, we kind of finagled some of the conflict rules.

Andy (or anyone), correct me if I'm wrong here.<br/><br/>We eventually ended up ignoring that because I think we felt it was too... constraining?  We did a lot of finely granulated back-and-forths in our conflict narrations so we wanted to play a lot of cards.

I think you can switch back using some low cards, you'll fail, but maybe you have an ace up your sleeve for the next action (I could be wrong here, but since you play two cards and discard the high to switch, I don't see how it really works the other way). But even then, you'll lose options.  I think that's a great part of the flow of losing the battle.  As you get pounded and more harried your options shrink.<br/><br/>"A few sessions"?  Well the suits should reset after every conflict.  Did you have these persist across the whole game? I could definitely see why there was a problem if they persisted across multiple conflicts.<br/><br/>I think that's why multiple tracks are important. It divides the GMs decks and hand, making the GM less dominating. Plus, if another player plays diamonds for talking and you wanted to talk with a bunch of your hearts, then you get screwed by your own teammates.  I think multi-track is the way to go.

I think your game lasted 4 hours because you did the tweaked/sped up version of narration/getting into the game.  <br/><br/>Thing is, as I've seen in con games: You can create a character with three aspects, declare one the strife aspect, and do nothing more than peg that one in conflicts: That's the one that the villain wants (usually), that's the one that the player uses to plow through most conflicts, etc.  In our game, the characters had about 5, and instead of constantly zapping the strife over and over, they played up other aspects, going for enrichment scenes with them. <br/><br/>For example, one of the aspects on Quintin's (above) character's sheet of Thomas Kessler the Widget Mage was that he had "My best friend X" (forgot his name now, sorry) who lived next door and didn't know his secret.  We had at least 2 enrichment scenes with that character and 1-2 exposition (conflict-less) scenes with him, too. In fact, one of the most memorable roleplaying moments of the campaign, IMO, was an enrichment scene that involved Thomas going next door at like 2AM, seeing his buddy in his shed tinkering with RC cars, and then racing them around the track while they talked about life, stressors, and (IIRC) Thomas revealed his secret to his best friend (the best friend was played by Travis, another player: As GM, all I did was sit back and watch. It was marvelous). If we had a high-impact "now Now NOW!" game, we could have totally skipped any scene with the friend, we could have totally ditched most of the plot and scenes of Frank and his ex-girlfriend (or the dating scene between Frank and a hottie Day Watch (though well meaning) receptionist succubus), and we could have had Natasha not have side scenes where she used and abused her Night Watch Other peers (she let her powers get the better of her).<br/><br/>But holy crap, the game was all the more memorable IMO because we stopped along the way for those scenes, for the other non-Strife aspects on the sheets. They really gave the characters and the game overall more depth.<br/><br/>I could totally run the same setup for a con, and probably vault through it like a whirlwind in one 4-hour shot. But it would be like watching a Miniseries in fast-forward.  Back in the day, my mom loved the drama "James Clavel's(sp?) SHOGUN" (actually, so do I, it's awesome). At one point, FOX or someone showed the entire drama (12-18 hours)... in 2 hours. With commercials. I imagine that this game would have looked like that if pushed into one session, or sped up the conflicts. Maybe not THAT ridiculous (it was pretty ridiculous. 2 hours with CMs???), but still, almost uncomfortably "sped up".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>I think that's why multiple tracks are important. It divides the GMs decks and hand, making the GM less dominating. Plus, if another player plays diamonds for talking and you wanted to talk with a bunch of your hearts, then you get screwed by your own teammates.  I think multi-track is the way to go.  But outside of suits closing down options, what was your experience outside of the suits for using a single track?  Did you notice either of these problems or were they non-issues?</blockquote>\nI totally hear that. In a conflict where I had two GM NPCs fighting the players, I used two tracks, each for "everybody vs NPC 1", "everybody vs NPC 2".  But otherwise, what I was kinda avoiding was a case of "PC 1 punches the baddie, while PC2 talks to him, while PC3 cooks him a delicious breakfast... all at the same moment" to keep the narrative more "grounded in reality" (this was a dark and gritty supers game, and dare I say... yuck... 'realistic'? I didn't want to go crazy).  But, what I did let happen, and which worked well, was that I let the players strategize (that is to say, it simply happened and I saw no reason to stop it). Instead of forcing them to each play one turn and come back to me, I let them decide who went next, and how.<br/><br/>Like, say Travis was throwing down with some combat. He's playing heavy Spades cause that's what he's got the most of. Matthew and Tim would hang back until Travis played a few rounds. Then when Travis started looking nervous, Matthew would step in and switch the conflict over to something else, like Mental powers, using Hearts.  Turns out that Tim's got some Hearts, so he jumps in the next turn and plays, and Tim and Matthew would go back and forth for a bit. Then maybe once they get low, Travis would step in again with Spades and flip back to combat. It built a really cohesive, sensible narrative.<br/><br/>Also, they didn't lay down all their cards and show each other what they had. It was kind of an unspoken agreement (it just happened that way) that we played it like the board game "Shadows Over Camelot": That is, Tim wouldn't show everyone that he's got some high cards or jokers, but he might allude to being able to kick ass with Diamonds. They also wouldn't put their cards together, like Matthew's 3-Diamond and Travis' 5-Diamond to flip the suit to Diamonds, etc. Everyone played their own cards. But within those constraints, they built off of each other like it was a rolling combo attack in a fighting video game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105020/#Comment_105020" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T12:13:50+00:00" title="October 26, 2007 12:13PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, for cards that's what we did too.

I don't have my book with me now, but I'd bet money that the above is a convention hack.  I think the rule is that it doesn't matter if one, two or five PCs are involved, each with their own conflict track: When you (the player's "side") lose the conflict, you can only stack one of those cards on the story arc track. In other words, max of one card stacked on the arc each time. I could be wrong, though, but it seems a little weird: The rules indicate that you set up stakes in a conflict: What if we win, what if the baddie wins". It seems weird to have three PCs going into a conflict, each with totally different stakes, that would require them o be mutually exclusive...<br/><br/>I'm smelling that that was either a hack, or that the rules have changed since the book was released...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105322/#Comment_105322" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T07:33:08+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  7:33AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Andy,<br/><br/>The rules have not changed on page 113 Michael describes the varius styles of play. In slower paced Campaign Style or "Limited Series" play, only one spot in the story arch can be filled per conflict.  When Michael and I run conventionevents, we use a combination of "The New Creative Team" and "The oversized annual" allowing multiple slots of the storyarch to be filled in a single conflict and each player who yeilds can fill 2 slots of the story arc with a single card.  <br/><br/> <br/>Having multiple player conflicts using one track is something that Michael and I have been talking about since Origins when Don Corcoran ran "With Great Pirates" that way.  Its good to read how that would play.  <br/><br/>I use the book these days mostly for the one page on how many cards you get before you scale down to 7 in a conflict.  I have page 83 printed out as my cheat sheet at conventions.<br/><br/>When you are switching back to a previously played suit in a conflict you do not have to swtch back to the tactic you used when you first played the suit.  You do have to change tactics, but you can change it to anything.  If I start using the persuasion tactic and play a club, and then switch to punching with diamonds, if I want to switch back to clubs I must change tactics away from punching, but I can change it to any tactic, not just persusuaion.<br/><br/>Another note on switching back to a former suit -  If I switch back to clubs I need to know if I the highest club played in the conflict, is on my side of the conflict.  If it isn't, then the club I play must beat the highest club played on the other side of the conflict.  <br/><br/>So if the last club I played was a 10 and the last club the GM played was a Jack, then I need to play atleast a queen to switch back to clubs and since you have to discard a card of the same suit but higher than the one you want to play in order to switch suits then I have to discard atleast a Queen or higher in order to play a Queen.  That makes switching back to a previous suit expensive.<br/><br/>However if I last played a Jack and the GM last played a 10 I can play any low club in order to switch suites and the GM would be facing My jack rather than what I played.  So If I have a 5 and a 4 of clubs I discard the 5 and play the 4 but the GM has to deal with my Jack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller" title="Kat Miller"><img alt="Kat Miller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.enter.net/~whim/picks/ittykat.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kat%20Miller">Kat Miller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105324/#Comment_105324" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T07:38:06+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  7:38AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thought I am having able mulible tracks vs a single track of conflict would be to have a page of conflict per villian rather than per hero.

When we played it, it took us 6 sessions, IIRC (i could be off by one, either way) to get to spot 5--though, like Andy's group, they hit spot 4 twice, to steal two of my decks. And it felt like a breakneck pace, to me, with hardly anything going on but the conflicts and a few bridging scenes. I can't imagine how you could possibly do that in 4hrs. Well, maybe with the optional rule where you fill multiple spaces after a single conflict. --oh, wait, you must've been using the Super-Size Annual rules, where it would only take 3 cards to complete the story arc, and multiple players could contribute cards due to losing a single conflict.\n<blockquote>You don't need to beat the high card to switch back to a suit, I don't think, but you do need it to win. I think you can switch back using some low cards, you'll fail, but maybe you have an ace up your sleeve for the next action (I could be wrong here, but since you play two cards and discard the high to switch, I don't see how it really works the other way). But even then, you'll lose options.  I think that's a great part of the flow of losing the battle.  As you get pounded and more harried your options shrink.</blockquote>\nNo, it's definitely supposed to track for the duration of a given conflict, on a given conflict sheet. You can't switch to a suit without beating the highest card in that suit that has been played by your opponent. You *can* switch to a suit that you have the high card in, without beating your own high card. But i can see how it could be unclear--that was one of the questions i had to email the author about before we played, because i wasn't sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195357/#Comment_195357" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-03T20:32:07+00:00" title="March  3, 2009  8:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <a href="http://cobweb.scarymonsters.net/~corleyj/gaming/interview.html" rel="nofollow">interviewed</a> Andy tonight about this game via AIM.
