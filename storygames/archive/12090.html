In an effort to solidify these concepts and help learn to design for them I've begun using 750words.com as a daily (ocassionaly semi-daily) impetus.  Basically in any given entry, I'll read through a game and listing mechanics and elements I find notable and try to analyze how all of the CA's would handle/respond to them.  I'm also playing around with mimicing tone, on games where it's a distinguishing feature (might as well try to practice style too).  Of course, personal opinion will leak in to some degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main questions are:<br/>\n1. Is there an audience for this?  Even you're unlikely to write up a reponse, would you be interested in reading these?<br/>\n2. Do you guys think this will be an effective method for learning to develop better games?<br/>\n3. Will you offer feedback on my interpretation of the CA's?<br/>\n4. I have general worry about repetitiveness.  If we're looking at common mechanis will a given CA's react in the same or similiar way and if so at what point does it stop being noteworthy?<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is 750+ words on the last few sections of Penny for my thoughts:<br/>\nPenny's lack of mechanics is throwing me. It deals with alienation, but it has an elephant in the room feel to it. The methodology of addressing it by mechanics and obviously avoiding the authors direct views on it put forth a layered take on the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nPenny doesn't represent itself as happy exactly, but I think that only scratches the surface. Even in the hands of it's intended audience I the work could be perverted. A stuborn narrativist could crush its delicate spirit by simply continuing on with his plan no matter what actions his guides are suggesting. Offering what, I think, can only be nihilistic view with respect to whether or not our actions matter.<br/>\n(This may relate to, or help generalizing, issues of railroading and aspects concerning agency.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I'm also noticing how my own tone changes as I continue examining the game. A bit more familiar, more comfortable now.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 63<br/>\nPenny shares some thoughts on its creation.<br/>\n(Penny for my thoughts breaks character here. I probably ought to too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of design was to create a game that encouraged players to understand the sorts of actions that others found interesting.<br/>\n(I feel like bartle's heart vector describes this better than anything. In teresting themes and conflicts are narrativist and the setting and support characters don't hjave much time to develop symbolism.)<br/>\n<br/>\nbringing in unpredictable and surprising elements to story telling<br/>\n<br/>\np 65<br/>\nPlaying with form<br/>\nThere's the perspective of the text, but what helps it work is the ease of entry into the game. The process is laid out in a order able to be read aloud and worked through in one pass.<br/>\n(This seems like a big thing. It really takes a in depth look at how the book is intended to utilized and optimizes for that. I really respect that. I'll need to keep that in mind.)<br/>\n<br/>\n"I'm fascinated by the problems of memory, experience and personal identity."<br/>\n(Not quite alienation, but close enough where I'll this one a win.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 66<br/>\nCover your ass clause. If anyone in the group has ptsd or other problems talk about it before you play.<br/>\n<br/>\np 67<br/>\ndiscussion of how first sessions generally end up pretty out there<br/>\n(Interesting relation to how people relate to most rules of role playing games. Do games like flux and 1kbwc play to these instincts? To begin simply and then expand outward? I don't see much success in the other direction. Is it just learning curve convinience?)<br/>\n<br/>\nUncomfortable subjects should be dealt with by breaking character and discussing whether or not we like that direction for game and why.<br/>\n(It's good that this is pointed out. Incidently I'm little unerved by games that take a dark tone. I think I need to tke some time to sort out why I love dark television so much.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 68<br/>\nthe separation of a character from his actions is partially from an improv game color, emotion, advance. In color mood players describe setting, in emotion how they felt, and only in advance mode can they describe actions.<br/>\n(We can look larger scales than just specific abilities and smaller ones that complete narrative control.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 69<br/>\nThe work itself and it's premise are very simulationist. But, only here in it's brief discussion of the inspiration for it variants does this perspective strongly enter play.<br/>\n(I hadn't really considered that one could write a game from a perspective unique from the game's play. Does this broaden appeal or misrepresent? Also the notion of premise being separated from play intent is pretty interesting.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 70<br/>\ngames that inspired penny for my thoughts<br/>\nMunchausen<br/>\n1001 nights<br/>\nthe court of the empress<br/>\nPolaris<br/>\nLacuna part 1<br/>\nPrime time adventures<br/>\ndon't rest your head<br/>\nserial homicide unit<br/>\n<br/>\np 73<br/>\nSetting outline<br/>\nCreated as a list of assurances<br/>\nHelps define the genre of game.<br/>\n(the assumed normalacy may be why I don't see must room for simulationists in the game.)<br/>\n<br/>\np 75<br/>\nflow chart of play<br/>\n(Seems like an obvious handout and great tool for oragnizing ideas. This maybe more useful to me than the whole minute of game play approach.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(I think the form of this game may be more interesting than the play. It's construction is so open and it topics lean toward taboo. I feel like it's almost daring people to offend one another.

Do you guys think this will be an effective method for learning to develop better games?</blockquote>\nI think any kind of critical thinking regarding games will help one become a better game developer. As long as you do not apply theory blindly, because I think you're missing some of the finer points of it, you should be fine.\n<blockquote>3. Will you offer feedback on my interpretation of the CA's?</blockquote>\nSure. I'll start now, at risk of turning this thread into another one of those infamous threads. <br/><br/>I think you've misunderstood something about Creative Agenda in general. CA describes an emergent property of an instance of actual play. Thus you can say that that game of D&amp;D 4E you played with your friends was (or was not) Gamist. You're on slippery ground as soon as you start talking about individual players as having Creative Agendas or talking about games as having Creative Agendas. Sure, the articles talk about this game or that game being Narrativist or whatever, but it's a shortcut for saying that the game is a good tool for producing Narrativist play. Likewise, when you say a person is Simulationist, you're talking about an individual's general preference for a certain kind of play. I think, if you watched me play different games for a year, you'd have a hard time putting a GNS label on me. I play all sorts of games and these actual play sessions see different Creative Agendas at work (and some probably without any CA at work, unfortunately).<br/><br/>Most of Forge theory / The Big Model describes behavioral patterns, not rules text. The essays sometimes analyze how the theory intersects with rules as written, and that gives people the impression that TBM is a good tool for analyzing rules text, but I think it's not well developed for that.\n<blockquote>4. I have general worry about repetitiveness. If we're looking at common mechanis will a given CA's react in the same or similiar way and if so at what point does it stop being noteworthy?</blockquote>\nMechanics taken individually fall into the Techniques layer of The Big Model. Creative Agenda is a spear that punches through all the layers. That means that you cannot predict CA as a function of a single Technique or game mechanic. You can predict how collections of game mechanics might influence the Creative Agenda of a group at play, but the other layers (especially Social Contract) will play a big part in defining the CA of the instance of play, if it even has a CA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270807/#Comment_270807" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T10:41:34+00:00" title="May 12, 2010 10:41AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Fred,<br/><br/>When I first read Ron's articles and tried to apply them to my experiences and to facets of games, Ron told me I was doing it wrong.  Apparently this is the norm.  "G or N or S?" says nothing (directly) about the experience of play, or any given moment of player choice/action in play.  CA is intended to describe the behavior of a play group on a larger scale.  So, really, the strongest statement you could make about a game mechanic would be something like "this game appears designed to foster a narrativist CA, and this mechanic expresses/supports that as follows:".<br/><br/>I know this sounds nit-picky, but given your intent to "solidify these concepts and help learn to design for them", I thought it might be relevant.  <br/><br/>I've found that going over my past play and asking others to help me figure out what type of CA was in operation was helpful in "solidifying".  As for designing, I'll throw in my opinion that picking G or N or S as a starting point for design is tough.  There are so many diverse CAs <i>within</i> each of the 3 types, that just picking a type still leaves you with a blank slate.  It makes more sense to me to start with an inspiration for play first, and then to troubleshoot your emerging design for CA coherence as you refine your vision and how you're communicating it.<br/><br/>As for reading a CA-based game analysis, I'd love to!  But only by someone I trust to know the theory.  And knowing how long it took me to "get it", I'm skeptical on that front.<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270830/#Comment_270830" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T14:21:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  2:21PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice idea, I tried to do something similar last year with my "Game Mechani(sm) of the Week" series of blog posts. If I had a good structure to work in from week to week, I might have made some better critiques along that journey. Working on an entire game at a time and isolating a range of mechanisms within that game, then showing how they work together to encourage certain styles of play would certainly be something I'd be interested in reading. <br/><br/><i>My main questions are:<br/>1.

It might help focus my thoughts more and help prepare for when some set items interesting enough to actual write a game around finally hits me.  I'll give expanding on the points bill was curious about a go at point over the next week.  My main opposition to it (essay style reviews) is that I've just always been the sort of person who remebers movies for specific lines (usually the gist of a line).  I'm so much more prone looking at individual points.  <br/>\n<br/>\n@Matthijs<br/>\nMy view of narrativism tended to focus in on the expression of themes in conflict.  I can see how my statement on potential Penny interactions seems to ignore the need for group approval (celebration? admiration?) that's also part of the CA.  Is it that we draw the line differently when it comes to degenerative play?  <br/>\n<br/>\n@ Adam<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  What I'm ideally trying to do is look through a ruleset, pickout an indvidual mechanic, adopt the motives of eachof the CA's in turn, then discuss how a player with each could use that mechanic to further his goals (or how it could degenerate) and potentially discuss modifications to rules to better suit any given CA.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this fit with in the terms of the model?  Is someother perspective of theory that would be better suited?<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I'm more trying to use a CA to interpret a mechanic, than using a mechanics to determine the CA at a given moment of play.  I can see that the broader layers of the big model have influence on how everything carries out, but I'm not convinced that they would invalidate these views taken from an assumed CA.  I'm not trying to be stuborn here, so if I'm missing something people should try to point it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ david<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I'm not seeing how these terms fail when applied at the small scale.  Can the play of group not be looked at as the sum of the intents of the players?  Can the intents of the players not be looked at as sum of the individual decisions they have made?  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour mention of things lacking CA is interesting, and may help me get a handle on if GNS scales or not.  Could you offer up some examples?  To me anything that isn't driven G/N reasoning falls to simulationist.  Basically generated by "What would happen if..."

And page references are disconcerting. I know you ware working on a 750 word limit, but the writing feels constrained. I can't tell what the style is supposed to be from this one sample, but it feels pretty stilted. I am not getting a strong sense of who you are, or what this game is about. I haven't read or played penny, so that's partly my fault, but usually, if I read info about a game, I can piece it together. It is not happening here.<br/>\n  I like how you tried to break the game down into elements, but I think in this case, words are better than page numbers to get your point across.<br/>\n  I think this is a worthwhile exercise and I think you are close to your mark, but maybe either give a preamble of what POV you are using or otherwise indicate what the context is for a particular comment. I am not a heavy commenter, but I would be interested in reading something like this, if it was directly informative (meaning, I don't have to know everyhitng already in order to understand your analysis).<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270846/#Comment_270846" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T16:01:41+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  4:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2010 4:02PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 0bs01337</cite>Can the play of group not be looked at as the sum of the intents of the players?</blockquote>That is what Ron has claimed to me, yes.  If all us gamers were perfect about identifying what really motivates us, then presumably this would not be the case.  But we aren't, so it is.\n<blockquote>Your mention of things lacking CA is interesting, and may help me get a handle on if GNS scales or not.  Could you offer up some examples?</blockquote>Sure.  So, let's say we have a game with a hyper-realistic combat system.  The procedures are all about generating "what would really happen" <i>and</i> about "what would that experience be like?"  The intent is that you get deeply in character and go through this harrowing combat that gives a taste of real-life violence.<br/><br/>So, what type of CA is that?  We have no idea.  It depends on context.<br/><br/>That combat system could be a component of a Gamist game that uses reality-simulation as its competitive arena.  Or it could be a component of a Narrativist game that explores how violence reveals character.  Or it could be part of a Simulationist game that emulates the film <i>Raging Bull</i>.  Or it could be part of a very different Simulationist game that's simply interested in "what's it like to be in a deadly fight?"<br/><br/>If you feel like reading Ron correct me on all sorts of CA things, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22017.0" rel="nofollow">here's an old Forge thread</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/0bs01337" title="0bs01337"><img alt="0bs01337" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/0bs01337">0bs01337</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270855/#Comment_270855" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T18:27:01+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  6:27PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ Vulpinoid<br/>\nThanks for the encouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ taste<br/>\nI'm working in a more theoretical framework here.

Page references are so I can back check over things if I want to compare things in depth somewhere down the road.  The style of the game is fairly distinctive, it's written as a therapy manual.  Part of the problem come from this being the closing cap on the piece rather than starting from the beginning.  Also there was dissonance in tone produced by trying to model it's clinical tone without just staight on personifying the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure where these gaps in description are coming from.  I hadn't really thought it much, originally I was thinking of this as a mostly personal project, but I realize now I've got to keep these things in mind if I'm going to put them up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this will straighten out once I've gotten feedback on write-ups that are more in context.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ david<br/>\n(I'm responding before having a chance to look through th eforge thread so if things are answered directly in there let me know.  Also, if I want to post these over there, what subforum do they belong in?

Even if this was their intent, I'm not sure how precludes, the adoption of a CA's intent and examaning a mechanics from that perspective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe example you offer is essentially what I'd like to try and do.  The mechanic in quetion is a bit broad, but I think the GNS pespective can be applied to all mechanics in a similar way.  When you mentioned actions devoid of CA I thought you meant specific moments in play that couldn't be decribed by any of the CA's rather than ones where there was uncertainty.  Things are very expolratory right now so I'm not sure if I can clarify too much.  I feel like this fits into the why system mattters debate somewhere, but I'm not certain what the canon for that matter is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270866/#Comment_270866" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-12T21:11:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2010  9:11PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always end up saying, in any GNS discussion, that these things are less complicated than their progenitor describes them to be. (Irony: he has said this himself, despite his general verbosity [word?] on the subject of GNS)<br/><br/>I don't really have a hard time imagining what the intent of the designers-as-players is/was, when it comes to those very broad categories that G, N, and S fill. Of course, I always have to play the thing to really know, but even then, it tends to stand out in some way. <br/><br/>Polaris really jumped out at me as Narrativism-related because my play experience, which focused strongly on using the rules (without leaving some out) towards the end of creating something with a real story-shape to it. Not only a beginning, middle, and end (any module can have that), but something that has strong narrative cause and effect.<br/><br/>In my actual play, Simulationism is a little hard to nail down - there have been "rules-lite" interpretations of D&amp;D (a recent first session of D&amp;D4 comes to mind), but I can't say I've actually played a game as-written and had it come out Sim. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, I realized that both <i>Apocalypse World</i> and <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i> are Gamist in nature - they both have a lot of color and flair, but they are ultimately about winning the day, beating the boss, rather than the color and flair unto themselves. More importantly: realizing how central victory was to the experience of play, the finish line laid out by the game - so to speak - was what switched me on to these being Gamist RPGs. <br/><br/>I will strongly, strongly agree with David (crap, now I can't figure out who said it...) on the point of "don't choose a CA and work from there" - - it really is absurdly brain-hurty and ... not exactly limiting, but rather frustrating. You end up feeling boxed in all the time, even if you make forward progress.

When we played our characters would go off and have fantastical adventures and wander through these dangerous dungeons fighting monsters and looking for traps.  Thing is our characters rarely ever died and if they did it was pretty much a given there would be resurrection magic to bring them back.  We lived the dream of characters facing these dangerous situations but we didnt step on up to the challenge of it. How well or poorly we as players planned or strategized on ways to get through the dungeon didnt matter, the game wasnt testing our skill we were going to get through the dungeon but we would have the experience of facing those dangers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270911/#Comment_270911" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T07:37:30+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  7:37AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 7:47AM by Bill_White.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things:<br/><br/>(1) To reiterate Adam: I think it's important to recognize that "Creative Agenda" as an empirical thing emerges in play as a consequence of what can be called the "reward cycle": how game-mechanical advantages, fictional consequences, or social benefits (and the utility associated with each by players) are allocated as a result of the actions people take at the table. It's a social fact, in other words. The game-text arguably "underdetermines" CA, although it's possible to talk about the text's CA assumptions (in other words, how the author thinks people should play the game). Likewise, individual players may be said to have CA preferences, although it's probably closer to the truth to say that our tastes (or "sockets" as some would have it) allow us to plug in to a variety of different games and be happy with them as long as it's rewarding to us on its own terms. So, for example, as long as the high-fantasy flavor is there, I might be reasonably happy playing either D&amp;D or Burning Wheel. Does that make me a "Sim" player? Not in any useful way, since it suggests that I and the Lovecraftian genre purist are closer in tastes than a hack &amp; slash dungeoneer. Better to say that my high-fantasy preferences might contribute to a Simulationist CA on the part of a group that I play with.<br/><br/>(2) If you're going to indulge in textual criticism of RPGs, you might want to read these reflections on the craft:<br/><br/>Ahlroth, J.

If you think and think and think and think, but never play, you will be very good at designing games that do theoretical things, but not necessarily any good at developing games that do actual play things.

Within my participation in any sort of creative agenda, there are all sorts of choices I make that are just a matter of personal taste.  Example: I use a weird accent for my character, and no one else at the table cares.<br/><br/>Not to discourage your current inquiries, but I think it's worth pointing out that the G/N/S distinction was formulated largely to address busted play.  It's a way to say, "If you can't all get on the same page about what you're doing, it may be hard to have fun together."  And, further, to say that getting on the same page about the very basic "what we're here to do" is harder for some gamers than agreeing on rules tweaks.  Regarding design, the takeaway is largely, "Don't put your players in a position where they're likely to be confused about what they're there to do."  It's no different than what a designer who's never heard of GNS would tell you:  Have a clear idea of how your game should function socially -- how individual actions get rewarded in the group context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/0bs01337" title="0bs01337"><img alt="0bs01337" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/0bs01337">0bs01337</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271001/#Comment_271001" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T13:37:18+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  1:37PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my main question is:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does/ doesn't GNS work as a psychographic profile for roleplayers (I could be misinterpreting their purpose)?<br/>\n  If it doesn't work is it merely incomplete or do we need something else entirely?<br/>\n    Where do we begin if we do need something else?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271007/#Comment_271007" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T13:55:58+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  1:55PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might work, but you're outside Forge / Big Model theory if you go that route. You're applying your own "GNS as a psychographic profile" theory then. <br/><br/>The Big Model only recognizes Creative Agenda as an emergent property of a complete instance of play with a set of players, often measured over multiple sessions. <br/><br/>The main reason that GNS doesn't work as a player profile is that players like different things at different times. For example, you can categorize food as sweet or savory, but you can't categorize an eater as sweet or savory and have it mean the same thing. You might categorize an eater as sweet-loving or savory-loving, but it isn't a very good profile scheme because most eaters love both savory foods and sweet foods at different times. The best you can do is find out what kind of food they're in the mood for right now.<br/><br/>One way to look at Creative Agenda is outcome. Because you need to see the complete instance of play -- which basically conforms to a complete reward cycle -- you cannot judge Creative Agenda (except for guessing) until you see that people got rewarded for playing in the way they wanted to be rewarded, as a group. <br/><br/>Another way to look at Creative Agenda is a shared set of goals and aesthetic concerns for creating play. "Hey, guys, let's play a certain way with the promise that we'll get this specific kind of reward for it at the end, and let's all make sure that everything we do drives toward that payoff." You can't have that collaborative reward-aiming-and-sharing without other people on the same page. You can't share goals and aesthetics with yourself. That's not sharing...<br/><br/>Does this help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271010/#Comment_271010" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-13T14:03:12+00:00" title="May 13, 2010  2:03PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2010 2:05PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: 0bs01337</cite>Why does/ doesn't GNS work as a psychographic profile for roleplayers (I could be misinterpreting their purpose)?</blockquote>\nI'm going to link you to an article I wrote a ways back.

This addresses my confusion regarding CA - specifically, why didn't my trad-gamer buddy acknowledge the inherent usefulness of GNS theory, gol' durn it?<br/><br/>I know I jumped at the idea when I heard it. That was, of course, because I always glommed onto anything storyful about games, tossing aside tactical stuff and excess color 'cause they didn't seem to fit smoothly (or at all) with the goal of telling a cool story. Now that I've played games that are aware of CA, and much more directly support specific kinds of play/play priorities, I find myself quite enjoying tactical and color stuff, much more than before, because I know why I'm at the table, what the game can help me do, and, most importantly, that I'm not being "robbed" of a good storygame experience - there's no storygaming promise to be broken, if that makes sense. <br/><br/>But yeah, introducing the idea that priorities on *this* level might differ between players... that IS the meat of GNS, isn't it?

For my own part, I think that the phenomena discussed by GNS theory reflect psychological phenomena and even individual inclinations and preparedness - that is, people play according to GNS patters because the underlying cause for the existence of Creative Agenda are psychological phenomena. However, GNS theory itself doesn't say anything useful about psychology of individuals: we know that some people like making stories in a narrativistic way, but the theory doesn't comment on why this is so. That is in the purview of some sort of psychological discipline, I imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271065/#Comment_271065" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-14T03:07:51+00:00" title="May 14, 2010  3:07AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These might not quite be what you're looking for, but since you mentioned the Magic: the Gathering psychographic profiles, I thought I'd throw them out there. "Robin's Laws of Good Game Mastering" by Robin Laws and available from Steve Jackson Games's "Warehouse 23" webstore as a PDF gives some RPG psychographic profiles. I last read them before I got into all this Big Model stuff or indie games or what not, so I can't comment on their all inclusiveness or correctness, but they certainly are a stab at individual psychological motivations for types of play. Pretty much the same models are put forward in the D&amp;D 4E DMG, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the Forge article "RPGs and Ritual Discourse" delves somewhat into the individual/group psychological state as it relates to RPGs, but less with individual motivations for types of play and more for what all RPGs share.
