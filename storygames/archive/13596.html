Bonus points if you know the person well enough for them to be interested in helping you out for personal or craft reasons. The advantage of this method is that you have some idea of who might be able to playtest your game meaningfully, and the people you ask will have to specifically think of whether they can help you; most playtest opportunities are missed simply because the right person never considers the chance seriously, either not seeing it or not recognizing that it is he, specifically, who well might play this game this season.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307298/#Comment_307298" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-07T10:33:49+00:00" title="January  7, 2011 10:33AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I have a few folks who would be down for that, actually.<br/>Heh, I should probably award major bonus points for asking folks who have previously and enjoyably (for them and for me) playtested games.

Newman</cite>Playtesting is difficult and frustrating, and often boring.</blockquote>\nI don't mean to pick on Joshua, who I very much respect, but folks say this all the time and it is <i>completely untrue</i>, or, at least, <i>not necessarily so</i>. It really depends on the state of the game that's being playtested and the attitude of the playtesters.  There is a school of thought -- that's slowly gaining traction I think -- that playtesting need not be easily distinguished from just playing an enjoyable hack -- something pieced together from other games that is mostly functional and fun, where the rules might change slightly between different sessions or between different playgroups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
