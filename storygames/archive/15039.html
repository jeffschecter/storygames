Folks had played it in the morning slot and every single person who played it gushed. It was so good there was going to be another game in the very next slot, which I jumped on. I was charged with the distinct purpose of "finding something wrong with it, because we couldn't" (go Morgan). You could say I failed, but I prefer to think of it as a win-win.<br/><br/>I don't have the brain right now for a detailed commentary, so I'll stick with the minimal: it was excellent. I'm bypassing all hyperbole here -- it was simply an excellent and fascinating design that actively improved play, not just one of those games where the design was fine but the players did all the work. The players were awesome but the design kicked us higher and higher.<br/><br/>But now I'm weeping and gnashing my teeth, because the download link does not seem to work.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.filedropper.com/mydaughterthequeenoffrance-gamechef2011" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.filedropper.com/mydaughterthequeenoffrance-gamechef2011</a><br/><br/>Daniel, c'mon.

How many players were there?</blockquote>\n<br/>I can only speak for the first session, Sunday morning:<br/><br/>We played around a table outside in the shade, but about halfway in Shakespeare was pacing back and forth while shuffling papers. Everyone was standing by the time the last scene was played. This strangely mirrors the elements that get added to the scenes after several iterations.<br/><br/>Shakespeare ended it instead of a player rebellion. There was talk of continuing into the next four hour slot. Shakespeare did not explain why he ended when he did. <br/><br/>There was not a single soliloquy, although when we ended several players admitted they were warming them up in their heads. <br/><br/>During the commentary afterward, I asked everyone if they minded being cut off and immediately thrust back into the exact same scene. They unanimously agreed that they didn't mind. They were usually excited since each additional iteration allows them to refine their thoughts and they are rewarded with additional elements to add (2nd iteration adds stage direction, 3rd iteration adds emotional content to lines, 4th iteration adds solilquys).

It's just one more decision that is intended to be made in the sketchy layer between the people at the table and the 'players' in the game/play.<br/><br/>(After writing that I realize that this may not be what people are referring to when they say 'player rebellion' -- there's no mechanical support for any sort of specific 'rebellion' thing in the game other than the ability of the actors to arbitrarily walk out on the play; but of course throughout the game the actors are likely to be in various states of tension vis-a-vis Shakespeare, his daughter, etc. But they have to express that within the leeway/latitude of the game, which as-mentioned is considerable.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean" title="rian_bean"><img alt="rian_bean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/311/nCMERNOS5J27N.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rian_bean">rian_bean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342149/#Comment_342149" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-10T13:10:02+00:00" title="September 10, 2011  1:10PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in both sessions of My Daughter on Sunday. First session, I was an actor/friend. Second session, I played Shakespeare, in order to see both sides of the play possibilities before I continued my eternal gushing about the game.<br/><br/>All around, this game was beyond-all-expectations fantastic. When it was pitched, I didn't know what it was about, mechanics-wise, but was blown away by the limits and certainties, and how much they <b>inspired</b> my play, rather than constricted it. <br/>I want to dive into full AP, but I don't have much time at the moment, so:<br/><br/> Both games were not only challenging (in the best way- I was excited and enthralled each time a new installment of a scene morphed and grew) to play, but evoked highly emotional and moving responses in me. During the second session of the day (yes, 6+ hours of playing this game),as Shakespeare, I was swept away by the emotional impact of watching my friend's reenact my memories, and all the sides of my daughter they revealed- sides I had largely ignored in her, or had never known existed. <br/><br/>I ended up physically removed from the actors (across the room from the table, with a ream of papers in my hand, sitting tense and intense on the edge of my chair) and knew the moment the play was ended- after two intimate and touching soliloquies and after the 6th installment of our Final Conflict was reenacted- Shakespeare saw, for the first time, that what he had thought were "hidden motivations" behind his daughter's departure were, instead, glaringly obvious to everyone but himself- and he was forced to confront the painful reality of his role in running her out of his life. I found myself, as a player, incredibly close to tears while simultaneously relieved and excited to have discovered this clear moment of emotional closure. <br/><br/>This is, hands down, the best game I've played in a long, long while (and that was true after two back-to-back sessions) both in how the innovative mechanics worked, and in its staggering emotional power. <br/>I want to shout praise about it from every internet rooftop, and I can't wait to play it again.<br/>Also, possibly my favorite quote about it:<br/><br/>Harry: I wouldn't play this game at a meet up night, with strangers.<br/>Me: Why not?<br/>Harry: Because if they broke this game for me, I think I would cry. <br/><br/>Daniel: brilliant!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342206/#Comment_342206" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-10T23:47:10+00:00" title="September 10, 2011 11:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2011 11:47PM by Joli.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I so, so regret missing this, both slots.

How did the scenes shake out, in terms of new scenes vs. re-interpreted scenes? How many scenes in total, how many replays, that sort of thing? Was there a clear 'central scene' that got played many more times than others? Were any scenes played only once? Twice? If you were an actor; did you ever wish that Shakespeare would go back to a previous scene that he instead avoided? If you were Shakespeare; what sort of thoughts/feelings tended to inform your scene choices? Were you ever afraid to replay a scene, because you thought it would get worse ('worse' meaning either emotionally or dramatically)?<br/><br/>2. How many soliloquys were delivered in your game? Was the limit on soliloquys (one per player per character) ever a consideration? Were there any interpretations/playthroughs where soliloquys were allowed, but nobody delivered one? If there was more than one soliloquy in your game: how were they distributed, in terms of scenes and characters?<br/><br/>3. How widely did subsequent interpretations of scenes vary? How much thinking-ahead did you do, going into a scene that had already been played, about what you wanted to do differently? <br/><br/>4. Did characterization feel consistent between actors (i.e. when different actors were playing the same character in the same scene?) Did actors gravitate towards particular roles? Was there ever jockeying or competition for a particular role in a scene, and if so how did you resolve it?<br/><br/>5. How important were the <i>certainties</i> to play? Did they become central to scenes, did some become more important than others, were they shoehorned in at the last minute? Did the group ever forget about a certainty by accident? For actors: when there was a certainty that applied to your character in particular, what was that like? For Shakespeare: did <i>certainties</i> give you a feeling of more control? Less control? Did you ever regret making something a certainty later on? Did you ever allow an out-of-scene actor to contribute to creating certainties?<br/><br/>6. How useful were the Questions in helping you get into the game/situation? What was your favourite Question? Were there any questions that seemed to be missing?

I hope others will chime in from that game with more in-depth responses. <br/><br/><br/><i>1. How did the scenes shake out, in terms of new scenes vs. re-interpreted scenes? How many scenes in total, how many replays, that sort of thing? Was there a clear 'central scene' that got played many more times than others? Were any scenes played only once? Twice? If you were an actor; did you ever wish that Shakespeare would go back to a previous scene that he instead avoided? If you were Shakespeare; what sort of thoughts/feelings tended to inform your scene choices? Were you ever afraid to replay a scene, because you thought it would get worse ('worse' meaning either emotionally or dramatically)?</i><br/><br/>I think we ended up with about 5 total scenes, all of which had been done more than once, and about two of which allowed soliloquies. Once or twice, I let a scene run for just a few lines, then restarted it without adding a certainty. I thought this would be annoying to the actors, but they seemed to like the intensity of it. <br/><br/><br/><i>2. How many soliloquys were delivered in your game? Was the limit on soliloquys (one per player per character) ever a consideration? Were there any interpretations/playthroughs where soliloquys were allowed, but nobody delivered one? If there was more than one soliloquy in your game: how were they distributed, in terms of scenes and characters?</i><br/><br/>We had no soliloquies, although there were some brewing, according to the actors. <br/><br/><i>3. How widely did subsequent interpretations of scenes vary? How much thinking-ahead did you do, going into a scene that had already been played, about what you wanted to do differently?</i><br/><br/>They varied quite widely. There diversity was aided by the fact that different people played different characters most times. Interestingly, certain things might come up again and again in a new light, despite the fact that they weren't certainties. Whenever anyone gathered together for a picture in the graduation scene, we <br/><br/><i>4. Did characterization feel consistent between actors (i.e. when different actors were playing the same character in the same scene?) Did actors gravitate towards particular roles? Was there ever jockeying or competition for a particular role in a scene, and if so how did you resolve it?</i><br/><br/>Characterization varied wildly, which was great. Tori was playing a woman, Raquel, who saw other women as rivals and she had a dim view of WS' daughter. She acted quite the brat whenever she played her. Fascinatingly, when Tori played Raquel in a scene, she acted just as harshly, but we learned all kinds of reasons why we should identify with Raquel and excuse her boorish actions. <br/><br/>This is my favorite part, that you are playing an actor who knows Shakespeare. Once I started putting the actors in scenes, it got awesome. You'll hear this suggestion on the recording, but I wanted to know more information about my actors in the beginning, because I see WS as trying to get a particular state, and if I know my actors a little better, then I can try adding them to scenes like ingredients. (The fact that they might play themselves as protagonists, or that another actor might play them differently each time only adds to my delicious frustration). <br/><br/><i>5. How important were the<i>certainties</i>to play? Did they become central to scenes, did some become more important than others, were they shoehorned in at the last minute? Did the group ever forget about a certainty by accident? For actors: when there was a certainty that applied to your character in particular, what was that like? For Shakespeare: did<i>certainties</i>give you a feeling of more control? Less control? Did you ever regret making something a certainty later on? Did you ever allow an out-of-scene actor to contribute to creating certainties?</i><br/><br/>We forgot about certainties all the time. It didn't hurt that much. We dealt with it in two ways 1) we might end a scene without the certainty being used, 2) or another actor would point to the certainty and look at the forgetful player. <br/><br/>They rarely were central to the scenes, but I think that was my fault for generally picking soft certainties. Eventually, I started adding really hard ones at the beginning of scenes. They are a fantastic ingredient.<br/><br/><i>6. How useful were the Questions in helping you get into the game/situation? What was your favourite Question? Were there any questions that seemed to be missing? Did any actor have a relationship with the Daughter that they kept secret? For the actors: how did you feel about answering questions privately, and not sharing the result with the group? For Shakespeare: did you tell the other players (after the game, I hope!) about the secret hope you had for your daughter?</i><br/><br/>It seemed like most of the actors in the first session had lots of secrets they wanted to keep. I wish they were forced to divulge a bit more of the info on their sheets. It is pretty difficult to get any of that out there without them stating some things up front. Maybe they could choose 3 or four questions that they had to reveal, allowing them to keep some things secret? There just isn't time in a game to out everyone's secrets while finding out what the heck is up with WS' daughter. <br/><br/>I really wish there was something at the top that had their names and that they were forced to divulge them. I should at least know their names, right? (Also, knowing their names let's me put them in scenes). <br/><br/>Is there a cool reason why there aren't names on there? <br/><br/><i>7. Did you guys use the 'play aids' in the back of the PDF, i.e. the scene sheets and question sheets? Were they helpful/important, or not really?</i><br/><br/>We used the heck out of the scene sheets and question sheets. They were completely necessary. Other than prettying them up a bit and adding names, they seemed perfectly good. Quite functional. It would be hard to play without them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342340/#Comment_342340" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T21:28:54+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  9:28PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>Is there a cool reason why there aren't names on there?</blockquote>\nHeh, no, that's simply a matter of omission -- one I actually noticed just the other day, reading back over the text.<br/><br/>Most of the actor-questions that are kept private are fairly internal, ethical sort of questions that are meant primarily to get the actors on a certain wavelength vis-a-vis the situation, but I can see how it might be useful to have a few more public-facing questions there.<br/><br/>It's interesting that, at least from the Shakespeare perspective, you had a lot of interest in who the actors were as characters in their own right.

And was great. Nothing is more fun than playing yourself playing yourself in a scene and getting to stand on your tiny (thinly veiled) soapbox and indirectly lecture Shakespeare.

Was Raquel the actor that Tori was portraying, who she then also played in scenes? i.e. the actor was playing herself?<br/></blockquote>\nRight, Raquel was the actor that Tori played and answered questions for. WS put Raquel in a scene with his daughter and Cameron (another actor played by Jackson) and some poignant things came out when Raquel finally played \u201cRaquel the character\u201d in an iteration of the scene. Raquel had played Shakespeare's daughter several times before this, always in a terrible light. Later, when she played herself, we saw that she viewed WS' daughter as a threat to her relationship with Cameron, and she martyred the shit out of the situation. It was awesome. WS helped nudge towards conflict by adding certainties like: Dialogue, Raquel, "Fuck you both."<br/><br/>It's a strong move for WS to bring in the actors as characters. It ups the ante and removes one layer of obfuscation from their motives if they take the bait and play themselves. The best part is they will always take the bait.  When WS puts their actor in a scene as a character they might let someone else play them the first few times. But they\u2019ll inevitably get mad and want to show how things \u201creally went down\u201d, at least according to their character. It\u2019s illuminating. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><br/>To some degree this is intentional -- Shakespeare doesn't really know how his friends feel about the whole thing until he sees them playing out his scenes -- but can you think of any particular things you would have liked to know, other than their relationship with the Daughter?</blockquote>\nI definitely want to know their names, how old they are, and how I know them; that\u2019s basic information that they currently aren\u2019t required to provide. The answers to the other questions are a little trickier. <br/><br/>The way I see it, there are two fun parts to the questions: 1) Agendas that are 2) secret.<br/><br/>The questions promote the actors to have agendas of their own, which is fantastic. It is also fun for them to have secrets, simply because having secrets is fun. Here\u2019s the problem; if the agendas are too secret, then we may never get foreshadowing or clues. That makes the big reveal at the end fall flat. If someone who was never seen or alluded to was the killer at the end of the mystery novel, the reader feels cheated.<br/><br/>(Side note, we read the answers to our questions off at the end. Does it say to do so? I forget. I thought it was cool, but it might conflict with the current end conditions, which I wouldn't want changed). <br/><br/>I think you could preserve some secrecy, while giving the players the chance to hint at their agenda from the start, and then you get that pleasant callback/reincorporation thing and foreshadow the reveal. <br/><br/>The most basic way to do this is to require the players to announce three of the six answers they have. They get to choose, so they can keep the secrets they want, but since many of the questions are linked, we can get a better sense of what might be hiding behind the curtain. Most of our players revealed none of the answers to their questions, which I don\u2019t think is as strong a move as they were thinking. There are actually fewer opportunities to reveal these hints subtly than you might think, and many can be overlooked during the excitement. There are probably more elegant solutions for hints than the one I just suggested, but I do think that the dial needs to be turned in the \u201cmore information\u201d direction somehow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342537/#Comment_342537" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-13T03:43:43+00:00" title="September 13, 2011  3:43AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually I can't help thinking that this game should be played with no secrets, and all the relevant informations in plain sight.

The version on Ben's site is the most up-to-date version available at the moment. It is totally playable as-is. <br/><br/>But if you were about to play it this very moment and asked me for advice, I would say to add the following questions to the Friends' Questions sheets:<br/><br/>1. What is your name?<br/>2. How do you know Shakespeare (are you an actor, family friend, producer, etc.?)<br/><br/>With instructions to share your answers with Shakespeare and the others.<br/><br/>Also there is a useful physical play-aid trick: write out little name-tag pyramids (you know, fold a paper in half so it stands up on the table, put the name on it) for all the characters who appear in scenes. Then when you are going to interpret/play a scene, you can use them as physical markers to more easily keep track of who is playing who in the scene.<br/><br/>Finally, while reading the game out loud (minus the questions of course) is generally the easiest way to teach it, there is one particularly confusingly-written paragraph about soliloquys, which can be more easily explained by saying:<br/><br/>1. Soliloquys are limited to the roles of Shakespeare and his Daughter.<br/>2. Each player can only perform a soliloquy once for each of them over the course of the game.<br/>3. There can only be one soliloquy total per individual scene playthrough/interpretation.<br/><br/>I hope the game goes well, and you return to tell us all about it. Or tell me in whispers. Or keep it a secret forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353173/#Comment_353173" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T20:08:47+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  8:08PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2012 8:16PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I just wanted to say that I finally (finally!) got around to listening to the second of the CozyCon recordings, and I really did appreciate the mid-session guided tour I received through Tori's house -- also, all the players constantly addressing me as though I were present certainly kept my attention from wandering. I almost felt like maybe I got to attend a little bit of CozyCon, after all.</blockquote>\nWe didn't want you to feel like those moments of dead silence were bad-juju moments. Everyone was just sitting and thinking very intently, but in an audio-only recording it could sound like we were gaming in a morgue and the fun was on a slab. Not true!<br/><br/>You were definitely there by proxy. After playing people were running around screaming "rrraahh! Daniel!"<br/><br/>Another play trick (which I think the Story Games Seattle crew came up with): for each scene, write the Certainties on index cards (one card per character) so you can pass that card to the person playing the character in the scene. That way they can just glance at their card to remember what they need to stick in the scene rather then leaning over and reading the small print on the scene sheet. Less disruptive. As you add new Certainties for particular characters just add it to that same card.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353179/#Comment_353179" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T20:59:44+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  8:59PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oo, good one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353182/#Comment_353182" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T21:18:42+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  9:18PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!

It was pretty great. It reinforces the creative constraint and there is a certain tension that can be created when one person at the table is mostly and noticeably silent.<br/><br/>Actors: As far as players go, discussion between scenes seems like a good time to speak in your actor\u2019s voice, but when we played, we were often busy doing the social cue thing; congratulating each other, joking, and other various out of character bits. This is my habit from other games that have scenes. After a scene, you can say things like, \u201cI love what you did there,\u201d and make jokes and stuff. It seems to provide a release. But if we prohibit out of character discussion except during breaks, will it enhance the tension and cause bleed and make the game more fun? What if someone needs clarification?

As you add new Certainties for particular characters just add it to that same card.</blockquote>\nI've played it with this play trick a few times, and it was pretty helpful.

This is certainly something I have spent a lot of time thinking about, and so far my approach has been to just make the spirit of the rules (re: tabletalk and communication between Shakespeare and his friends, specifically) as clear as possible, and set enough hard rules that people understand that they <i>could</i> play it that way, if they decided to. Where 'that way' is not a specific set of rules, but a nebulous constellation of possibilities -- the point is to establish the general notion that 'maybe in this game tabletalk is not like other games', so that the group is less likely to simply default to something. At that point the parts of the game that are not covered by explicit rules -- like, can the actors talk to each other between scenes? -- are up for grabs for explicit or implicit group negotiation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>Actors: As far as players go, discussion between scenes seems like a good time to speak in your actor\u2019s voice, but when we played, we were often busy doing the social cue thing; congratulating each other, joking, and other various out of character bits.

Here\u2019s the first:<br/><br/>Players = real people<br/>Actors = Shakespeare\u2019s friends.<br/>Roles = People that Shakespeare said are in a scene. Actors pick Roles to play during a scene. <br/><br/><br/><br/>So we played again last night and I put forth a few options about table talk:<br/><br/>  1.\tPlayers can talk outside of scenes, but you must always remain in the character of your actor.<br/>  2.\tPlayers can talk out of character and joke around.<br/>  3.\tPlayers must sit silently between scenes. The only speaking that occurs is through the voice of your actor while choosing roles. <br/><br/>Both of these are different from how we\u2019ve played in the past. In previous games, we all just shut up until Shakespeare gave us a scene, which provides the intensity that Tori alludes to.<br/>Last night, we chose option one. It quickly became clear that we would need to speak out of character for things like rules clarifications and breaks, so we made an ad hoc rule that you would hold up a pen if you needed to speak OOC. In general, we stayed quiet. We would interject a few comments using our characters\u2019 voices, and a couple of interesting things were said, but we focused on using the scenes to say what needed to be said to Shakespeare and each other. After scenes we would do the "attaboys" in character, like you talk about in your post above, Daniel. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheatsheet for AP:<br/>Ross \u2013 Shakespeare (Shakespeare\u2019s daughter is named Viola).<br/>Jackson \u2013 Carmen (Shakespeare\u2019s friend)<br/>Morgan \u2013 Malcolm (Shakespeare\u2019s current brother-in-law).<br/>Robert \u2013 Pierce (The archery instructor of Shakespeare\u2019s family).<br/><br/>Interestingly, last night turned a bit PVP. Malcolm took the role of Pierce and played him like an aggressive jerk. Then Carmen decided she knew why Malcolm was defending Viola so vigorously. She took the role of Malcolm and made it seem like he and Viola were intimate, to the horror of Malcolm. I played Malcolm playing Viola and it was threefold revulsion. Malcolm is Viola\u2019s uncle through marriage, so I was grossed out, so Malcolm was grossed out, so he played Viola grossed out. Ross would not end the scene and it went on for a gut-wrenching 30 minutes. Definitely my highlight of the night. <br/><br/><br/>I had a great time, but I think my new table talk rule will be number three above. There is no table talk at all, except that after Shakespeare describes the scene, the players can speak in the voice of their actors. Maybe that way you can get the intensity of the silence, but still allow for the catty, \u201cOh I know what\u2019s going on here,\u201d as you reach for the role card that matches my actor. We pretty much defaulted to this last night, and I think it\u2019s the best option. I\u2019d welcome a discussion of why it\u2019s not the best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356268/#Comment_356268" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T09:54:24+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  9:54AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and here's another option that came up in a game I played: break character-role during scenes to give asides as Shakespeare's friend.

They took a dance class together, and he invited her to join his little civic acting troupe. So it's a more intricate relationship than "friend". <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Of course, it didn't work out, in the last few years he (shakespeare) met someone &amp; they got hitched, and his new wife has a younger brother... this guy named Malcolm who is CLEARLY unable to stop from crossing the line with his impressionable *niece* for god's sakes. Also Pierce, archery instructor to both Will and his daughter, Viola, also had an awkward vying-for-Viola's-attention scene with Viola's boyfriend. As Carmen, i was no man-hater, but poor Viola didn't have any trustworthy men around her. Ergo, in a scene playing as her, i asked Pierce (who was playing as me) why all men were the same. And i beseeched him to explain to me about men, and he said that all men were pretty much the same - "that a dude is a dude". (Which, as an aside, is neither a good way to speak nor something that I, Carmen, would ever say) though he did deign to state of Randy, Viola's aforementioned boyfriend; "except Randy. That dude is a don't." <br/><br/>"Um, i am totally not still playing this game, guys, i am totally back to being jackson tegu and have finished portraying Carmen. For real."<br/><br/>Jackson, on the other hand, really enjoyed the in-character table-talk between scenes. Sometimes i wanted to ask, after a scene "Whoa, Pierce, is that how it happened?" But i held myself back. The best thing about it was it let Shakespeare's silence be felt even more. Like, here we are, his friends (but not really friends of one another), sort of catting around over here, and the guy's just scribbling over there, and says, "Ok, this is where you guys are gonna be" and we keep cattily talking for a moment. And he says "Action" and i say something else as Carmen, and Shakespeare says "Action!" again. I liked seeing will as a workhorse in that regard. <br/><br/>It also opened the door for Shakespeare (the director, not a character) to say stuff like, in response to something Malcolm says in an early iteration of a scene "Uh, without demonstrating any emotion, please, Malcolm." Or, in another situation, "No set descriptions, Carmen!" For those unfamiliar, the game slowly releases these conditions; eventually characters may both describe sets &amp; speak with emotion.<br/><br/>But i'm into playing with the silence, too. I've played that way before, and it allowed me to be very in my head, which was beneficial to the psychological nature of the game. So, both ways, either way.<br/><br/>Thanks again Daniel!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356279/#Comment_356279" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T10:22:10+00:00" title="January 27, 2012 10:22AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>break character-role during scenes to give asides as Shakespeare's friend.</blockquote>\nI did this last night, too.

("Did you really write that? Geez...")<br/><br/>He also commented a few times about what a good actor he was -- like after a particular scene or bit of dialogue he might be all 'see? I got depth!'

Play an actor who is a caricature. Daniel playing an actor isn't that different from Daniel playing an actor playing a character. But when I drop Fat Tony to actually start playing a character in a scene, the difference is marked, which simulates Fat Tony's acting skills to a certain degree.<br/><br/>2. Play the actor when you do the line readings. I would make comments about the "script" as the actor, like Daniel notes, but without trying to engage Shakespeare in conversation or anything. These asides are similar to when we as players laugh at stuff and point out things we like, and can replace some of those.<br/><br/>3. Lose more of the actor as you get deeper into the scenes. When you get to the most-developed version of scenes, your actors have probably made all the comments they are going to make, and should be getting down to the business of actually playing the characters. So, essentially, the less of the character in the play you are allowed to play, the more of the actor it seems appropriate to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356401/#Comment_356401" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-27T17:32:53+00:00" title="January 27, 2012  5:32PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, that is some solid advice.
