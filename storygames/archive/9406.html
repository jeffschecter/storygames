I initiated a discussion on this theme some weeks back on the Norwegian rpg-forum, and got a nice debate out of it.<br/><br/>My stance is that as a game-smith I need to be aware of the problems/challenges buried in this kind of issues. The same is true for sexism, of course. I have recently decided that in the new edition of my frpg Fabula I will change the setting to reflect the fact that I live in a multicolored society, and make the standard races multicolored. If I get to the point of publishing this new edition, I will ask for illustrators to populate their drawings with both black, yellow, red, brown and white faces. I will impose a strictly 50/50 balance of men and women too. I find it appealing to think that most potential players are given figures to identify with, by the text and the illustrations. I like the idea that my society is reflected in my game too, even though it is a fantasy-world.<br/><br/>My fantasy-world is not dependent on being all-white, so there is no reason it should stay that way. It will be a <i>polychrome </i>world from now on! ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208520/#Comment_208520" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-21T09:23:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2009  9:23AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2009 9:23AM by Eric Provost.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I am a casual game designer.</p>\n<p>I am racist.</p>\n<p>I am also sexist.</p>\n<p>Therefore, my game designs will also be racist and sexist.

I bit my tongue in the other one. I'll try for rational discourse in this one. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a racist, though I have been known to tell a racial joke on occasion. <br/>\n<br/>\nI make sexist jokes, but I am not sexist.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Christian, white, male and straight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have very strong opinions that many, many of my friends and acquaintances might find repugnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically none of the above has anything to do with what I consider entertaining. RPGs are, to me, about entertainment. They are not about making statements, or educating people. It may be entertaining to explore what it would be like to be a minority, pagan/atheist, female or gay, but if it becomes non-entertaining at any point, I stop doing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo not conflate entertaining with light or frivolous. Exploring depths of emotion and difficult concepts may be entertaining without being superficial. I completely dig "Playing Passionately", and am willing, with the right people, to venture far out of my comfort zone in gaming. I think IWNAY is an amazing, tempting and intimidating concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think race is a worthless concept. Utterly and completely. I think paying attention to it, making allowances for it, discussing it (even as I do it now) apologize for it, blaming it for your misfortunes (even where it is demonstrably true) causes more harm than a rather large number of other things. Cultures are much more valuable and realistic concepts. It's not about appearance, it's about self-identification and enculturation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'll never design a game with "minorities" in mind. I absolutely want all people who like the same sorts of things I'm making a game about to play my games. Their racial makeup is of no consequence to me. Their religion is of no consequence. Their sexual orientation and gender are of no consequence. If I gathered a group of people together who were all black (besides me, of course) atheist lesbians, and we had enough common ground to enjoy each other's company and enough trust to play passionately, I would explore any taboo concepts that caught our collective fancy. But I wouldn't pick such a group to explore certain concepts, or explore certain concepts because of the demographic makeup of the group. The important parts come after the buzzwords. It's not black atheist lesbians you should be paying attention to. It's "common ground" "enjoy each other's company" and "trust" that are important.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I write a game, I am absolutely not going to go out of my way to avoid offending anyone. Ever. Not even a little bit. I also will not attempt to offend anyone on purpose. Most of the time. If I make a game about relationships, I'm not going to make allowances for same-sex relationships. I'm also not going to have a disclaimer saying that if you're a sexual deviant who practices homosexuality that you should avoid my game and get some religion before the devil gits ya. If I make a game about angels and demons, I'm not going to pull my punches and say that they're possibly the psychic constructs of human belief. No, their angels, fighting for God, and demons, fighting for the Devil. Atheists will accept this as "fiction" or they'll go play something else. I will not (who does this anymore? I mean, seriously?) make a game where blacks are big-eyed, big-lipped and lazy sidekicks who run around calling the brawny protagonist 'massah'. I'm also never going to make a roleplaying game that explores the 'black tax'. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is how race and racism will affect my game design and game play.<br/>\n<br/>\n(The will was weak. I couldn't resist.

I will say that I take issue with some of them, as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\na. Culture, yes. Race as a concept aside from culture, no. There are black Americans whom I wouldn't count as part of the 'african-american' culture, having few to none of the defining characteristics and norms of that culture. There are people of Arabic descent, and Muslims, in America who have little to no cultural identification with Middle Eastern Arabs and Muslims.<br/>\nb. You say "treat people from different cultures as people'. Remove the 'from different cultures', and I lose any issue I have with it. treat people as people. Sounds good to me.<br/>\nc. If people say something is annoying/insulting/offensive to them, I ask myself: Why do I care? Do I know this person? Do I care about this person? If the answer is yes, then I will consider it. If not.. I can't be bothered about what people who I don't care about think of me. As I said, I won't go out of my way to insult or offend anyone (most of the time; sometimes there's a specific purpose behind it) so if people are insulted or offended anyway, that's their baggage, not mine. I've got enough of my own to worry about theirs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAra,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm working from the assumption that your goal is to... uh.. Y'know, I don't know that I really understand your goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you want to encourage variety in cultures? Less homogeneity and genericness?<br/>\nDo you want to encourage people to design games that explore racial issues, such as privilege and discrimination?<br/>\nDo you want people to portray a minority in the fiction "realistically" rather than a "generic white guy" who happens to be black/hispanic/asian?<br/>\nDo you want people to STOP portraying minorities with stereotypes? Is this something you've seen, and think needs to stop?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I can assume is that your intentions are wholesome and righteous, and starting a racial flamewar to harsh the zen of S-G isn't your intention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208679/#Comment_208679" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T02:29:37+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  2:29AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2009 3:18AM by johnzo.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couple thoughts.  <br/><br/><b>First, on design:</b> People construct their identities around totally arbitrary things.  Their hobbies, their skin color, their activism, their major, their nationality, their fandom.  Whatever.<br/><br/>If you take that identity-forging thing and portray it negatively or incorrectly or disrespectfully, then congratulations, you've just shrunk your potential market.<br/><br/>Like Brainy Smurf.  Back in the eighties, when I was a little public-school nerd, I suffered because of that little blue fuck.  The Smurfs had serious influence on my Grade 4 class, and if you acted like you knew something, you earned the same treatment that Brainy earned.  It got so that I didn't want to wear my glasses to school. Now that I am a big adult nerd who can kick a football some distance, I want to find the anti-intellectual turdkernel who originated Brainy and attempt field goals with their testicles.<br/><br/>To summarize: it's hard to entertain people at the same time as you're shitting on them.<br/><br/><b>Second, on play:</b> I am DMing a 4E Greyhawk game right now.  Greyhawk has lots of lightly airbrushed human cultures -- the creepy proto-Nazi Suel, wandering in search of their living space, the aboriginal Flan* who are contentedly being pushed aside by the migrating olive-skinned Aerdy imperialists, the Arabesque Baklunish who are off on their own and kind of marginalized, and the Gypsy-ish Rhenee riverboat nomads, who are insular, mistrusted, and culturally non-mainstream.  <br/><br/>At the risk of playing with fire, the tension between various subraces really seemed like the interesting bit about the setting.   One of the PCs is in a law enforcement role, and during a skill challenge I said to him 'you're hearing complaints  about the Rhennee all the time.'  It seemed like an honest thing to say in the moment but following up on that with in-game specifics is gonna have to be handled with some delicacy.  <br/><br/>I don't want my game to Teach An Important Lesson and I don't want to lazily wallow in negative stereotypes and I've got a limited amount of table-time in which to not do all these things.  But at the same time, taking on this challenge in a relatively safe space is almost irresistible.  Writing the other so that they are alien and familiar and sympathetic and unsympathetic all at once -- that's something I want to achieve someday.<br/><br/>(* Flan?

WTF? did Gygax never eat Mexican food up in Wisconsin?)</blockquote>\nMaybe not.  I'm old enough to have seen the mexican culinary thing break wide open in this culture.  My mother was making mexican food waaaay before it was being served here in the states.  That was probably because we grew beans and it made sense.  And she never made flan.  Guacamole and salsa are relatively NEW foodstuffs for the US.<br/><br/>Okay, back to the original topic.  <br/><br/>I'm not a designer of games.  But I do illustrate them.  And i'm white, middle aged, not religious at all.  OF course I'm affected by this stuff. I don't always think of drawing enough women or minorities.  Left to my own devices, I often draw caucasians.  <br/><br/>It is tough when you have a typical fantasy dungeon party (or say sci-fi) and you really do have actual, different SPECIES interacting with each other.  If I have 5 people to get across as "the player characters" and three of the five are a dwarf, elf and an orc...the other two have to take on the entirety of humanity.  I try.  But I don't always succeed.  Sure, I can make the dwarf look like hispanic, but elves are tough.  Mess with those aquiline features and put a different skin tone?  They no longer are elfin.  This is one of the reasons, I think, Drow are not thought of as "people of color" very often.  (Judd has a good diatribe about Drow...hee, hee. )  Most of the Drow I've seen are very caucasian features with a skin tone that can range from the unnatural colors of blue and purple to more realistic skin tones of blue-brown.  Blue is not a color we see in mammals very often.  So it is a wonderful color to say "holy andaran, that person is alien!!!".<br/><br/>In Catspaw, my webcomic, I told my writer, "let's make the main character a woman and black".... just because we have not seen that very often in Sword and Sorcery and Catspaw is about John and my love for sword and sorcery.  And we don't belabor it.  We don't have characters pointing out she is black.  Just present it and move on with the story.  Oh.  She is also bald.  And I love drawing her because she is based on a friend of mine from NYU waaaay back in my early college days visually.  My friend had close cropped hair, wasn't bald.  But bald is interesting on a woman and basically because i just simply liked the visual.  So, like I said, I am trying to be aware of the problem and do something about it.  Because sword and sorcery dates to a time when ALL protagonists were white and the majority of them male.  <br/><br/>I'm getting the chance to do some artwork on the fantasy section for  long running universal RPG system.  The art director and I have exchanged several emails on when and how to change up the pelthora of white options.  I know that the duo I came up with to sorta show Sword and Sorcery tropes is a female mongol-like archer (with strongly indian-asia minor features, clothing) and a Ape-ninja.  I'm hoping that is a dynamic duo that at least plays with the idea of WHO can be the protagonists of stories.  <br/><br/>But part of what I do is illustrate tropes.  Sometimes it is my job to simply do that.  Not tweak or twist the trope, but to go right to the source and do it.  <br/><br/>I had a very interesting conversation with the then producer of Justice League International.  We had a long discussion at a very slow con once about race in comics.  He said that the word came down to make the Justice League Int as poly-cultural as possible.  And there was great interest in having a strong asian Male superhero that was not stereotypical martial-artist.  Dwayne said to me "and did you know Storn, we could not find ONE male who wasn't a martial artist or an offensive buffoon (asian sidekicks were AWFULLY prevalent in the Golden era, Chop-Chop from Blackhawks anyone?) in the 80 years of DC comics history?!?!?"  They ended up going with Doctor Light (japanese woman).  I think that is a pretty scary tidbit.  That is an oversight.  That is a challenge to some DC writer.  C'mon.<br/><br/>Dwayne McDuffy, btw, is the owner of the Milestone line that DC put out a few years ago.  If you know of those comics, they were great. Here is what he said about Milestone and I think it pertains to RPGs as well....\n<blockquote>If you do a black character or a female character or an Asian character, then they aren't just that character. They represent that race or that sex, and they can't be interesting because everything they do has to represent an entire block of people. You know, Superman isn't all white people and neither is Lex Luthor. We knew we had to present a range of characters within each ethnic group, which means that we couldn't do just one book. We had to do a series of books and we had to present a view of the world that's wider than the world we've seen before.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208685/#Comment_208685" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T05:33:46+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  5:33AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Storn: interesting stuff! re: Asian supers, there's a new anthology out, <a href="http://secretidentities.org" rel="nofollow">Secret Identities</a>, that's about Asian-American superheros.

Is she representative of blacks in the setting (her choice in hairstyle, her profession, her attitude) or is she unique? How have readers of the webcomic reacted to her? Does her 'race' ever come up in discussions?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more to say on this, but I don't think I've got my thoughts properly organized. In a fantasy game, it's very different to deal with 'minorities' because the social circumstances that have formed the cultures aren't necessarily present in the fiction, but they're still present in the reader/player. In a setting that is close to our own world, you've got the same circumstances to deal with; Players have a frame of reference to judge the fiction that actually applies to the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I'm not understanding is what is considered "proper" treatment of the issue of race in roleplaying games? Is simply making it clear that characters can have skin tones other than white, either via the text or the accompanying art, sufficient? Do we need to make black/asian/hispanic/etc characters members of specific subcultures which may or may not be analogs of the real world? Do we make 'minority' characters, then thereafter ignore their skin tone, bringing about something approaching my OWN ideal within the fictional setting?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not that I've never thought about it. It's just more that I've never felt it was that important.

I was showing my ladyfriend (a Dine) my rpg books because she was interested in playing. She said it's just a bunch of white folk and white culture represented here. So for her it was a big cultural disconnect. <br/><br/>So that got me thinking about  what resources folks had out there; peoples experiences in designing, writing, drawing; and general opinions on the topic. <br/><br/>And here we are.<br/><br/><br/><b>Do you want to encourage variety in cultures? Less homogeneity and genericness?</b><br/>Less genericness. I am really tired of the generic white fantasy.<br/><br/><b>Do you want to encourage people to design games that explore racial issues, such as privilege and discrimination</b><br/>I think we have some of the tools to do this already. We can play black cowboys in Dust Devil, there is Stealing Away Jordon (Graham pointed that one out), ways cultures are handled in Burning Wheel, Shock can be used to explore these topics as well. <br/><br/><b>Do you want people to STOP portraying minorities with stereotypes? Is this something you've seen, and think needs to stop?</b><br/>It's not really about stopping anything it's more about thinking and educating ourselves. Stereotypes won't ever stop but I think we can at least get a specific background about who a person is. Not just skin tone. <br/><br/><b>All I can assume is that your intentions are wholesome and righteous, and starting a racial flamewar to harsh the zen of S-G isn't your intention.</b><br/>If people want to start a racialflame war that's their problem not mine. I've made no attempt to derail the topic from race in writing, design, etc....

She is a diplomat and she is helping/checking up on her nation's ambassador to the city of Janarax.  She is a kick ass martial artist.  Is she black, as in American, 20th or 21st century black?  No.  Is she a person of color?  yeah, I think, I hope she is.  Her sidekick and bodyguard is white and male.  But she is no damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Her culture is one of rich, sophistication.  There is an implied economy in gems that her culture controls.  I think John (the writer) was also playing AGAINST sword and sorcery tropes were the savage jungle tribes trope is SUCH a strong trope going back to H. Rider Haggard's She and ERB's Tarzan which certainly are the precursors to Sword and Sorcery under Howard, CJ Moore, Kuttner, Moorcock, Lieber among others.<br/><br/>Her sex nor her race has EVER been commented to me.

I later came to play that character, and write about his past. Another player in the setting (incidentally, a racial activist, we later found out) had already started doing some stuff with the islands, so when it came time to fill in the details, I decided he was born on the island of Benay Loa, and detailed out his past, and how he came to be one of the most powerful men in the Empire. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point here is that 'generic white fantasy' stopped being generic white fantasy just because one person (a short Italian man, if it matters) decided to make a character non-white.

This is probably my favorite thing about Shadow of Yesterday.<br/><br/>A game that gives one culture a very thorough treatment, and makes that matter in play, is also fun.  This is probably my favorite thing about How We Came to Live Here.<br/><br/>I don't really care what <i>specifically</i> these cultures look like (though hopefully it's something distinct and memorable).  Drawing on real-world associations can be helpful for inter-player communication, or it can be distracting.<br/><br/>Gamebooks that fill up pages with cultures that are bland or old hat are wasting pages, IMO.  But they still may have great mechanics or monsters or other stuff to offer.  I know I look at rules over cultures when deciding whether to play a game...<br/><br/><b>Address race if you want to</b><br/><br/>I've never roleplayed with the intent to "address race" in a way that's relevant to my real-world experience.  But I could see the right pitch convincing me to give it a shot.  <br/><br/>If I <i>was</i> looking to do this, it'd be nice if I had some nice game options to choose from.<br/><br/>Incidentally addressing culture clash happens all the time in my play, but in my experience, such moments are just stages for us to say what we already think.  If playing a 15th century Iroquois character happens to be the balance-tipper that makes some player go research 15th century Iroquois life, then more power to them... though I'm still skeptical that such fact-finding is going to turn them into a more racially-enlightened person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208766/#Comment_208766" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T17:50:24+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  5:50PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>I guess what I'm not understanding is what is considered "proper" treatment of the issue of race in roleplaying games?

The second game is a more intimate roleplaying game exploring the feelings of dealing with different cultures, along with the myths and legends that define those cultures. <br/><br/>I had someone over on the forge tell me that my game was skating close to racism.<br/><br/>It's a valid concern, and something that I've really been worried about. Are my explorations of the world's cultures merely an attempt to stereotype them? <br/><br/>It would be easy to ignore if I was creating a fantasy world. I could really exaggerate certain angles, and then when people take offence I could easily say "Get a life, it's only a fucking game", but when I'm mirroring the real world it becomes a little harder to distance.<br/><br/>Heretics within the Islamic extremists dealing with djinni.<br/>Fundamentalist Christians (or Mormons) calling on Angels to smite those they consider wicked.  <br/>Neo-pagans calling on the powers of ancient and immortal fey.<br/>Voodounistas gathering the pieces of a half-dozen religions to craft some of the most potent charms in the world.<br/>Technofetishists trying to push the envelope through science and technology.<br/>All trying to shape the world in their image; while preventing other factions from gaining too much power.<br/><br/>And our poor players stuck in the middle, constantly questioning their moral values while trying to determine which cultural group are the good guys in a given situation.<br/><br/>It's a world of grey morality, and personally I'm at the point where this reflection of the world is reasonably accurate. I'm just trying to present the facts as I see them, offer the questions that I feel everyone needs to face once in a while, and leave the answers for the players to resolve among themselves. <br/><br/>I'm also trying to open up the creative potential of the world to as many people as possible, to prevent the world from focusing too strongly on the bias of my perspective. It's not that I don't have a strong creative vision for the setting, but I'd like to set the path in motion and see where people take it. If one group of players wants to run a highly racist politically charged hatefest, then that a reflection of their characters within the setting; there are certainly enough neo-nazis in the real world to justify this type of group occurring in the game world. I probably wouldn't be interested in playing this sort of game, but the potential is there.<br/><br/>If another group of players wants to run a co-operative storyline where the members of different cultures struggle to survive against the odds of a natural disaster, then that would be just as interesting to engage (if not more so). It's probably the kind of game I'd enjoy more.<br/><br/>I'm trying to provide some interesting character aspects that transcend the stereotypes by allowing players to pick and choose from a variety of options that reflect the races and cultures of the world; religions, virtues, vices, typical skills, etc. A player could really develop a character that plays up all the stereotypes of a race, or they could mix and match to get something a bit more interesting.<br/><br/>It's something I've been thinking long and hard about. I don't think my solution is perfect, it'll always be a work in progress, but at least I'm thinking about it.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208769/#Comment_208769" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T19:47:37+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  7:47PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            bad.... bad brian!  no!  no!<br/>whew.<br/>i caught myself starting to respond to something that everyone else was ignoring, and realized that doing so would probably not actually help anything.<br/>gotta learn not to argue just because.<br/><br/>not ready to make any statements on my position on this issue.  i am, however, finding the discussion of it here pretty interesting, and it's enlightening to see the different points of view.  thanks everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208779/#Comment_208779" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T23:06:46+00:00" title="May 22, 2009 11:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2009 11:07PM by Chris Peterson.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After reading and watching lots of sci-fi "by white men, for white men", I sought out this book of sci-fi short stories by black authors: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Matter-Century-Speculative-Diaspora/dp/0446525839" rel="nofollow">"Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora"</a>.

Less homogeneity and genericness?</b><br/>Ja, as a game-smith I want to explore every possible avenue of culture that may enrich the game-play of my players.<br/><br/><b>Do you want to encourage people to design games that explore racial issues, such as privilege and discrimination</b><br/>Ja, of course! There are lots of serious fun to be had in such conflicts!<br/><br/><b>Do you want people to STOP portraying minorities with stereotypes? Is this something you've seen, and think needs to stop?</b><br/>No, I do not, actually. In my eyes all characters start out as stereotypes. If the game is made for it, they will develop into complex and believable characters as the players explore them, and engage in them. If the game is made for toying around with stereotypes, that is fine too. <br/><br/><b>However;</b> if all role-playing games are made to support a stereotype of one race, then that is tragic, and needs to be addressed by us as a community. This thread is a nice opportunity to do so. <b>Good for us!</b><br/><br/><i><b>Eric Provost:</b> I do not like the provocative writings you served us with in your second post, but still; the thread has produced nice posts, so I thank you for starting it anyway.</i> :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anji" title="Anji"><img alt="Anji" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anji">Anji</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208840/#Comment_208840" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T22:49:07+00:00" title="May 23, 2009 10:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2009 10:49PM by Anji.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>To ask it another way, is she 'generic white chick' who just happens to be dark-skinned and bald?</blockquote>\nI've always noticed when the question of race comes up in discussion, there is always this "feeling" that people that are not distinctly white, must act differently than people who are white.  <br/><br/>Or if you prefer, how does one "act black"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_208841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208841/#Comment_208841" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T23:39:15+00:00" title="May 23, 2009 11:39PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My brain is grey and sluggish.

There's this thing where we think that 'black' people have a history, a culture, norms and values that are linked to their skin tone. <br/>\n<br/>\nFact is, it ain't so. Black Americans, by and large, have their own history, culture, norms and values. Africans have their own histories, cultures, norms and values (note the plural; Africa is a pretty big continent) black people from the islands around Jamaica have their own. But all of these cultures get lumped together under the heading of 'black'. A black person from a fantasy setting might come from a culture where everyone shared the same skin tone, or they may have been intermixed with whites and share a culture with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTypically when one talks about black behaviors, one is referring to the black American sub-culture. This is because it's really the only culture that identifies itself by its skin tone. The various African nations identify with their nation, and secondly with their continent. Jamaicans identify themselves as Jamaicans. So normally the answer to how one 'acts black' is to have certain cultural earmarks common to black culture, most of which are perceived as stereotypes, negative or otherwise. Shall I list them? Or do we all have a working knowledge of the (stereo)typical behaviors of black American culture?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208852/#Comment_208852" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T07:59:58+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  7:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2009 8:02AM by Parthenia.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That may be true to an extent, but African American culture shares many of its norms and values with other African cultures of the diaspora, many of which are rooted various continentally African cultures and peoples. It is not unique to African American to identify with both skin tone and country or region of country. And it's not true that African American culture is simply rooted in skin color.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the US, while tensions and stereotypes among "black" people from all over the diaspora exist, we may still honor and identify with those cultural similarities, such as religious practices and hair grooming techniques, just to name a few.

One African exchange student that sticks out in my mind was pretty hateful toward American blacks in general, based on the treatment he received from some when he first arrived. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also didn't mean to imply that black Americans identify their culture purely on skin color. Referring back to the previous example, though.. The African in question was treated badly because he hung out with several white friends he'd made, rather than flocking with the blacks on the campus. On the flip side, I was in training with an African gentleman (whose tribe and nation I forget) who was very proud of his particular tribe and nation, but rather contemptuous of other African tribes and nations. He didn't seem (from what I saw) to feel any kinship based on continent of origin or color of skin. Of course, he was rather an arrogant sort anyway, considering he was a Heart Surgeon serving as a armored vehicle mechanic while waiting for his U.S. Citizenship, so he could become an Army officer and Army doctor, so it's quite possible his high opinion of himself skewed his opinions from the norm. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Because at first glance by the dominant culture, black is black.

Because it definitely means something, and it has a big part in the answer to the question, what does it mean to "act black"."<br/>\n<br/>\n...is an excellent point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it difficult to formulate an answer to that. The closest I can think of is somewhat like what an American accent (not to include the various accents we're mostly familiar with; Valley, Southern, Boston, etc.) sounds like. I could tell you how a 'British' accent sounds, or a Hispanic accent. An "American" accent is simply an accent that isn't British, Hispanic, Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern, etc. Acting white is the same sort of thing. Acting white is simply not displaying the typical or stereotypical traits associated with minority ethnic groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine it would be much easier for a minority to describe "acting white" than it would be for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208870/#Comment_208870" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T12:46:37+00:00" title="May 24, 2009 12:46PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's unreflective to believe that American-ness or whiteness are "unmarked" in the sense of devoid of characteristic signs: in a way, to believe that is exemplary of what it means to occupy a privileged identity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208880/#Comment_208880" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T14:26:29+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  2:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ::sigh::<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it actually read like that's what I said? I mean, really? 'cause that's not even close to what I was saying. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's the view from the inside. The things that you always see don't stand out. One more white rock in a field of quartz isn't going to catch the eye. You notice differences, not the samenesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe majority of people I know are white. The behaviors that are characteristic to them not as individuals, but representatives of an ethnicity, are the same as mine, and that other guy's. Now, when several black people come together, and certain behaviors that differ from the behaviors of the non-white around them are noticed, in a group and individually, those behaviors are marked, and over time, become associated with their sub-culture, which is associated with their ethnicity. Once that's been established, you will notice when other white people take on some of those traits. When you notice a black person missing some of those behaviors, then you might conclude that that person 'acts white'. <br/>\n<br/>\nCase in point: my work, today.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur cast:<br/>\nme, white, male, senior enlisted<br/>\nSPC S, black, female, lower enlisted<br/>\nCPT P, black, male, officer<br/>\nCPT M, black, male, officer<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, SPC S was called, in a joking manner by one of the CPTs, a 'white girl'. She does lack some of the stereotypical mannerisms associated with black Americans, but not all of them. It's quite possible that, seeing as how they are both black, the CPT saw some of those 'white' behaviors in her, whereas my only observation is that she is missing some of the typical norms of black Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has got me to thinking, so I'm going to do a possibly unwise thing. I'm going to talk to my coworkers about racial stereotypes of blacks and whites, about themselves, and about each others. I believe that there is a good enough rapport that if I approach this maturely, I can get some good insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hypothesis: Most of my black coworkers will have an easier time pointing out "white" behaviors and a harder time pointing out "black" behaviors, and vice versa. I'll get back to you with my results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208885/#Comment_208885" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-24T15:06:44+00:00" title="May 24, 2009  3:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will be interested in the outcome of your investigation, because I expect that your hypothesis is wrong to this extent: white people will be less aware of stereotypically "white" behavior than blacks are aware of stereotypically "black" behavior.

The classification by skin colour became a mental shortcut, vulnerable to all the failings therein. I see inclusion of other races as reinforcing the shortcut when what we really need are ways to get around it and latch onto more relevant details.<br/><br/>How do you bring diversity into a game without falling back on lazy assumptions like race? One way is to design multiple starting categories, such as economic status, religion, rulership structure, food production, etc. Come up with a number of subgroups within each category (e.g. food production: family agricultural, forager, nomadic herding, horticulture, high-yield industrial farming). Instead of building stereotypes for each subgroup, find the intersections between subgroups from different categories and build from there. I like to merge two subgroups to design a social group, really thinking how each issue affects the other, then make individual NPCs incorporate a third. Since there are so many combinations, you get a lot of diversity, where there are both connections and differences. Don't feel you have to use every combo, but I find that 3-4 connections to each subgroup is a good number.<br/><br/>There are already plenty of games out there that do this. I prefer ones that plan it out ahead of time, rather than trying to make it up during play (or even at the start of play), because I find that people more often resort back to stereotypes when pushed to think quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208969/#Comment_208969" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T10:49:50+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 10:49AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of being yet another white male voice in the white male din, I need to post here.

I gave in to my urge to respond, one last time, to the posts that I felt were anti-productive. I should have ignored them, but I did not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI very much want to discuss race/culture in design and play. My original stance was that the various subcultures outside of gaming were of no interest to me, hence my post where I basically said that their effect on my game design is to have no effect on my game design. As I said when I finished out my last post, there are glimmerings of value throughout this thread, and I want to see those fleshed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want cultural diversity in my game settings, though I don't much care about diversity along racial lines. When I first started on Mage Blade (the only of my games with an explicit setting) I went the typical fantasy route, and had elves dwarves and such to fill that gap. Since then, I've not gotten rid of the fantasy races, but I've scaled them back. Instead of having 3 nations of elves, 3 nations of dwarves and 3 nations of men, I have 1 nation of elves (from a specific origin) two nations of dwarves, and 6 nations of men. I don't want all those nations of men to be 'white fantasy' nations, not that I've ever thought about it in those terms. It just seems that there needs to be something.. distinct about them. I also don't want them to be thinly veiled cognates to real world cultures.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, thinking about that setting in light of recent conversations, the orc nation (not previously mentioned because it didn't feel immediately applicable) is/was a clumsy, unconscious attempt at racial issues. The orcs were a savage race, enslaved by humans over time as a means of attempting to control their depredations. Eventually, there was a slave revolt that sparked off a war, which eventually ended with the nations being called to the negotiation tables, and the orcs being given their own nation in reparation for generations of treatment that was against the codes of the over-arching society. Orcs weren't considered part of that society, therefore outside its protection, until the agreements. Obviously, this solution had some enemies. The orcs had, by and large, been slaves to the humans for so long that they had little cultural identity of their own, and suddenly, they were running their own nation. Some of the humans still felt the orcs deserved slavery or death. Others who might have been more sympathetic were angry when their lands were reduced to make a place for the orcish nation. Some of the orcs chose to join their savage brethren who hadn't been captured or enslaved, but mostly they knew they didn't belong there anymore. They were too civilized for the tribes, and too primitive for their supposed peer nations, most of whom were hostile toward them, or at best neutral. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe canon setting begins 5 years after the formation of the orcish nation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there obvious parallels to black slavery in America? Definitely. Are there also some major differences? Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the human cultures, there are divisions along the lines of how a nation 'officially' feels about the orcish nation, but they are also culturally different. The people of Arien are industrious, quiet and little given to decoration, finding expression in the minute differences in utilitarian craft styles. Their music is wordless, but rich with emotion. In the island nation of Crysse, there is a deep reverence for ocean and sky, and it's almost required that one serve in a sea-related field at some point in their life. Their art usually reflects this strong relationship with the sea, and they have a marked preference for blues, greens, greys and browns in their clothing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm rambling. Basically, I'm trying to get varied cultures without being racial about it. Are there (human) people of different skintones? Yeah, almost certainly. I figure they're scattered throughout the nations, an artifact of the globe-spanning civilization that died 500 years ago. They've had 5 centuries of a civilization that has pulled itself out of the ashes of the old. I don't figure anyone much cares what color your skin is, so much as they'd care what nation you call home, or if you're a member of one of the non-human races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209012/#Comment_209012" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T14:56:17+00:00" title="May 25, 2009  2:56PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fuck it.
