Both family and house are subjective terms. The time period, family composition, and "home location" are not predetermined. If I pitched this game, I surmise it as "basically the Sims video game turned into a story game."<br/><br/>The cadence of the game goes something like: players take turns drawing scene prompt cards and then directing scenes that reflect the prompt. (Prompt being something vague like Disaster, Violence, Joy, Tradition, etc.) You go around the table doing this until you get back to where you started. Upon that, you incrementally increase the year of each family member and continue to play. You play until you feel like quitting or you reach a pretty good fictional stopping point.<br/><br/>I played a total of three games of House of Reeds so far and here are my accounts of each:<br/><br/>The first time I encountered this game was at a Story Game meetup where I learned not only was this game developed by a fellow story gamer (the designer wasn't present) but it was free!<br/>(<a href="https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/house-of-reeds/" rel="nofollow">The Rules</a> can be found here.) We told the story of an up and coming family who inherited a strange estate in steampunk London. <br/><br/>Due to the randomization of the prompt cards, this game took a eerie and dark turn with many of us drawing the disaster, departure, or violence cards. Family members grew angry at one another until either someone passed away or left the home until it was just the teenage daughter and the strange, stoic butler. However, breaking up these stretches of darkness were twinkles of light and happiness for the family. I was pleasantly surprised at just how fun and nice the game turned out to be. You can read the entire write up of this actual play <a href="http://www.ericvulgaris.com/blog/house-of-reeds" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I loved that game so much that I went ahead and facilitated it for some friends and streamed it. Twice. Both of these games were 2 player games featuring myself and a friend.<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/CJWtNzbqyy8" rel="nofollow">The first game</a> was about a story of a foster family of an ex-adventurer who settled down and lived with his wife and a few orphans he took on. It took place in a high fantasy realm's major city. This game differed from the first game as we turned more attention and focus from loss to more about growing up and what it meant for orphans after they take off on their own. It dealt with the question "Can you ever really outrun your past?"<br/><br/><a href="https://youtu.be/VIJ7ytM3apM" rel="nofollow">The second game</a> was about a stone age tribe who dwelt in a cave system. This game differed from the previous two not only in setting, but in flavor. This game felt more about leadership over a tribe and the roles of chief and shaman. This game took on the ideas of "what is best for the tribe?" and came to a very satisfying play through and ending.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this game is a very, very satisfying game to play when you want a 1-on-1 story game as well as a good game for 4 people. The achronological setting of scenes (as long as they fall within the current year) allows for a much better experience than The Quiet Year's design and need for contempt tokens.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for taking the time to read my play through and I hope that you try out this game sometime!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tsawac" title="tsawac"><img alt="tsawac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tsawac">tsawac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449265/#Comment_449265" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-03T23:43:29+00:00" title="November  3, 2015 11:43PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote House of Reeds - thanks for posting about it, Eric, and thanks for being so enthusiastic about the game in general.<br/><br/>I'm personally reluctant to pitch it as 'Sims the storygame', even though that's not a bad first approximation of the focus of play, because I'm overfocused on theme and tone and stuff. HoR was explicitly designed as '<a href="http://18cadence.textories.com/" rel="nofollow">18 Cadence</a> the storygame', and 18 Cadence's approach to homes and families is very, very different to The Sims.<br/><br/>I mean, at its core The Sims is about a world immune from history, about the conservative American dream of home-ownership as perfect independence, about little towns where nothing ever changes - there's no new construction other than the player's, no evolution in the cultural assumptions behind social rules. Commodities and prices remain constant, you'll never lose your job and can be assured of promotion, the nature of jobs doesn't change. You only have to engage with the outside world when you choose, on your own terms; you can even turn off ageing if you want. And 18 Cadence is really focused on the opposite of that - like I talk about <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=xu3axh98nft8qm8n&amp;reviews" rel="nofollow">over on IFDB</a>, it's all about how inescapably families are shaped by the world outside, about impermanence and flux and the sadness of departure and distance.<br/><br/>You could probably play HoR in either mode, but I think (hope) its default lies more towards the 18 Cadence end of things.

I would like to play this sometime, and the two-player potential is a selling point.<br/><br/>I have some questions (for either Eric or the author):<br/><br/>* How did you go about choosing the tone cards for your game(s)? In the first writeup, it sounds like you left them all in the deck (whereas the rules suggest you only use 1-3 tone cards in the deck). Is that correct? What do you recommend?<br/><br/>* How long were your favourite scenes, and how did you prefer to play them out? The rules suggest that a player simply narrates the whole scene, but some interplay with other players seems like it could be a good thing (e.g. having players take on roles in the scene, or something along the lines of Fiasco's black and white dice).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tsawac" title="tsawac"><img alt="tsawac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tsawac">tsawac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449318/#Comment_449318" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T09:37:10+00:00" title="November  8, 2015  9:37AM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric - I'm not offended at all. What I was trying to get across there was - "Sims the storygame" is honestly a pretty great elevator pitch for HoR: it gets pretty quickly to the heart of What This Thing Does. It's just not one that I, personally, could deliver without caveats... for reasons which probably illustrate why I'm so horribly bad at elevator pitches.<br/><br/>Paul: tone cards are divided into basic cards with titles in all-caps, and flavour cards in lowercase (a wording choice I'm now having second thoughts about). I think that the only flavour cards mentioned in the write-up are Eros and Violence. The others (Progress, Move, Tradition, Departure) are basic cards - they'll be in the deck in every game. (Every unhacked game. If you want a grim march into oblivion you could just remove Progress and Arrival.)<br/><br/>The way I usually choose flavour cards is to lay them all out on the table and have players remove the ones which don't fit the theme, or which they don't feel like telling stories about. I like this because it means that everyone gets a chance to veto modes of story that they're not comfortable with - and you can kind of signal the tone you're after by what you take out. But equally, I think it'd be cool to pitch a game session with scenario plus tone cards - 'I'd like to do Galactic Zoo, eros/food/lies. Who's in?'<br/><br/>HoR is basically a narration game rather than an acting game, and I'm pretty OK with that. I've offered players the possibility of acting out scenes rather than dictating them in the past, and I've never seen them take it up. That said, if you wanted to enact scenes I'd probably expect a structure something like Microscope's: scenes exist to discover or show the answer to a question, sort of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449326/#Comment_449326" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-08T20:41:12+00:00" title="November  8, 2015  8:41PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

I agree with Sam where pitching a session with flavor cards pre-selected would be cool.<br/><br/>We definitely selected 3 cards for each of my games. I think in that first game we had Eros, Violence, and Nature. (I'm shaky on if I'm recalling correctly that Nature was the third card.) <br/><br/>We selected these cards by going around the table and removing them until 3 were left. I wasn't pleased with how long this process took and so in my 2 player games, we each selected 1 card and then compromised on the final one.<br/><br/>Hacking the deck composition wouldn't necessarily ruin the design but it could change the tone of the game. Currently there's a lot of variation in just the core + 3 flavor cards.<br/>Like with my first experience, there's no guarantee to get the more positive or uplifting cards in the first place. Increasing the amount of cards would only further dilute the chances of particular cards being chosen.<br/><br/>The length of my favorite scenes were around 2-4 minutes long. (To steal from microscope's terminology) they were always dictated scenes by the player's who's turn it was. Something I did a few times that was probably against the rules would ask a few clarifying questions about any scene. (How did this character feel about so-and-so doing X in your scene? For Y's ceremony, did she use those same evil flowers from the grove?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449378/#Comment_449378" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-10T12:38:19+00:00" title="November 10, 2015 12:38PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all wonderful stuff, but I'm still wondering how the map drawing fits into this.
