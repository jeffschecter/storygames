I use a Sony digital recorder (ICD-MS515), which I am pretty happy with.  I've had it for three years but I am only lately putting it to use in games.  Files save to a 128 MB Memory Stick (purchased separately--the unit came with an 8 MB stick); I've had up to 10-12 hours of recording on one 'stick' on SP mode (LP mode would increase the time).  The recorder uses 2 AAA batteries--there's no option for AC or a USB power source.  I've gotten into the habit of using fresh batteries for every session--and having spares handy.  I've missed portions of a few sessions when I would change batteries in midstream, so now I just prefer to put fresh ones in.  The batteries last 10-12 hours.  I make sure that the red light of the machine, indicating that it's recording, is facing me during play so that if the batteries do run out--or if the machine stops recording for some reason--I have a chance to notice.  <br/>I use a USB card reader to transfer audio files from the recorder to the computer; a USB connection is also available.  I like using the card reader because it is easier to manipulate the file.  <br/>The biggest drawback so far is that I could not figure out how to get Audacity (free editing software) to convert the Sony files created by the recorder into .mp3 files.  I wound up buying Wavepad (available via download) to use for editing and even for that I had to download a specific file so that Wavepad could do the conversion.  Wavepad itself is very good; very intuitive, but similar to Audacity I suspect.  <br/>The recorder's ability to pick up voices is excellent.  Maybe too good, as the recordings from ballrooms set up with many tables is full of background noise from the other tables.  I've been using it with the microphone setting on 'High'.  There is a 'Low' setting that I will experiment with that may cut out some of the background noise without losing players' voices at the table.  <br/>One last issue has been available memory on the computer I use to edit the files.  Audio files fill up the hard drive a lot faster than I anticipated.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90288/#Comment_90288" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T18:19:09+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  6:19PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an iRiver T30.

Lucky for me, it came with the decoding software.  Unluckily, the software is PC-only.  I got it at Best Buy for $50.  I'm relatively satisfied with the sound from the Gencon floor, but only with the files I recorded at High Quality.  The mid quality sounded like Teddy Ruxbin running low on batteries and not in a Barry White cool way.<br/><br/>I wanted to use my Palm Zire which does a great job recording (crisp sound, easy to use), but only works well recording to its internal hard drive (which means only half an hour or so of recording time).  I tested it during my Lacuna game by recording to a 2 gig SD card and it skipped audio (as if accessing the card to write cost some audio every few seconds).  I wonder if it would sound better on a 256 meg SD card, but I have the recorder now so that's moot.<br/><br/>I like the sound that the Rolemonkeys and the Game Master Show get for their AP podcasts.  I watched a bit of their Vegas After Midnight game during GenCon and they had a big mic that looked expensive.  I'm sure their stuff is tres cool but do you want to drop hundreds of bucks to record your sessions?  I sure don't.<br/><br/>I recommend getting the Sony Digital Recorder (SDR) or a mic for an MP3 player you already have.  The only drawbacks I've found are that the SDR mic picks up any time you put it down or move it... loudly.  Plus, the Sony sucks batteries like I throw down Publix tea, which is fast.<br/><br/>I'm sure Ryan Macklin will be dropping by to school us on the topic of audio recording shortly.  I swear he gets wood when he talks about "his rig".<br/><br/>So I'd like to move past the audio recording tech side and into some other things that happen when you record your game.  If you want to podcast it, you become more aware of hand waving and inaudible stuff and that can detract from the tabletop experience.  If you're just recording for your own review, be careful to keep it in context.  Your NPCs will all sound the same, any accent you try will sound like ass, and you will become hyper critical of every part of your game.  Its a touchy thing to revisit what is essentially an ephemeral experience (RPGs).  Not every player is truly comfortable being recorded.  They may say its cool, but if they seem touchy, maybe it isn't the best idea.  <br/><br/>Make sure you don't play to the mic, that destroys the mood and really breaks things in the game, changes the dynamic.  If you ever say, "For the listeners at home", you should be shot or bludgeoned.  Don't EVER use the recording to offer critiques to your group.  Jason Morningstar and I have had some interesting conversations about why Durham 3 doesn't record their sessions for their podcast.  I really respect his opinion, which I will now butcher: who are you really playing the game for?<br/><br/>I like recording my games because if I'm running the game I take pitiful notes and I make up stuff that really only exists in my head while I'm doing it.  So, if I record the session, I can give session to session some consistency.  I also have moved past the hypercritical review portion and I honestly enjoy the heck out of revisiting some game sessions.  Its kinda cool that I have captured them, even if only a pale reflection of how fun they really are in the moment.  Lastly, the lion's share of my gaming is via Skype, which is audio only (don't even try to get out your webcam, Judd).  So the recording of Skype games is pretty much money.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90363/#Comment_90363" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T08:29:21+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  8:29AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

Also, I want to make a Replay of a Tenra Bansho game session.<br/><br/>The most simple form of Replay is this: Someone (usually NOT the GM interestingly enough, but in this case it most likely will be) puts a recording device down. The group plays from beginning to end. The transcriber goes back and listens to the recording putting voices to people. Then she writes the entire thing out as if it were a screenplay.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/>GM: He doesn't appear to like that solution.<br/>Abalaxis (GM): "I don't care which school of magic you're from, you're not getting in this tower!"<br/>Flozbar: "Maybe this will change your mind", and I punch him in the face.<br/>All: [laughs]<br/>-----------------------<br/><br/>That sort of thing. The recording won't be heard by anyone but the transcriber, but it MUST be clear enough so that no player's voice is left out or unclear, otherwise the replay can not be made.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

AAA battery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91885/#Comment_91885" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T15:24:17+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  3:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with the macbook solution is that Garageband only records for so long before automatically stopping. I can't quite remember how long it is, a number of beats I think.<br/><br/>I think I started using audacity at one point and then used garage band for fiddling around with editing ideas for a podcast.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Iain                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
