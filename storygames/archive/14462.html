I have a pretty thorough list, but I thought I'd cast a net and see if I could catch anyone I missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you've played any of the previous versions of the game at any of the convention sessions I ran, or offered me any feedback / discussion on it, give me a shout (by email or this thread) so I can make sure to include you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
