Why?  Because of my experience that they are reliably satisfying.  Not risky, not avant-garde, but fun every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's one thing about formulae:  They provide <i>consensus</i> for narration ... almost <i>authority</i>, in fact.  When the young farm-boy has refused the call to adventure once, and some terrible thing happened, and then he's called a second time ... well, it's time for him to go.  Nobody questions "Hey, wouldn't he be <i>scared</i> or something?"  No, he could start out scared, but the act of indulging his cowardice, followed by further trauma, means that now he's heroic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, seriously, how does that make sense?  But that's okay.  It doesn't have to make sense, it's the formula.  We accept it because we're trained to accept it, and I think that's GREAT.  The point is to get the boy on the road to adventure, so whatever makes that believable is okay with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I think about it, the more I think that <i>pacing</i> is just a general type of formula, operating in the same way.  If the shy girl plucked up the courage to confess her love in the first scene with the new kid, well, I might be unhappy accepting that.  But if she agonizes, and moons over him, and then manages to pluck up her courage after a talk with a wise older sister ... well then, that's cool.  The pacing acts in the same way as the formula above:  it helps me to accept the end result.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are destinations that I can only enter happily after being primed by a certain type of journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this make sense, so far?  I have a little mini-sorta-rant to follow this, on landmarks and conflicts, but the stuff above seems sufficiently unintuitive that I thought I'd give people a chance to squawk "WTF?" before proceeding to use it as a foundation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97176/#Comment_97176" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T10:28:38+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 10:28AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me.

Indeed, this is the benefit of a formula:  It is a MAP ... a reduction of the vastness of the possible journeys we could take into a few explicit <i>landmarks</i> that we can use to guide our steps.  It tells us what to look at, in order to lead us step by step along the path we want to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use the farm-boy example:  We look to the mountain "Call to heroism" and we walk until we are past that, then we decide to travel toward a different peak, "Refusal of Call."  That puts us within sight of "Tragic Consequences" and we trek over that way, and then we find that we can see "The Call reiterated" off in the distance, and when we trek over toward there, and walk into a place called "Heroism" we think "Yeah, it's right that we got here.  We've done the journey."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what many good gaming systems will do is that they will hang rules on these landmarks, to make them more explicit.  They won't tell you "Yeah, okay, you gotta look at this 'Call to Heroism' thing, because it's important," but they'll say "Okay, you've been Called.  Flip your potential card sideways."  That attracts attention to the moment in a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo game systems can help us point out landmarks in the story, yes?  Explicit rules always draw attention to their objects, and drawing attention to the landmarks makes it easier for people to navigate.  That's a strong technique for getting people in synch with the formula.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot feeling the mini-rant heat, yet?  Okay, let me lay it out:  Conflicts are <b><i>very bad landmarks</i></b> for many kinds of stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shy girl trying to pluck up her courage?  That story is <i><b>very poorly served</b></i> by concentrating on conflicts.  I'm not saying that conflicts aren't <i>there</i>.  My experience is that people who want to dissect a story in terms of its conflicts can always find them.  I do not doubt for an instant that conflicts are there, part of the landscape.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's like using mountain peaks as landmarks when you're trekking through a deep forest.  In order to <i>see those landmarks</i> you have to climb up above the canopy, and take yourself almost entirely out of the forest you're travelling through, just to get your bearings.  In order to navigate the story of the shy girl by using conflicts as landmarks, you have to re-envision her embarrassed blush, and her stuttering retreat, as part of some violent throw-down between two aspects of her inner self.  You have to re-envision her talk with her older sister as the sister trying to beat sense into her against powerful opposition.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a wierd, stand-on-your-head way of looking at what's happening in such a story.  It's quite as wierd as being in a forest and <i>ignoring</i> the waterfall that you've just come upon (which would be the <i>ideal</i> landmark) in order to climb a tree and look at the mountain peaks in the distance.  It's using a hugely unintuitive set of landmarks ... and while they may well do the job, they don't make it easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet ... they're the only landmarks for which we have <i>rules-craft</i>.  Conflict resolution is very well explored territory, rules-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a <i>great</i> thing if you're trying to build a system for stories where conflicts are good landmarks.  It rocks on toast for action-adventure.  But it's a problem of having only a hammer, and seeing the whole world as full of nails, if you try to build a system where conflicts are poor landmarks.  If we wanted to hang rules on some other set of landmarks, how would that even work?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm building such a system, and I find myself <i>immensely hampered</i> by my constant temptation to build a conflict resolution system into it.  I'm increasingly certain that conflicts are the wrong landmarks to guide people into the formula of the stories I want to emulate, but I don't know how to hang rules on the <i>right landmarks</i>, or even how to identify them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's my mini-rant.

And there's a statement in that book that just sort of jumped out at me, and this summary made me think of it again. Sadly I don't have the book in front of me, so this is simply a poor paraphrase - I will get the book when I get home and correct it:<br><br>"Children eventually learn that conflict isn't the only way to make stage-drama and narrative engaging. Some adults also share this misconception."<br><br>Anyway, this rant is where my thoughts have been going for a while - I want to see more stories where there are <b>resolution systems</b> and other mechanics for things that are not conflicts, even to the extent of not having a conflict resolution system at all - as long as you have <i>something</i> to resolve.<br><br>Anyway, yeah. Our rules-craft is so focused on conflict-resolution right now (which is good) to the extent that we have very little resolution alternatives to conflict. (And at least imho, a <i>game</i> should be resolving things, and a story should have things that should be resolved, even if that thing being resolved is not a conflict at all).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97188/#Comment_97188" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T11:06:25+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 11:06AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, I'm really interested in what you're saying here.

They give each character a little constellation of landmarks, many of which are not actually conflicts in and of themselves (although they do tend to lead towards conflicts).

As much as conflict has served as a useful tool thus far, I wouldn't be surprised to see the next couple years filled with innovations that move away from conflicts as the central defining feature of play.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97219/#Comment_97219" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T12:41:21+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 12:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, you have impeccable timing.

You can boil that down as all being about different kinds of choices, each along different axis in the same game.<br/><br/>While any of those choices can be presented in the context of a conflict to put it into effect, only Challenges really call out that you must intrinsically have conflict and choices are not just about  "to engage or not", "this or that" and "what to do with stakes won" but also should be crunchy enough to let you show your Gamist legs.  A Bang about choosing, defining, escalating, negating values etc. in a character doesn't actually require any system/conflict for resolution though you can put one onto it if you like ~ it still uses 'conflict' but the conflict can be solely internal within character/player.  Similarly a Fork about what imagined reality is to be imagined/created next can be made part of conflict/system or not (e.g. in Unversalis many starting tenets are Forks and can be disputed etc. though scene framing which can also be one is an inviolable player choice once you've won bid).  However, if the Fork choices aren't "in a bit of conflict" that creates predictability.<br/><br/>I think if you don't have conflict, you need some other means of creating "suspense" and "unpredictability of what follows".  I suggest those two dynamics are important to the play experience.  Even if it's just "you don't know what value choice the character will make and it's suspenseful waiting to see the choice".   Particularly if players know each other and have played over time, if you know "oh Ted always takes it this way", you need uncertainty if Ted is successful to keep it interesting and that likely comes from conflict, no?<br/><br/>Any of that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97249/#Comment_97249" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T13:36:43+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  1:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>More specifically, I can see a process of play that is built around <i>change</i> or <i>revelation</i> of character/situation without attention being paid to conflict as such.

Mystery, for instance, works nicely when landmarked as a set of reveals ("Ah!  So Miss Scarlett had secretly been blackmailing the victim over a love-child that she'd falsely claimed to have borne him, but he discovered the fiction!"), with conflict often being nothing more than the vehicle toward such reveals.

There is a whole world of territory out there to map.<br/><br/>But part of the issue is likely that we <i>do</i> have tools, but are looking at them in the wrong way.  The carpenter's hammer keeps getting taken to war.  Look at the character sheet, and character development.  JBR brought up keys, and Jonathan has been talking about interlocking keys as a framework for story for a long time. <br/><br/>A huge loss we've suffered in our design is meaningful interaction with the world, and other characters, in character for who and what they are.  Now, I know, here lies the road to 10 hours of play for 5 minutes of fun--but it does not have to.  Think about the last time your characters got drunk together and started a brawl for no good reason, or when your character fell in love with her comrade in the midst of battle.  Or whatever happened to you.  Driving toward conflict may let that happen, but we are missing the sweet, tender spaces in between High Drama for that kind of thing to open up into.  <br/><br/>Valleys and peaks.

Players make statements about story elements (each others' characters included) and roll dice to determine if the statement is true or not.  <br/><br/>Then there's the resolution of a scene, which is my attempt to climb trees to see the mountains - and a consequence of that, I'm realizing on reflection, is that it rarely feels like What's At Stake is being resolved.

If nobody can best that card then you reveal that truth to exactly the audience that you intended (or perhaps you must reveal it to everyone, unless the intended confidant makes the effort to beat the card).  However, if another player can best the card then you reveal that truth to their character.  If the GM bests the card then the truth is revealed, but only to the audience (the real-world ones, beyond the fourth wall).  In any case, if the truth is not revealed to everybody then it is now a Secret.  A Secret cannot be revealed by the character it is about (unless they win a second reveal specifically for that purpose), but may be revealed at any time by the player who won it.<br/><br/>That's only secondarily about narration ... the thing being revealed about the character is the same in any case, because really we all <i>want</i> the reveal to happen somehow or other.

There's really no conflicts to resolve in that game, as such. There're just prompts to take up or not, at the storyteller's discretion.<br/><br/>I kind of like your notion of making the "hidden-ness" of information be at stake mechanically, but suspect that it would prove pretty unwieldy in actual play. That's some complicated firewalling, and in general I tend to think "less secrets == more awesome."<br/><br/>Here's another notion: make your character "steps" consist of at least 2 parts -- no, 3 parts -- what I want, who can give it to me, and who complicates it. Let one player define no more than 1 of the parts. The others go up for grabs or get randomized or some such.<br/><br/>I think this could give you a lot of common story structures pretty easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97352/#Comment_97352" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T17:54:38+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  5:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Tony, is that sort of thing what you are thinking about?

Non-conflict portions of the story are often left to free play, and crafting rules for them would certainly help put a proper focus for the kinds of stories you're talking about. <br/><br/>Still, I think there's a level of conflict other than character conflict that could serve lots of different stories. Players can disagree with each other over where the story is going, and character conflict might only be an incidental expression of that creative disagreement. <br/><br/>Players might, for instance, disagree about the kind of formula they're in. Is this the kind of story where the shy girl works up the courage to admit her feelings to her crush, or the kind of story where she's rejected by her crush from the outset, only to realize her feelings for her childhood best friend when he helps her through it? Maybe it's the kind of story where she discovers she doesn't swing that way at all, and asking out the cute school jock was a last-ditch effort at convincing herself and others that she's hetero. <br/><br/>I think a system something like Polaris's narrative negotiation rule might help in these situations. Or maybe participants could throw down some kind of plot twist cards (though it'll be a bitch to have plot points valid across all genres) in an effort to gain control of the narration. The way I see it, it's not only inevitable but crucial that each participant has a different idea about what the story is about and where it's going, and rules are a powerful vehicle to harness those different voices for a fun and dynamic story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97506/#Comment_97506" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T10:02:32+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 10:02AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>For instance, something I'm now considering is this:  To reveal a truth about your character, you place a card, face-up on the table.

I leave that to them to narrate.  Because of that, I'm likely to be hesitant to suddenly <i>play</i> "your left hand" as a separate character ... it's unclear whether I have that authority.  After all, I clearly <b>don't</b> have the authority to say "Hrm ... I think I'll play your whole character for a while, because I believe that you'd oppose Bob's character."<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, as a GM, I will often be hesitant to <i>play</i> a PCs emotions.  It's unclear whether I have that authority.  Would it be okay for me to say "Okay, I'm going to call a conflict of Ernie's character's <i>emotions</i> against Bob's character and his intent to free the town from slavery"?  Probably not.  But it's supposed to be clearly okay for me to say "Okay, I'm calling a conflict of Ernie's characters emotions against Ernie's intent to be rational and logical"?  It's ... fuzzy.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflicts are two players opposing intents ... but what <i>kind</i> of conflicts can be called gets interesting when you factor in the "spheres of influence" of what people are narrating for outside of conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97861/#Comment_97861" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T11:24:41+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 11:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2007 11:24AM by Gaerik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony,<br><br>Is playing another character's emotions fuzzy if there is some sort of solid indicator that this is appropriate?

I often say that the actual conflicts in play aren't as important as the choices that lead to them. In fact, the conflicts tend to be the consequences of the choices. "Do I fight?" If so, then combat. If not, then contest to avoid people who think I'm a coward now."</blockquote>\nI agree with this.  It seems to me that formulaic stories all involve the heroes making the same big choices throughout.  For instance, the hero <i>always</i> refuses the first call to adventure, but accepts the second.  This flies in the face of the 'protaginist play' we've all come to know and love, where the hero gets to make whatever choice they want to.  Could it be that following these story formulae requires that we deiberately take choices away from the players?  I think this could also lead to a better understanding of how to create and introduce Bangs, if it gets followed up.  <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lxndr</cite>I'm reading a book right now about using drama, especially improvised drama, in the classroom. And there's a statement in that book that just sort of jumped out at me, and this summary made me think of it again. Sadly I don't have the book in front of me, so this is simply a poor paraphrase - I will get the book when I get home and correct it:<br/><br/>"Children eventually learn that conflict isn't the only way to make stage-drama and narrative engaging.

Once you do that, you see how arbitrary it is to think of some events being conflicts and other events that arise from narrative tension as "not-conflicts." Conflict is a state of tension between narrative elements that is resolved (really, transformed) by events in the narrative. That's it. If you let Junior High English dominate how you're going to talk about conflict then yes, you'll devolve into "(Hu)Man Versus . . . ," you'll reflexively anthropomorphize the ". . ." and return to the violence-subtext. Since violence is a central part of the history of RPGs it is difficult to ward off that tendency, but that doesn't mean you're correct.<br/><br/>In short, it doesn't make any sense you say something is "not about conflict." It's like saying your version of water doesn't have any Hydrogen. But the folk-definition of conflict used in most RPGs (and elsewhere) is overly narrow.<br/><br/>There's an excellent reason why games are concerned about conflict: These are aspects of the narrative that can be transformed/resolved through a game system, wheras in other modes an author simply decides. There are game systems for non-conflict aspects, certainly. They're things like character height/weight/eye colour charts, character advancement and the like. Systems used to determine aspects of the environment and set-dressing also qualify. But none of these things actually cause the plot to unfold *in of themselves* (Your PC's green eyes may cause her to be treated differently, but that's the intersection between that detail and something else).<br/><br/>One thing you can do is make conflict much broader and more global, instead of instanced in typical RPG terms. This could resolve itself like Plot Coupon/quest fantasy. Pick up they things/get the conditions that you need and the global conflict is resolved. You could in fact get each player to map their own landmarks, then weave them together collaboratively. We all want to beat Sauron, but this requires a minimum of maybe 10 steps per player (it's an epic, after all). These steps are automatically achievable; the rules simply structure them.

You _technically_ can have a story without conflict, or a conflict without context, but in both cases you're going to be talking about a pretty bloodless mechanical exercise, so I definitely want both.<br/><br/>To my mind, it's easy to point to the necessity of conflict - is there more than one way the game could turn out? If yes, then there are conflicting ideas at work.  If no, then, well, I'm not entirely certain what game I'm playing.<br/><br/>But that is a very strict definition, and it ignores the fact that "conflict" is weighed down with adversarial connotations.  Consider the example Mike cites from improv - given on the context I have, I have a suspicion that they meant a much less hoity-toity definition of conflict, something more like "Either I am right and you are wrong, or I am wrong and you are right, and that is the only way it can go."  When two people come into something with different ideas, then reasonably move to a compromise, was there a conflict?  Well, yes (because there were conflicting ideas, and they were resolved) and no (because the two parties did not conflict _with each other_ to resolve this).<br/><br/>It's a pretty headache-inducing distinction, to be totally frank.  But having made it, let me toss out the question - I obviously am unclear on how conflict is being used throughout these thread, so in more concrete terms, what are we removing, and what are we leaving behind?<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS -And, for the record, if you'd asked me a week ago, I would have been adamant that conflict (by the hoity toity definition) is necessary for a game to be satisfying for the same reason it's necessary for fiction to be satisfying.  Recent observations have left me slightly less certain of that position, though I'm still pretty firmly in that camp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

from what I wanted to talk about, no.  That's dead on with what I was trying to talk about:  basically, that formula looks (to me) like a lovely set of landmarks for a reliably fun journey into soap opera.  This insight, particularly, I completely agree with ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I mean, yes, there's conflicts, but that's not what makes the formula formulaic or successful</blockquote>That's what I'm saying in terms of landmarks.  You <i>can</i> do conflicts, or super-heroics, or deep drama, or pirates, or whatever ... but they're optional.  If you want to follow the formula then what you <b><i>must</i></b> do without fail is to intertwine cliff-hanger A with the foreshadowing of sub-plot B.  Those are the things in the formula ... your indispensible landmarks for that journey.  If your rules system doesn't help direct your attention to (say) foreshadowing a coming plot-line then it's not directing your attention to the landmarks of the formula.  You may well manage to do them yourself, anyway, but that's your own effort independent of the rules-system.<br/><br/>There are a lot of formulae out there that I've never seen strongly encoded into an RPG, and I suspect that may be because the game-design tools we have restricts the kind of landmarks we can highlight ... and that, in turn, restricts the kind of formulae we can encode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98661/#Comment_98661" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T11:09:49+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 11:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>I obviously am unclear on how conflict is being used throughout these thread, so in more concrete terms, what are we removing, and what are we leaving behind?</blockquote>I'm pretty sure we're <i>adding things</i>, not leaving anything behind.  I think that there is an important role for rules that help deal with stuff that <i>isn't conflict</i> ... and I expect that they'd be liberally mixed with rules that help deal with stuff that is conflict (whether those conflict rules are deep and engaged, or as simple as "The GM decides who wins").<br/><br/>As a for-instance:  Primetime Adventures.  Jason, above, posited a formula for soap operas that has landmarks of cliff-hangers and foreshadowing.  PTAs arc of screen presence is a rule which highlights both of those things.  "Eddy, your plot is about to resolve next session, so lets get that prepped at the end of this episode.  Carol, your issue is just starting to ramp up, so we'd better start planting the seeds for that now."  That has, like, zip-point-zero to do with conflict but it's still an important set of landmarks for soap opera type stuff, and the PTA rules do a stellar job of highlighting those points.  You're unlikely to ever <i>breeze past</i> those landmarks without noticing them when playing PTA ... any more than you're likely to breeze past a fight with a dragon without noticing it when playing D&amp;D.<br/><br/>So, in concrete terms:  I'm looking to push for more exploration into rules and craft that highlight pieces of the game <i>other than</i> conflict and its resolution ... other than "Does the story do X, or Y ... how do we decide?"  Those choice points are fine, and all, but there's other important stuff that we can shine a spotlight on, and I'd like to have spotlights that can point at those parts of the stage.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98673/#Comment_98673" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T11:22:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 11:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 11:23AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited to note cross-post with Tony.<br/>\n<br/>\nRob, at the risk of stepping in between here (Tony certainly doesn't need my help), I think that the problem that Tony had with what Malcolm was saying is twofold:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) People like Tony should be the last people to be accused of conflating "conflict" with the narrow early-RPG definition of conflict as combat. Nobody's making that mistake, and it's a complete tangent to everything in the thread. You'll note that Tony uses the term "Conflict Resolution," which is in reference to RPG mechanics. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) More importantly, nobody is saying that conflict is unimportant to story. Only that if you only focus on conflict that you miss what is, perhaps, even more important. We can debate which is more important, but we can't debate whether or not Tony wants to throw out conflict or something, since he hasn't proposed anything like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nTony is talking about whether or not resolution mechanics should be the focus of a system meant to provide story. Or if, instead, something can be created to facilitate the rest of the journey, including those sorts of conflicts that current resolution systems would not handle. Not handing them in terms of resolution neccessarily - that's my point that if you have a resolution system in play, it's actually taking away player agency to create results. But instead some mechanics that might inform the other parts of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I think that we have such in many RPGs. It might just be difficult to identify these. Tony's point is, I think, that we've never thought of it much this way in terms of using whatever such mechanics might exist to promote particular sorts of stories. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually I can think of one such mechanic, Jared Sorensen's Confessional mechanic from Inspectres. It can, in fact, involve conflict, but it doesn't have to, and is about giving players agency to affect the direction of the story in terms of other player's character's descriptions and acts. And does so, likely, to create the "story pattern" of the ghostbuster-esque/reality show vibe that Jared's looking to produce. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrimitive, but possibly an example. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98691/#Comment_98691" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T12:25:34+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 12:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I'm pretty sure we're<i>adding things</i>, not leaving anything behind.  I</blockquote>\nCool, that was the part I wasn't seeing from the discussion - it seemed like the goal here was to step *away* from conflict, far enough to leave it behind, and that definitely jarred.  But so long as conflict isn't being kicked to the curb, I'm cool, all's well by me.<br/><br/>But I think that leads to me questioning the terms a little bit.  I'm going to call all this non-conflict stuff context, which absolutely suggests a primacy of conflict in the hierarchy of things, but I'll flag that as bias from the getgo.  There's a huge amount of powerful stuff that lives in the context space - humor, investment, characterization and even a certain amount of drama.  But as noted, we've got really good tools for resolving conflict, and only mediocre tools for context.  Is the solution really to develop better context tools, or would we be better served looking at how we can use those elements with the tools we have?  I mean, obviously the ideal answer is both, but I worry on the balance.<br/><br/>To take an example, when you say this person's issue is coming up, and that has nothing to do with conflict, I am not sure I concur.  That, itself, is not a conflict, certainly, but it's the fuel for conflict to come - it's what I'm going to create conflict out of.  And I don't think we disagree - where you say they're landmarks to soap opera style play, I entirely agree, but "soap opera style play" says, to me, "Interpersonal conflict driven play".  So maybe it's just a difference of emphasis, but I am left wondering if we're better served peeling conflict and [whatever] apart and strengthening them individually rather than asking what is going to provide better fuel for conflicts.<br/><br/>Er, and that said, I seriously hope I'm not saying anythign that merits a stepping between.  If I seem adversarial or in Tony's face here, I very much apologize.  This is a cool question, and I push back because I think it's fruitful, not to be a dick.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98697/#Comment_98697" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T12:38:06+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 12:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2007 12:39PM by TonyLB.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Is the solution really to develop better context tools, or would we be better served looking at how we can use those elements with the tools we have?</blockquote><b><i>My</i></b> solution (this week) is to develop new tools for stuff other than conflict.

So, I'd like to (perhaps prematurely in your scheme of things) start extrapolating principles out of the examples into the larger space.<br/><br/>Firstly, what we're talking about is kind of a <b>personal plot arc or character arc</b>, like "hero refuses call, hero accepts call, hero rises to challenge, hero gets overconfident and fails, hero comes through in the clinch" or "boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back", or "bitter character holds back from commitment, bitter character is confronted with the power of love, bitter character risks accepting love", or... well, there are lots of them, and we recognize them when we see them. <br/><br/>I might have a little barn-raising where people suggest some at some point. I have a use for them.<br/><br/>Secondly, not all of these steps are conflicts, but all the ones I can think of are <b>in some way related (or relatable) to conflicts</b>. Some are changes of personal perspective which influence what someone will get into conflicts about; some are avoidance of conflict (which tells us something about the character); some serve to prefigure the conflict; some to make the conflict, when it comes, more poignant; some give resources (or, I suppose, take away resources) which could be used in later conflicts. I'd welcome suggestions of examples that have nothing to do with conflicts whatsoever, but I can't myself come up with any offhand.<br/><br/>Third, many of them (as you've alluded to) <b>don't have unknown outcomes</b>, at least not at the meta level - the character may be unaware of the outcome, but as a story-savvy audience, we <i>know</i> that the first two sons of the king are going to fail because they were rude to the old lady/fox, and the third son will succeed because he was helpful. <br/><br/>There's no need for a resolution system for these ones. We know what's going to happen and we narrate it. Maybe the way in which we narrate it becomes significant in some way in the long term, but what we're looking at here is <i>not a conflict</i> because it's not a matter of "it could go either way". We might even say going in, "Oh, I know how this one goes." That's what makes it a formula. <br/><br/>I mean, shy girl meets attractive boy, roll dice to see if she talks to him? I don't think so. Of course she doesn't talk to him. She's Shy Girl. But maybe something about the way she doesn't talk to him, or the way her player describes the scene, becomes significant and can be reincorporated later on when she does talk to him (which, of course, she eventually does).<br/><br/>Yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98730/#Comment_98730" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:10:41+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Firstly, what we're talking about is kind of a<b>personal plot arc or character arc</b>, like ... </blockquote>Okay ... you're talking about one <i>very specific</i> style of formula, right?<br/><br/>I think this would be better served having its own thread, about just that style.

But maybe something about the way she doesn't talk to him, or the way her player describes the scene, becomes significant and can be reincorporated later on when she does talk to him (which, of course, she eventually does).</blockquote>... or, equally possible ... maybe there is never, ever, any followup from the scene.  Maybe it's simply <i>necessary</i>, not for what it contributes to later scenes, but because of its place in the formula.<br/><br/>Like ... scenes don't have to be about the process of <i>creating</i> the story.  Maybe some scenes you tell because ... well ... you know what the story is for the next little while, but it's still fun to <i>tell it</i>.<br/><br/>I find this in a fair number of story-games, actually:  Sometimes the closer you get to the climax of a story, particularly a long-running story, the more scenes there are that need to be there for the story to be satisfying, but for which every outcome is predetermined.  Most people I know freeform these ... or even <i>skip them</i> (which, personally, I don't find very satisfying).  I think it would be cool to have meaningful rules stuff still happening, so that people are still playing the game.  I just don't know that it ever needs to feed back into the fiction.  Maybe it's just rules stuff to keep the game entertaining, and the scenes spotlighted.<br/><br/>Example:  End of <i>The Princess Bride</i>:  Wesley has saved Buttercup, defeated Humperdink, all the tension is over, all the plots have been resolved ... all that remains is for the two lovers to ride off and kiss against a stunning sunset.  And yet, the movie provides a moving portrayal of just how incomplete the story would be if the book were closed, the story stopped, the last scene left off.  You need the scene.  It's part of the story.<br/><br/>Is this making any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98747/#Comment_98747" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T14:29:56+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  2:29PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, if you haven't yet played <i>Bliss Stage</i>, you need to.

I don't know where the other designers are drawing their inspiration from, but, for me, my thinking about this was spurred by the lauded-and-forgotten Marvel Universe, in which characters measured XP in "lines," which were brief sentences that recorded what happened to them.<br/><br/>The cool thing about this, in my mind, is that it doesn't really matter what happens in a given scene.  You don't have to pick out the core conflict.  You just write down what happened, either a general overview  of the scene (or other subdivision of the game experience) or a description that focuses on what was important to your character.  Since I can't talk about the <i>Donut</i> and am not sure what Emily's doing with <i>Sign In Stranger</i> right now, I'll give an example from the game I just finished a draft of:<br/><br/>In <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/mwaantaangaand/" rel="nofollow">Mwaantaangaand</a>, your character might be pursuing the Agenda: "Find my dead daughter in the underworld of Mpemba and apologize for failing to protect her."  And, in a scene about that Agenda, your character might get lost amidst the twisted streets of the City of Chalk and come to the realization that they are completely and truly alone, both physically (separated from the other members of their special ops unit) and emotionally (they have not connected with anyone since their daughter died).  So you could record "I Am Truly Alone" for that scene, marking a significant moment in the story, but one in which there may not really be a conflict.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I think this is totally possible and there are already games that are beginning to do this, though more techniques and implementation methods would totally be awesome.  Is that the kind of thing you're thinking about, Tony?  Or am I misunderstanding your overall goal here?<br/><br/>P.S.  <i>Bliss Stage</i>'s "scene labelling" technique is also a great example of this (great point, Mark!), even though that works primarily orally with the outcome of the scene only being recorded as far as its mechanical result goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98771/#Comment_98771" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T15:34:32+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  3:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I was (am?) working on for my d20 Cabbages and Kings adaptation (why yes, I am adapting a 1904 romantic comedy novel to d20, why do you ask?) was having a deck of plot cards with 1904 romantic comedy formulae on them, which would be laid out in each 'chapter' of the story to define what happens next. Long stories would have a lot of cards, short ones only a few. One would be kept in reserve to be the "end twist", since we are talking about O. Henry here.<br/><br/>So for example you'd have:<br/><br/>Mistaken Identity -&gt; Change in Financial Circumstances -&gt; Something Returns To Normalcy -&gt; Change In Target Of Affection -&gt; End Twist: A Secret Revealed as one particular story arc.<br/><br/>The good thing is that there's not that many different sorts of 'turns' in a 1904 romantic comedy.  The difficult part is that in order to reduce them to a card, I had to generalize them so much that they really didn't provide enough limitation for them to provide a lot of guidance to players - not to mention that they're highly reliant on initial setup, which also could be highly kooky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98783/#Comment_98783" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T16:48:41+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  4:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.
