I also loved it because a character - several characters, even - fit on an index card. My wandering monster table was a stack of index cards.)<br/><br/>(And GURPS lost the je ne sais quois for me, but that's a topic for a different thread.)<br/><br/>I still have the books. I think I still have all the cardboard counters from the solo-adventures. But I'm not sure I want to play it again. The setting was pretty bland. Unfocused, beige fantasy. And it was essentially a board game. <br/><br/>Could it be reclaimed? Could its tactical combat live in harmony with today's cutting edge RPG design thought? How would you do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322902/#Comment_322902" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T14:57:41+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  2:57PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's some pretty deep indie love for TFT, as I recall, though I can't quite remember who was doing all the lovin'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322912/#Comment_322912" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T15:16:34+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  3:16PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jmstar ran some for me last year, and I ended up running for some friends after that.<br/><br/>We basically played it as a run-and-gun tactical game with a little roleplaying and color in-between fight scenes.
