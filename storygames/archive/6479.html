I facilitated a game of <i>Valkyrie, <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/upgrade/" rel="nofollow">The Upgrade</a></i>, two games of <i>Business Solutions</i>, and played several large-group sessions of <i>Derek Treuer's Magical Kitchen.</i><br/><br/><i>Thou Art But A Warrior </i>is <i>great </i>and I'm going to advocate for my local group to play it as soon as possible.  We used the one-shot rules and I think a full game with four protagonists and everyone in every role will burn brighter than a pile of Christians.  <br/><br/>Kevin's weird Hamlet-in-Montana project, <i>Something is Rotten,</i> was challenging and fun and needs further baking.  But I like the cut of this youngster's jib.  I wish we'd got to see more of the skeezy meth kingpin version of Fortinbras.<br/><br/><i>The Upgrade </i>went very well - Clinton and I produced, with the capable and expert help of our production assistants Emily and Eppy.  I was surprised at the juxtaposition of genuine hilarity with truth and pathos.  I had expected genuine hilarity exclusively.  There was some hot girl-girl action, too, and catfights, mansharks, Kevin Allen Junior getting clubbed like a harp seal, and jet skis that shot fire.  Definitely the highlight of Nerdly for me.<br/><br/><i>Valkyrie</i>, a game I'm playtesting, works as written, which was more or less a huge relief.  I need to fix the numbers a bit, but they are just numbers.<br/><br/><i>Business Solutions </i>also rolled pretty solid - I had two groups going at once, and they swapped a technicians mid-week, which was fun.  It's a fun game to watch.  Both groups opted for the "eccentric" flavor (as opposed to melodramatic or slice-of-life), so it played more like media properties with "Office" in the title.  <br/><br/><i>Derek Treuer's Magical Kitchen </i>was another favorite.  It's new, a very clean design, and delicious in play.  Especially the vegan option.  My favorite scenario was "fill a bowl with grapes", which I totally won.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143453/#Comment_143453" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T05:51:08+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  5:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2008 7:45AM by Eric Provost.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I played <em>Apples to Apples</em>, two games of <em>Ten Days in Africa</em>, <em>Shogun (the one with the kewl tower)</em>, a quick game of <em>Dragons of Quin</em> with Chiv, Mark Causey's hack of TBZ, <em>Mythos Hunters Zero</em>, one full-length session of <em>Man Build Fire</em>, and had one session of <em>Derek Treuer's Magical Kitchen</em>.</p>\n<p>Naturally, all the games were totally awesome.

That was one soggy piece of work...<br/><br/>I ran 2 sessions of PTA and one of Ganakagok, and got to play Business Solutions.<br/><br/>PTA 1 was Friday night.  Series title - Unit of Worship.  The pitch session started with a sci-fi bent about folks traveling through a one way gate to another planet where aliens who had previously been gods on earth still existed.  And the gods would, after centuries without followers, compete to get these folks to worship them.<br/><br/>In play, the sci-fi aspect was about absent, except for the player who's character was a robot, jealous of folks with faith, but unable to have any himself.  We had 2 gods, a reluctant Bacchus and an ambitious god named Primus.  A scheming temple priest, a teenage runaway, and a medic who found himself useless in the presence of beings able to heal any wound.<br/><br/><br/>PTA 2 was Saturday morning.  Entitled "Tomes", it was a show about a book club that investigates the supernatural.  The episode title was "The Portrait of Dorian Gray", so you can kinda guess where that went.  It was good fun involving answering machine messages from the dead, a big reveal about a shared love interest of two of the characters, and a twisted art opening.<br/><br/>Ganakagok was Saturday night.  I subbed in for Don who went home sick with allergies, and promptly forgot the theme he had set for the game (song of ice - music and sounds heard on the ice).  Instead I ran a generic game,  and with the exception of one really weak conflict on my part, it was suitably mythic.<br/><br/>We had an elder who fought the bear god, an became one with the ice.  A whaler who fought the orca spirit to a standstill, and a hunter on a private vengeance quest to kill or become a cannibal ghoul.<br/><br/>Sunday I played BSI and repaired copiers.  It was fun, if a bit random.   We chewed the scenery alot.  Our calls took us to a bad side of town nightclub, a law firm, and a CIA front operation.  <br/><br/>The food was great, especially the cookies midway through the session Saturday night.  Huevos rancheros on Sunday morning was bot unexpected (the menu called for a cold meal) and extra yummy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143457/#Comment_143457" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T06:14:23+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  6:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Prime Time Adventures</i>, Robotech plus a 70-80s punk rock music rebellion, fascist police, zeppelins, and intelligent zombies. Remi is a great GM! Seriously, the most enjoyable game of PTA I've played in a while. We drifted the rules as needed and used the optional chase rules to great effect! There was wonderful reincorporation, role reversals, and significant character change all around. The game was very dynamic. Vegan Sharks will never die!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Mythos Hunters</i>, I would buy this game when it comes out. Great mix of traditional and story game. It's a highly cinematic version of X-Men + Delta Green vs. Cthulhu. The relationship chart, leadership / strategy rules (leader can generate free successes that anyone can use when following orders), damage track (you pretty much control when you die and are rewarded for it because the closer you get to losing your character, the more powerful you become), attribute / skills system were all wonderful. My favorite part were the zero scenes. Very much like Dogs' initiation scenes. Ooohh... I also loved how the leader assigns roles to the team after watching the zero scenes and how you are mechanically rewarded for working within the team's structure. Mark was also amazing at clearly explaining the rules, pacing everything, and working with what we all brought to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Misspent Youth</i>, I really love this game and will 100% buy it when it comes out. We sat down to playtest the game text itself rather than the specific rules. It was a grueling process but a much needed one for every game. We each took turns reading 2 pages out loud and passed the rules around. As we did so, we took notes focused on clarity, flow, communication, and expectation issues. We definitely found issues but all things that are all easily fixed and this text is simply the first draft of the ashcan version. That being said, I don't think many published games, traditional or indie, would survive unscathed going through this process. The Youthful Offender trait selection section is an absolute joy to read and use. I laughed repeatedly or was creeped out and it did a great job foreshadowing what's behind the corner. Really looking forward to this!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso played Bang and Jungle Speed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143464/#Comment_143464" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T07:09:55+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  7:09AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Battletech</i> with David, the Provosts, and Mark Causey.

Morgan) which had lobbied to have passed a No-Child-Left-Behind-like law called The Initiative for The New American. This was essentially state-sponsored eugenics. The setting was sort of either an alternate-history 1960s with high-tech, or a recapitulation of the 60s in the future. The couple of scenes we played out revolved around a Patty-Hearst-like girl played by Joshua AC Newman, who had been impregnated by her senator father who had done so for greater genetic strength (at least, that was his own internal excuse), and a golden boy played by Rachel Walton who had hit the genetic lottery and had risen from low genotypic ghettos to become a mole for The New Morality. Once he was inside, though, he changed sides but hadn't figured out a way to get out, yet. His friends didn't know and the first scene resulted in this coming out and things getting way fucked-up. The girl got briefly arrested before they all affected an escape. It was really exciting and I was sad it didn't go forward. In this game were Phil and Rachel Walton, Joshua AC Newman, Patty Kirsch, and Phil &amp; Rachel's friend whose name I'm blanking on right now (sorry).<br/><br/>For the rest of Nerdly's gaming-events, the hallmark was me getting stress-stomach-aches (but in a very very good way). I sat (mostly) quietly while a bunch of people read the text to Misspent Youth <i>extremely</i> closely and out loud and came up with a bunch of things to fix in it. They got about halfway through world and character creation before we had to stop. It was stressful but helpful. That included John Stavropolous, Nathan Herrold, Terry Romero, Kevin Allen Jr., and some people whose names I'm blanking on right now (sorry).<br/><br/>(more)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143466/#Comment_143466" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T07:14:38+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  7:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only full gaming session I got in at all of Nerdly (not counting card games) was The Upgrade. I played Eric, an out-of-shape tech support guy who hated his job and had relationship issues with his wife (played by Rachel Walton) that were very similar to ones I had with my son's mother, and expressed similar issues with meeting women (not being comfortable approaching them blind, for example). Rachel and I had a lot of fun answering the couples questionnaire, and since our characters' friends filled it out for us we injected some uncomfortable truths and manipulations in there, since it was obvious her friend who initiated the process wanted to break us up.<br/><br/>I decided that Eric, like me, hates reality TV and only went on because he'd already been signed up. I decided he thought it would be a good idea but then immediately began to regret his choice to attend. He wound up being the "lone angry voice" (well almost lone) a la the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/" rel="nofollow">Network</a>. I had about 20 minutes where I pretended to enjoy myself, then the wonderfully doofusy-yet-alluring Jason (played by Kevin Allen Jr.) walked up arm-in-arm with Rose, Eric's wife, and the facade quickly crumbled. I played the rest of the game raging against the evil of the whole process to very very little effect. I had a heartfelt moment where I confessed what a bad husband I'd been, where I confronted Rose on what she had been doing wrong (my failure to express my feelings had been one of the core problems with the relationship), and told her my plans to quit the job I hated so we could spend more time together.<br/><br/>Given the way the scene played out, at this point I'm thinking, "Well, it's a bit too obvious and easy to see they're going to get back together. Let's inject some suspense." I told Rose that I was going to vote no on the Upgrade, but I didn't want her to tell me her vote, that she could have her time and think it over. Furthering this suspense aim, later on I asked for a scene where Jason tried to get real with Rose (he had done a "real moment" once before and even though it was funny, it was also quite touching).<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, somewhere along the way I brutally knocked Jason out cold with a log-strike to the back of the head. This was especially bad because he was about to try to make up with me.<br/><br/>Anyway, I go into the vote and we close our eyes and I put both my hands out, thumbs-down, to indicate I want to keep the relationship I came to the island with. I open my eyes and see Rose has her thumb up. I had played the game up til this point with a stress-related stomach-ache and the physiological reaction I had to this was even more extreme! I felt dizzy and I didn't see anything else in the room. I walked as far from her in the room as I could be and sulked (there were several occasions where I wanted to leave the cabin because my character would've totally stormed out, but I didn't want to miss anything as an audience member).<br/><br/>It was incredible. I don't think I've ever felt such strong emotions from a game and I thank Kevin, Rachel, and everyone else for helping make it happen. It was draining and punishing and totally fucking amazingly good and fun.<br/><br/>I have many many more thoughts on this game (so does everyone who played it, the session probably ran 2-3 hours but we easily spent 5 talking about it), and this style of gaming.

Funniest old-school bits:  traps, traps, traps.  So many that I suggested that the Tomb was actually a "demo dungeon" used by a company selling traps to other dungeon makers.  Mad interior decorators.  Gygax went nutty on the colors, with one room having things of about twenty different colors, including russet, olive, scarlet, and citron.  Like we could tell color that well by torchlight...<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Capes</i> was fun, with two people who were still learning the system, and myself, whose main experience was with the playtest versions, not the final product.  We had a blast nonetheless, with some cool conflicts coming up (my favorite:  a shapeshifting villain with one of the heroes as an exemplar, and a free event conflict of "Identity Revealed").  The click-n-lock chargen was used extensively, with us creating three or four characters during play -- including Batman!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the <i>PTA</i> front, I played in the Tomes game that's already been mentioned.  Another character and mine had the same girlfriend, but knew her by two different names, which made for a fun reveal.  Coming up with the series and the summary of what had happened in the previous episodes was as much fun as actually playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was my first time playing <i>The Shab Al-Hiri Roach</i>, and I had great fun.  I chose to start unroached, but was roached at the first event, with Reverend Talley attacking me in the bathroom and forcing the roach on me.  From there, we went through the usual roachy evil.  Highlights:  an NPCs death by pimp-slap, a self-destructive character who was described as "not being allowed near the Dean with forks", a wedding(!!) that kept being interrupted by roachy fun (and thus was scheduled to happen at each of the last three events), and Regina Sutton being branded.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife Sandy had prepped a game of <i>Dead of Night</i>, but it was slotted for 11pm, and all the signed-up players decided to go to bed instead of playing.  :-(                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143477/#Comment_143477" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T08:30:02+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  8:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played/did:<br><br>Bang - A fun little card game, where despite some excellent luck my outlaw got gunned down by the sherif in brutal cold blood.

I wish we'd gotten further along but i think Rob has a lot to work with here.<br><br>I made a tasty sandwich (not a game, but very important to me none the less)<br/><br/>There were no less than three times in the course of the weekend where i though "Oh, i should show this to/ask/talk to Dave Younce." His presence was greatly missed.<br/><br/>Something is Rotten - This was the first "lets try to play the game fully" playtest and it went pretty well, i feel. We stopped after one act, not because it fell apart, but because it was apparent that it could be made more awesome by changing some things around. "Something is Rotten" is an improvisational acting game where you perform Hamlet (but set in a modern day small town in rural Montana). My players were great and really got into the story. I'll have an AP post, or at least a critique/summary of this experience soon.<br/><br/>The Upgrade - A lot has already been said here about the upgrade. It was a pretty wildly amazing experience. It brought out in me things that i've never felt in a game before. Clinton and Jason were really excellent hosts, and Eppy and Emily provided wonderful support. I didn't really know what to expect out of the game going in, and i was a little nervous to be honest. I ended up making a huge ass of myself (this was on purpose, by being a bombastic jerk-off character), and then not knowing how to temper that character into showing actual emotion. This confusion led to actual awkward pathos. It was like being in highschool again and not really knowing how to talk to girls. I was honestly nervous that rob was going to kill me, i was terrified i would get dumped and end up the big lonely jerk, and i found myself desperately desiring to make a connection with someone i've only known for a few hours. All this was made more strange by the fact the these rather strong emotions all wrapped up at a specific point when the game ended. It was like "Oh, it's ten o'clock: Rob's not the angry husband your fucking with he's a guy your friends with who you've been palling around with all weekend. Rachel isn't a toyed with object of desire that your courting in hot tubs and flame spewing jetskis, she's a pretty cool person that you've just sort of met and hopefully not really creeped out. And lastly your not that guy Eric from the first real world, you're you, so stop yelling and quit that don't give a shit attitude, it's not fooling anyone." A weird night to say the least. I would like to do more of these. It will be very interesting to see how these games influence the next wave of games people are designing. I know it will have an effect on my writing, to say the least.<br/><br/>Sunday i didn't play anything, i went on a hike in the woods. It was muddy but fun. I miss being outside and despite the weather i was really happy we got a chance to do this. It was a wonderful bonding experience. <br/><br/>Nerdly was great.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143488/#Comment_143488" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T09:30:32+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  9:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh crap, I forgot to mention In A Wicked Age! Rachel ran this with Phil, Patty, Patty's husband whose name I'm blanking on, and me (and I think that's all; if I'm forgetting someone I apologize). Emily Boss played an NPC for Rachel, a bullying guard captain. <br/><br/>The story revolved around an apothecary who made magical potions, an ambitious merchant's son, a wolf-hunter who was covered in boils thanks to the apothecary, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mononoke" rel="nofollow">Princess-Mononoke</a>-style huge-ass talking wolf who lead a normal wolf pack. I was playing Chazrad the Wolf and it was in my Best Interests to reach an accord with Man and to end the fur trade. We didn't get to finish the game because the slot was only 2 and a half hours long. It was really frustrating because it was so much fun I wanted to finish!<br/><br/>Rachel started the game by kickering with an attack by the wolf pack. Emily's NPC was a guard under-officer who was really cruel and he rounded up all the men and sent them after my pack. I went down into the town and killed all the sick and old, then dragged the merchant's son's wife out into the square in front of everyone and reasonably asked her to make her husband stop.<br/><br/>The game wound up teetering between me trying to appeal to the humans who didn't understand what I was trying to do, the hunter trying to get his revenge on the apothecary, and the apothecary trying to save his ass.

Everyone at Nerdly seemed to have a better attitude because of the chores and even seemed to volunteer for more than their share more often than I'd heard of before. I got to meet a lot of people, and I felt like I gave something back this time.<br/><br/>I played some cool board games, Battletech and ran two sessions of Mythos Hunters Zero. Every game was a blast to be in. Everything worked out for me all weekend, except for hanging out with or seeing some of the people - this is understandable, as I interacted with a lot more than I normally do!

I loved the games I did play but wasn't giving it my all.  Another night of cold, less comfortable bed was not something we were willing to endure THEN have a four hour drive and be even more sick.<br/><br/>Thanks for the well wishing.  We feel much better now.  Thanks to Nathan for the company on the way up and Rob for allowing us to not worry about getting Nathan home.  What we were there for was a great event and something we'll do every year you'll have us as long as we're healthy.<br/><br/>I played my annual AGON game and I think Davey actually won because he blew through less FATE.

That's a great idea!<br/>- Don<br/>It works really well. Definitely something that I feel the designer should be present for rather than listening to as a podcast or reading a review. Why? Because what the players say isn't as important as what the players do! You need to observe everyone's facial expressions. Where they stall. Where they get excited. Where they seem confused. Not everyone will communicate this with words. And sometimes what does end up communicated is directly connected to the last strong stimulus they experienced. For example, someone could make a character and have struggled through the first 3/4ths of it but had a blast with the last part and forget how tough it was at first. The reverse can happen, you have a great time but one specific issue paints your perceptions. It helps to be there to observe the exercise. Although it can be painful! It's also important to make note of everything that happens. Even the items you don't agree with. They are happening for a reason. It may not be happening for the reason the person describing it thinks, but there is probably something there to dig up and explore. Every problem is an opportunity. We playstormed a game where a mechanic literally made the players feel frustrated and angry. We examined why and turned that into a feature. Use it to frustrate them but then give them a resource to channel those feelings and beat down the source of their frustration and turn it into feelings of awesomeness. Rock!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143560/#Comment_143560" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T12:56:26+00:00" title="May 12, 2008 12:56PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pwned <i>Derek Treuer's Magical Kitchen</i> with my mad bacon skillz.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann" title="Jule Ann"><img alt="Jule Ann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jule%20Ann">Jule Ann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143567/#Comment_143567" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T13:28:05+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  1:28PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm relatively new to story-gaming, but I had a blast this weekend, and I'm starting to see myself thinking less along the lines of "That was pretty fun, I can see why people do this" and more along the lines of "When's the next time I can do this?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI got there too late for a formal game on Friday, but I got to play Steal-a-word before bed, which satisfied my word-game craving for the weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday morning, I played in PTA "Tomes", which was a lot of fun. In the video clip Jason posted there is a shot of us playing, and we are all laughing uncontrollably in it, which rocks because that was totally the way with most of the game. My only, very minor, complaint was that (and, this being my first PTA game, I don't know whether this is always the case with PTA, or just this incident of it) it seemed like the whole conflict mechanic was almost unnecessary. We were writing the show together, and were usually happy to agree to do whatever made the story work best. It was almost as if conflict resolution was an afterthought, like "Oh yeah, this is a game, we should have a conflict once in a while." Or maybe we were just being too agreeable, and should have pushed conflict more. I don't know. It was still great fun, and absolutely hilarious.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday afternoon, I slept, because pregnant ladies need to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday night, I played in the much-touted "The Upgrade." I gotta say, this is one of the coolest experiences I have ever had, even though that has been said about eight times already by the other players. It was easily the most immersed I have ever been in a character, and, like Rob and several others mentioned, I was surprised to notice, at the finale of the game, that I had only cared what one other character's vote was going to be, and was deliriously happy that Alessio chose me, er, Patti. And, after we stopped playing, I found myself still feeling my character's feelings, and I think I am now in love with Joshua.<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday morning, I joined in another non-game, "hike", having much enjoyed "nap" the day before. We saw a lot of mud, forded a stream without losing any of our party members, and stumbled on ancient elven village with rune-covered trees twice. Lots of fresh air and good conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all in all, I guess I didn't play all that many games this weekend. But I had fun doing everything I ended up doing, and that's what counts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143578/#Comment_143578" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T13:57:49+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  1:57PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: juleann</cite>Or maybe we were just being too agreeable, and should have pushed conflict more.

If the conflicts always seemed to have one good path for the story, then I'd struggle to find a choice that led to two enticing story paths - and struggle over that.

Actually I the reason I really wanted to do the second PTA game was because I really liked doing the read through with John and Terry and thought that they would be fun to get to actually game with. <br/>\nIm really really glad I did. The second PTA game was really the best thing I've played in a long time, but the process of going through 2 pitch sessions in such a short time was very taxing. The game was also 180 degrees from my other PTA game, which I felt had a more family oriented structure (albeit one with a dysfunctional drunk god, a runaway kid and a robot without a soul) and ended in the destruction of mankind due to our inability to tolerate or understand the need for rebellion and our desire for acceptance. Everyone in the game had some sort of major character change that really just freaked me out so many times. It made me really come out of my shell and overcome some of my shyness.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Robert... thanks for letting me participate in the eviscerating of misspent youth... I don't know why you never attacked any of us with the spork on the table behind you, but I know you wanted too. Not many people could have taken all that criticism without mass murder. Hopefully I can get someone to play it down here and I'll try to get some notes down about how it worked for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also played a card game that I cant recall the name of. Its play reminded me of "I never" which would be insanely fun to take shots too. Thanks to Shane and Amy for that one. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally Joshua A.C. Newman...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was awesome meeting you man, and Im sorry Shock never really gelled. So, I hope we can get a game going next nerdly (or before!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143597/#Comment_143597" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T15:24:42+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  3:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Maddrjeffe</cite>Also Robert... thanks for letting me participate in the eviscerating of misspent youth...

It was very fun and rather intense playing an antagonist aimed at a single person the whole time. Although Jason was awfully helpful at antagonizing himself. I really enjoy the narrative negotiating of Polaris. My favorite attempt to screw over Jason's character was in wooing his son to convert. The perfect timing for a "You ask far too much!" phrase, which we heard quite often that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday morning I played in Nick's "Burning Wheel: The Blossoms are Falling" one-shot-in-progress with Kit, Don, Phil, and Jeff. We struggled a bit to ready the characters for play and we had to cut things short, but I enjoyed the setting, and I warmed up to my character, a merciless lord, more than I thought I would. The main thrust of the story ended up being our attempts to prove the guilt or innocence of a member of our dysfunctional family who put the clan business, iron mining, in jeopardy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat afternoon, I played in Rob's "Misspent Youth" with Josh, Phil, Patty, and Jeremy. Rob did a good job of summarizing already, but I'll add that I really enjoyed what we started, and it was indeed sad to have to end it where we did. I put myself in the incredibly awkward (but fun!) position of having to explain to my friends why I wasn't really a traitor. And I was terrified that Josh's violent and pregnant Pamela (and love interest of my Adam) was going to rip me to shreds. I was actually touched when the only slapping she did was to knock the pill overdose out of his hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then...the now legendary Jeepform "The Upgrade." It's so interesting reading everyone else's comments on this. I love that everyone seemed to feel a least a thread of genuine terror at being chosen or not at the end. I had no idea what I wanted by the end - I was almost paralyzed but the apparent weight of the decision. And when I opened my eyes, I felt a weird contrast of fluttery relief from being chosen by the one I had also chosen, as well as the crushing weight of self-hatred, having so wronged a good man, my "husband," who had chosen me. Gah - it's a game, but it's so freaking human at times. Rob and Kevin were awesome. Is it so much to ask for two men?!<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, Sunday morning, I ran "In a Wicked Age" for Phil, Rob, Sean, and Patty, and Emily joined in with a major NPC. It went really well for being the last con slot when everybody's tired. I love how unique each IaWA game can be. One of the more surprising and hilarious conflicts involved the apothecarist trying to throw a boil-curing potion onto a man who was attacking him for giving him boils in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn sum: a truly fantastic weekend. I was genuinely sad to say goodbye. Dexcon seems so far away...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143605/#Comment_143605" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T16:37:26+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  4:37PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Maddrjeffe</cite><br/>I also played a card game that I cant recall the name of.

Everyone was fantastic!<br/><br/>I played the PTA game "Units of Worship" on Friday night, and it was awesome.<br/><br/>I played Shogun, War of the Ring, the 2nd Sathar War and Andy's crazy question game on Saturday night.  All very cool.<br/><br/>Sunday was 10 Days in Africa and the drive home.  Boy was I tired.<br/><br/>It all comes back to the people, for me.  I got to meet some new people and see old friends.<br/><br/>My only regret is that I didn't more RPGs.  I didn't have much initiative this year, because I left my jacket at home and was cold all weekend, so I settled for a lot of card games and board games.  <br/><br/>And, I didn't get tricked into eating any vampire candy!

(Though I have to say that despite Clinton's initial protests about having to be mean, he was very, very good at it.) And I discovered weird loophole where you don't have to make any experience rolls if you do horrible shit to your family if your family is not Muslim - which is a good thing to have discovered.<br/><br/>Contenders was tons of fun, and more serious than intended given that we hacked the setting to 'Tibetan ninjas fighting against the Chinese for the Dalai Lama'. Emily, Travis Farber, Frank, and Joshua rocked hard on that one.<br/><br/>PTA with Remi was awesome, and we had a good old-fashioned punk rock zombiepocalypse. Thumbs up to Remi for making something coherent out of wildly disparate setting creation elements.<br/><br/>Oh, and I played my first game of 1001 Nights ever, which was so funny it made us laugh until we cried at several points. (Seriously. We had a boy sell a rock to a governor that warded off tigers. Too fun.)<br/><br/>And I got in on Business Solutions Sunday morning which was very entertaining.<br/><br/>Too much fun!

Two highlights: Instead of opening with the usual Oath-swap scenes of war and wenching, I had each Hero describe how they were responsible for the death of the Hero on their right. Much hilarity ensued, and as the killing Hero had to feel bad about their actions, a bit of pathos, too. The other cool thing was kicking Cerebus's ass with music. Nathan Herrold was the wild card in this game, constantly throwing out insane, heroic suggestions. I admit, I wasn't able to keep up.<br/><br/>I made a boffer and then was horribly boffed. Loads of fun. Thanks again, Chiv! And to Joshua Newman for teaching me his 'smooth roll' technique.<br/><br/>I ran PTA: Eve of Destruction, the punk rock zombiepocalypse, using my miniseries event rules. The players were Jeff Cruz, Anna Kreider, Travis Farber, Terry Romero &amp; John Stavropolous, and each of them stepped up hardcore. Producing is easy with players of this caliber, seriously. It was a real hoot, and getting all the players to cheer "Lance Lance Lance!" for the hated head of the Defenders, who had just shot Eve the punk rock princess in the face, was the best Act 2 close I've ever gotten out of PTA.<br/><br/>I played in the excellent The Upgrade. I had a lot of fun, and the game gave me a lot to chew on, especially regarding my ability to incorporate other people's offers in a game and go with the flow.<br/><br/>I did the hike to Elfendale on Sunday. It was a lot of fun and I got to chat with a bunch of folks and be regaled with all sorts of great stories. My goodness I'm out of shape, though.

The latter was incredible, I played a dwarven warrior named "Terminus Ultrablade", and kicked over an evil altar which first shot the party with lightning (resulting in the first death), then EXPLODED IN A FIREBALL, which took me from 102 HP down to 4.<br/><br/>Saturday was kind of a blur, I remember losing at Shogun (the new one), playing assorted card games, taking a nap, playing Ostracon (the question game), and playing Star Frontiers: The Sathar Kill the Galaxy (a strategy game using the Knight Hawks space combat rules) *as* the Sathar with Frank Manna, teaming up against James, Shane and Admiral Ami.<br/><br/>The Sathar, sadly, were slaughtered. Mostly it was due to the fact that we realized space combat in Star Frontiers was incredibly boring, involving huge capital ships flying in at insane speeds... only to part right in front of their enemies and trade blows toe to toe with only minor chances to hit. A combat between 40 capital ships vs two scouts and a base should have been "a quick slaughter", but instead took an hour. After scratching our heads on that one, James kicked some spice into it by suggesting new rules, which we used.<br/><br/>Sunday, I played more Zendo, took a hike, and generally hung out and talked.<br/><br/>A great weekend, away from home and work and with friends and new people.

I nearly froze in the mornings!)<br/><br/>I ran a nostalgic "Tomb of Horrors" D&amp;D dungeon crawl on Friday Night, which was well received.  As stated before in this thread, Gygax (RIP) went nuts over the traps.  Only managed to kill one character, but oh, well... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Saturday morning, I played Burning Wheel -- Blossoms are Falling.  It was interesting, but we had to spend a lot of time working up the characters, and then I made a mistake with my character and ended up badly beaten by a tengu to get an answer that another player had already received.  <br/><br/>Saturday afternoon, I gave a little workshop on how to make Dungeons and Dragons more of a collaborative story-telling experience, and had about 4 people listening to me.  Thanks for coming out, guys!<br/><br/>At dinner Saturday night, I was the Grillmeister, cooking all the chicken and vegetables before the flames.  Really, that was a fun experience, and Chef Derek was lots of fun to have around.  Kudos to the chef!<br/><br/>And finally, on Sunday morning, I played Jason's awesome business solutions.  It's a really fun game for small groups with only 2 hours to play in.  I had a little trouble grokking the "Goat/Troublemaker" concept at first, but it all became clear in play.  <br/><br/>Looking forward to Nerdly 3!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan" title="urbanpagan"><img alt="urbanpagan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/urbanpagan/Other%20Schtuff/urbanpaganavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/urbanpagan">urbanpagan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143796/#Comment_143796" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T16:50:29+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  4:50PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see...<br/><br/>Friday I played some Apples to Apples and 10 days in Africa.  Then I walked around and talked to as many people as I could.  All at once.<br/><br/>Saturday had me knitting and watching Mona show us how to make knitting needles.  I'll love you forever for that Mona!  I giggled quitely to myself at the spaceheater in the fireplace.  (Tee hee.)  I ran a quick MLwM for Erin, Dave, Chiv and Kit.  All the rest said they had a great time but poor Kit... I wanna apologize.  You looked in physical pain the entire time.  *laugh*  I also ran the Roach for four people that had never played it before.  Good stuff!<br/><br/>Sunday... I MADE FIRE!  ...and then bent my thumbnail backwards.  (ouchie).<br/><br/>Nerdly left its mark on me.

Good times and a good introduction for a fun weekend.<br/><br/>Saturday, I played The Blossoms are Falling, in which I played the matriarch of a clan in distress over a spoiled mine.  I played Misspent Youth as a sexually confused, chubby genius working as a software engineer contractor for the Authority.  I played Shab al-Hiri Roach as a deceptive and self-destructive Assistant Professor of Anthropology, who was unnaturally drawn to forks.  Later that evening, I played Jungle-Speed for the first time - which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>Sunday, I played in Rachel's In a Wicked Age game as a conniving apothecary looking to escape punishment of past deeds while turning a sweet profit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/somelady" title="somelady"><img alt="somelady" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/somelady">somelady</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144058/#Comment_144058" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T15:42:26+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  3:42PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lessee, Friday night was a rousing session of Emergency Vet Trip, which well and truly fouled up the weekend.  <br/><br/>Saturday morning I played in the Tomes PTA game, which was neat, and quite hilarious, though I agree with Juleann that between the group we had and the situation we concocted we could have probably come to agreement without the resolution system.  <br/><br/>Saturday afternoon I ended up wandering into a Misspent Youth game, which I enjoyed quite a bit, even if I don't think I'm quite cut out for it (and Rob I'm almost done reading the draft and you should have comments tomorrow).  <br/><br/>Saturday night I was supposed to play the Upgrade, but had to go home to help with kitty.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I convinced Sean to come too, and we played In a Wicked Age which was very cool.  I played a merchant's son who eventually went out to strike a bargain with the wolves attacking the town and was all racking my brain for how to fix things when duh!
