When I announced this playtest to my group, I got more responses than I've gotten for any other game. In fact, I was worrying if the Hx rules will break with more than 4 players. But that's what playtests are for:)<br/><br/>There's definitely a lot of putative "makes the characters' lives hell" rules in the game. So it will be interesting to see how that is in play.<br/><br/>Character-success-wise, this game seems pretty gritty. Perhaps comparable to playing BW with 2-3 lifepath characters. As opposed to the Spirit of the Century "we win!" approach.<br/><br/>Honestly, my number one fear is that the different character types with nothing holding them together will lead to character (and thus story) isolation. I will be curious to see how the players adjust to the fact that they are not on the same team.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256407/#Comment_256407" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T16:35:54+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  4:35PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2010 4:36PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM moves are the things you <i>always</i> do.

Much of the structure for the MC (Fronts, moves, etc.) are really just vague guideposts to do what most GMs already do.   And that's okay- I see the value in having them, particularly for folks that don't feel confident in the GM role, but I think it's important to realize that there's nothing especially crazy about what the MC is supposed to do with all of that. <br/><br/>From what I've seen so far, the keys for the MC are to be prepared with lots of good, colorful descriptions, have a handful of simple, interesting NPCs with strong motivations waiting in the wings, and focus your moves on setting up interesting situations and creating opportunities for player characters.  And, whenever they fail rolls or otherwise give you an opening, set their world on fire.<br/><br/>One other thing that occurred to me today while talking to some of the players- if they start to wonder why they should care about each other, or get to feeling like they can just walk away from trouble, you're not giving them enough things to worry about.  Start calling on them to cough up barter to feed themselves or fill their bikes with gas and they'll start looking around for trouble that will get them paid.  Send an army of wasteland mutants over their pathetic rebar barricade and the PCs will probably become real good friends in a hurry...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell" title="noahtrammell"><img alt="noahtrammell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell">noahtrammell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256442/#Comment_256442" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-12T20:08:28+00:00" title="February 12, 2010  8:08PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've noticed running the game for the first time is that it works better if the area the game takes place in is small.

The MC's rules are a specific framework for doing what most GMs already do. I thought that was the craziest and most awesome thing about Apocalypse World because most RPGs just provide vague guideposts, which makes lots of people nervous about GMing a game, but with Apocalypse World I finished reading it and thought, "I know exactly how to run this," and it made me want to MC a game.<br/><br/>That said, I agree with your main point.

With no mechanical constraint or accountability to the players (they don't know when you're making moves), it becomes so open-ended it doesn't seem to provide any structure whatsoever. <br/><br/>The bits I can get my mind around are A) choose moves that follow logically, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> generally use moves that set up PC actions and opportunities, saving hard, direct moves for the right moment and C) that right moment is when they miss a roll or fail to act at all.  Having that really specific trigger ("oh, he missed his roll, so I should make a really mean move now") is useful.  I just wish there was more of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257903/#Comment_257903" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T12:36:04+00:00" title="February 23, 2010 12:36PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So that said, I'm really interested in hearing how other MCs have used Moves in actual play- how have you interpreted the possible moves to set things up, create opportunities, and ultimately go after the Pcs with both barrels?<br/><br/>A few that I've used have been:<br/><i>Put Someone in a Spot</i>: An angry, methed-out mechanic goes after Dizzy the Angel while Dizzy is sitting in the shit-house<br/><i>Inflict Harm</i>: Dizzy fails to make his escape, so the mechanic starts beating him with a wrench<br/><i>Announce Future Badness</i>: The sound of bike engines heard on the wind- they're circling, slowly closing in<br/><i>Cunning Attack (front move)</i>: the rival bike gang rises out of the ruins to spring their ambush when the PCs split up<br/><i>Activate Their Stuff's Downside</i>: The Driver's heavily-armored truck- stolen by the Skinner after the ambush- runs out of gas*<br/><br/>Again, in my experience it's been easiest to make my moves when the players miss rolls.

Remind them "Hey, if you try to manipulate this dude, you get an improvement circle." Hopefully the tasty carrot can lure them out of their shells.<br/><br/>Also, if they do something that would fall under a move, make them roll for it. Threaten a dude, even in an implied fashion? That's going aggro, roll hard. Do something slightly risky? That's acting under fire, roll cool. If they do it, they have to do it.<br/><br/>Also also, if they're avoiding making moves, they're not doing anything. In addition to making hard moves when they fail a roll, you get to make hard moves when you set something up and they don't do anything to stop it. You can't escape the harsh realities of Apocalypse World by sitting in your home and hiding all day. Announce Future Badness is one of my favorite MC moves.<br/><br/>In the end, remember half your job is to make their characters' lives not boring. It's not quite exactly the same thing as "get them to make lots of moves". It's also not the same as "heap unrelenting badness upon them at every opportunity". There's <i>potential</i> overlap, it's true, but too much of the latter especially will get boring on its own, too. Don't forget those intermittent rewards on top of the fuckery!

I'm talking specifically about MC moves and the broad, arbitrary way the MC is directed to use them.<br/><br/>As an example, as an MC I have 12 basic moves and (in my case) another 13 threat moves from my Fronts. They are all very broadly worded ("Announce Future Badness", "Cunning Attack") and left to my interpretation.  The players aren't supposed to know when I'm making moves or which moves I'm making, so there is very little to constrain what I do.  Despite the fact that the text tells me my work is all cut and dried and that I just need to say what I'm supposed to say, it's far from the concrete mechanical effects of the PC moves.<br/><br/>I suppose I'm also contrasting this with games like <i>Prime Time Adventures</i> or <i>3:16</i> which give the GM a limited resource for creating challenges.<br/><br/>So how have you guys used MC moves?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257964/#Comment_257964" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T20:12:44+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  8:12PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 9:01PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see two key differences in how we're reading the text, Steve.<br/><br/>You say the moves as written don't constrain you. I don't expect them to constrain me. I expect them to provoke me to say cool things to the other players. They do this constantly for me, in technicolor. The constraints you're looking for are not in the MC moves themselves. They're the in the Agenda, Principles, and in the two ways the moves are used (either to provoke player response, or a hard move when you're allowed).<br/><br/>You talk about a resource for creating challenges. But nothing in AW tells you to create challenges for the PCs. It's just not an MC job, at all. I'd go so far as to say that creating challenges (in the way one does in some other rpgs) is bad for the game.<br/><br/>There are good reasons why "create fit challenges" is <b>not</b> one of the MC jobs.

In other words, the composition and disposition of an enemy gang is determined according to the logic of the circumstances in the fiction, not according to what would make a good challenge for the PCs.<br/><br/>Second, something happens when a character faces challenge after challenge, overcoming again and again. They become a hero. (Luke makes that case pretty convincingly in Mouse Guard, I think.) Apocalypse World is not a game for emulating heroic fiction. Any notions of heroism are nothing but dim memories in Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>So, yeah. Don't create challenges. Make apocalypse world seem real. Make the PCs lives not boring.

Whether we're talking about "challenges" or opposition or conflicts or whatever, it's still up to me to push them, to unbalance their lives, and keep things "not boring", right?  To take away their stuff, to kidnap their favorite NPC, etc. I need to make moves, and I'm groping for a better understanding of how to use those moves.<br/><br/>I'm not afraid to throw the PCs against unfair odds and I'm not trying to help them become heroes.  At the same time, I have no guidelines for how big a "real" gang would be in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, or how often or hard I should roll that gang over the PCs- it's all pretty arbitrary.  I don't generally mind that in a game (I felt pretty good about it in <em>Lady Blackbird</em> for example), but in AW I have the sense that I need to rely on the mechanics of the game to make things fair and fun for the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258026/#Comment_258026" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T06:40:01+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  6:40AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2010 6:44AM by lumpley.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that Steve's question is key: "So how have you guys used MC moves?"<br/><br/>Steve, your examples are right on. I do all sorts of just those sorts of things.<br/><br/>My favorite use of "announce future badness" is the split second: "the sentry's raising the whistle to his lips, you have a split second before he blows it. What do you do?" I make that move all the time, it's a majority of my moves. It's a perfect setup move: the PC moves in response, or else she doesn't and I get to make a hard followup.<br/><br/>There was this time a session or two ago when, let's see, Vega tried to manipulate Rose (something like that) and blew the roll. I said to myself, "self, obviously my move is to separate them - but I bet they're about to do that for me." They talked for ten seconds more, had a falling out, and one of them stormed out of the room. Afterward, Vega's player (Rob Bohl) was like, "so that time I blew that roll ... what was your move? You didn't say anything." And I said "it was to separate you, and I knew you were going to do it for me, so I let you." Rob wasn't wholly satisfied with this as a game mechanic, but who cares? It was my move to make as I saw fit.<br/><br/>Aha, yeah, here's something you may find helpful, or at least liberating: your job as MC, and thus the purpose of your moves, is to make the characters' lives interesting <i>to you</i>.<br/><br/>- Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258068/#Comment_258068" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T08:55:14+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  8:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Vincent.

They're much more like compromises in Mouse Guard / BW or like complications that are tacked on to a success.  If I get a 7-9, John always lets me get what I want; they're just strings attached, and in many cases I can decide to alter my action to account for them.<br/><br/>Frex, in our session on Monday, one of my crew got shot through the throat and I used my Eye On the Door power to try to bust our way out of there.  I got a 7, so John said I could totally do that, but someone was going to chase after me and track me as I carried my crew member to the local angel.  I said, "Yeah, I'm okay with that.  I just want to get her outta here."  And then, later on, I made another roll that allowed me to lose my tail, but also rolled a 7, so John said: "You can totally lose them around this blind turn, but they're gonna get a really clear look at you and know exactly who you are, having proof you were there."  Again, I said: "Fine," but I could totally have made another choice and tried to avoid the consequences of the roll, I think.<br/><br/>Still, I'm not sure what to suggest if putting your characters through the ringer is not fun.  I know you abuse your characters in other game and have a grand old time doing it.  What is it about doing it in Apocalypse World that isn't working for you?  Do you not have interesting choices to make?  Does being desperate and driven to crazy actions not appeal to you? Do you feel like having a character die would ruin the game?  What makes those horrible consequences destructive instead of productive?  Honestly, in our game, I can't wait to watch everything fall apart for my character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258077/#Comment_258077" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T09:25:44+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  9:25AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2010 9:26AM by lumpley.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve: Yep!<br/><br/>If you find that you're making moves instinctively all the time, that's great - the list of moves is there for you when you're like "uh ... blank!" and you can just hold it there in reserve.<br/><br/>I get that it feels odd.<br/><br/>In the game there are a couple-three key mechanical ways for you as MC to constrain yourself, to disclaim fiat.

I can flail away using my weakest stats, invariably the ones my friends have highlighted, in exchange for advancement - "opening my brain to the psychic maelstrom" and not really caring when I certainly fail. I feel like the system itself is hostile, and that anything I generate in the fiction (a son, for example) is merely grist for the mill, encouraging me to not be interesting. Anything I want will come at a cost so high I constantly reassess - not engaging with the system has been far more successful than the opposite. The one thing my guy is supposed to be awesome at - healing people - is both prohibitively expensive and undercut by NPC Angels. His one cool move - his ambulance - can be taken away whenever.

I tend to push myself toward my highlighted stats as a player, so I probably mark improvement 6+ times in a session. Some players don't push quite as hard, and probably only get 3 marks or so. But improvement is steady and pretty frequent. In the other Iron Coast game, two players are buying things off the Ungiven Future lists now.<br/><br/>We're usually pretty nice to our fellow players when we highlight stats, often choosing their best or niche thing. As MC, I pick Weird or the stat that matches the moves I'm excited to see that player make. I never choose the lowest stat just because it's lowest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258534/#Comment_258534" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T13:55:07+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  1:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2010 3:55PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some of my MC moves from recent games. The ones that say "what do you do?" are moves I made as part of the flow of play. Moves that don't say that are hard moves; follow-ups to failed rolls or when my plans came together without interference.<br/><br/>I'm also including what my move immediately lead to in play.<br/><br/><b>Announce future badness:</b><br/>"The sniper adjusts his aim, tracking from you over to Amy. What do you do?"<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"Yeah, whatever. I don't give a shit about Amy. Fire away." Blam. Amy takes a .308 round through the throat. <i>Inflict harm as established.</i></span> Amy is an NPC, so of course, I'm <i>looking through crosshairs</i>. Literally this time! Ha.<br/><br/>"Crine gets into the skimmer. It's driven by this huge brute wearing a black-painted hockey mask. There are black feathers sticking out of it, like a headdress. Black feathers all over the skimmer's roll-cage, too."<br/>"The nomad tribes don't come this far West, do they?"<br/>"Never have before, no. What do you do?"<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"Back off the way I came and head down to the train station." I take quiet notice of the fact that she doesn't tell anyone about Crine and the Nomads working together, which allows one of my plans to come together without interference.</span><br/><br/>"You catch Clarion with a far-off look in her eyes. She's opened her brain, for sure. She's whispering to herself, 'We are the lantern and she is the light.' Over and over. What do you do?" (that's also <i>announce off-screen badness</i> at the same time.)<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"I grab her and try to shake her out of it."<br/>"Okay, when you touch her, you open your brain, just like that. Roll+weird."</span><br/>(That roll is kicked off because of a custom move I have from one of my threats.)<br/><br/><b>Trade Harm for Harm (as established):</b><br/>"You gun it and crash into them. They lose control and slam into a rock like boom! Your front-end is all fucked up, the breaks don't work, and you're still going like hell. You have a piece of metal sticking out of your leg (2-harm). What do you do?"<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"Shit! I try to pull myself free and roll clear."<br/>"So you're acting under fire. Roll+cool."</span><br/><br/><b>Offer an opportunity with or without a cost:</b><br/>"You sneak over to spy on Rothchild and Crine, but Miller is right there. He'll probably spot you. What do you do?"<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"Whatever, I have 3-hold Hypnotic on him anyway. I don't try to avoid him, I just want to hear what Rothchild and Crine are saying."<br/>"Miller slips over while you're spying and tries to grope you in the darkness."<br/>"Not now, you jackass."<br/>"He gets a little glassy eyed and mechanically steps away from you. Reduce your hold to 2."</span><br/><br/>"Pellet has crude metal shutters rigged on his windows, but they're wide open right now. You're not sure where that shot came from. What do you do?"<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"I make a run for it and slam the shutter closed."<br/>"So you're acting under fire. Roll+cool."<br/>"6. Fuck."<br/>"You're halfway across the room when the next shot rings out and then you're face down on the floor with your chest pounding. Blood is everywhere. 2-harm ap."</span><br/><br/><b>Make them buy:</b><br/>"I don't know," Lala says. "This is the last of my antibiotics." She eyes the fresh pack of cigs in your pocket. What do you do?<br/><br/>"Yeah, you want information and I want some clean goddamn food for a change. Get used to disappointment." What do you do?<br/><br/>"I hear you're making the Lighthouse run. I got fuel, you know."<br/><br/><b>Tell them the possible consequences and ask:</b><br/>"You can pull a bootlegger turn here and lose the drone in the twisty streets. When you turn, you'll be facing it for a second, though. It will certainly capture an image of your face. Or you can just keep on to the clinic and keep your back to it. It will follow you all the way there, though. What do you do?"<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"Crap. Yeah, I need to ditch the thing. I make the turn and it gets my image, then."</span><br/><br/><b>Put someone in a spot:</b><br/>"The black wind nomads call up from the courtyard, 'Bring forth the murderers of our brethren and we will spare your lives!' Pellet and Chack look at each other and nod. They turn on Li. Li says, 'No. No, fuck you guys! No one is handing me over to nobody. Stay the fuck back!' She brings her assault rifle around and levels it at the room in general. What do you do?"<br/><span style="color: #667788;">"This is SO not my problem. I look around for a way to slip out of here."<br/>"So you're reading a charged situation, cool. Roll+sharp."</span><br/><br/><b>Capture Someone:</b><br/>"When you get back, the fight is over. There are some dead nomads in the courtyard."<br/>"I run upstairs to Pellet's workshop. Is Li still there?"<br/>"No. Chack's body is. He's been shot in the face several times by an assault rifle. Li's gone."<br/><br/>"You step forward to finish him off, but the look in his eyes makes you hesitate. The hands of the cultists swarm over your body and drag you down into darkness." (that's a hard move after a failed roll)<br/><br/><b>Custom Threat Move: When Crine is hunting you and you're out in the open, roll+sharp:</b><br/>Player: "12. Ha! Suck it."<br/>MC: "The hunter drone passes by, oblivious, then goes into a standard search pattern over Silvertree. Looks like it's here to stay. Those things usually travel in packs, right? What do you do?" (That's also<i> announce future badness</i> and <i>announce off-screen badness</i>.

I rolled a 7-9 on my acting under fire, so I crept up on him without waking him up, BUT he was sleeping with his 5 year old daughter in his arms, so brainwashing him would risk waking her up. (a worse outcome)<br/><br/>Focus the driver was fleeing some mutant snipers. He got a 7-9 on his acting under fire, so he escaped, but took a hit to the gas tank. He could either stop and patch the tank under fire, or escape but run out of gas in the wasteland. (an ugly choice)<br/><br/>Basically, my impression is that you did whatever you wanted AND get something bad with it, or the GM lets you choose if you want success and consequences or failure. The mechanical result of a weak hit is "a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice" as well as success on your task.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258599/#Comment_258599" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T21:01:12+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  9:01PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2010 9:03PM by Steve_Segedy.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks John, those examples are both helpful and fun.  I'd be interested in seeing your longer write-up (I'm working on one of my own now), but as Jason said, don't put yourself out.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>John's GM moves don't seem arbitrary to me. One thing I like about Apocalypse World is it says exactly what the GM can do. Can the GM capture a PC? Yes, it says so. Can the GM harm a PC? Not really, but trading harm for harm is cool. And so on.</blockquote>\nYeah, I just don't see the "it says exactly what the GM can do" part.  The MC moves include "Take Away Their Stuff"- okay, so I can take away the Driver's car.  But wait, that car is part of his basic stuff, or one of his moves. Can he get it back?  Does he have to buy it, or can he just claim another car out of the wasteland at some point?  But he can also get new cars as improvements, so maybe I can just take it away.  Can I take away the Angel's Infirmary move?  What about his Angel Kit?<br/><br/>That's just an example, but my point is that there are more gray areas than not, and sorting those out can be a little challenging.  Another example that came up in our last session was about the "seize by force" move.  The player rolled really well, but the rules suggest that the Harm still goes both ways- the Skinner was driving the ambulance over a gang of bikers, and ended up taking as much Harm as he dealt (considering their armor and gang size).  It didn't seem fair and it made me wonder about cases like surprise attacks or snipers- if your enemy couldn't possibly hurt you, how could you take Harm?  The answer is an MC judging the situation and deciding how the Harm falls. It just doesn't say that in the rules.<br/><br/>Also, sure, an MC can totally just Harm a PC.  It's right there in the "Inflict Harm" move. That is, if he thinks the time is right for that move.  Right?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>You just hate it because you hate GMs.</blockquote>\nThis is true, but it's because he is himself such a good GM.  Sad really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258687/#Comment_258687" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T08:44:30+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  8:44AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it sounds to me like multiple short, clear gameplay examples in the text would really help read- and learnability for people like myself who want to get a feeling of *how* the game will work in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What is your biggest challenge running Apocalypse World? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11502/what-is-your-biggest-challenge-running-apocalypse-world/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="What is your biggest challenge running Apocalypse World? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11502/what-is-your-biggest-challenge-running-apocalypse-world/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Caesar_X, absolutely.

I think it's sound but of course only you all will be able to tell.<br/><br/>Steve, I think what's going on is that you, Jason, and probably the rest of your group aren't seeing the constraints that exist in the game. Others can see them, as they've said, but either you are somehow missing them altogether, or else you're missing them <i>as constraints</i> - you don't see how, or maybe you don't believe that, they can act as constraints on your MCing.<br/><br/>Consequently, two things: <br/><br/>First, you feel at sea. "More gray areas than not," you say. You see lots of things that maybe you can do, but you aren't confident about which of them you really can do and which of them you really can't do, and you don't see how to decide between them at any given moment. This is in contrast with John's and Graham's experiences (for instance); somehow they as MCs know exactly what to do, pretty much all the time, because the game book just tells them.<br/><br/>Second, you're inadvertently disregarding and overstepping them. Jason's experience of partial successes on his moves is that they're actually serious failures, so he's sitting on his ass where it's safe; he feels that at any moment he might lose even the little that he has. By his report, Joel's been through exactly that. This is in contrast with Jonathan's and Dylan's experiences (for instance); you can tell that for them, hits on a 7-9 build momentum and excitement, throw fun twists, and are even something to look forward to.<br/><br/>(Jason even calls it "Forge-glossary-style Force"! I don't know a game more scrupulous about preventing its GM from using Forge-glossary-style Force than Apocalypse World, and I say that in all soberness. The game does allow the players to use some Force on the MC, but I figure the MC signed up for that.)<br/><br/>Now here's an interesting thing. John and I have both tried to point the constraints out to you, and so far you've let it pass without comment. I take this to mean again that either you're somehow glossing over it altogether, or else you don't see or don't believe that what we're pointing out are, in fact, constraints.<br/><br/>Here's John:\n<blockquote>The constraints you're looking for are not in the MC moves themselves. They're the in the Agenda, Principles, and in the two ways the moves are used (either to provoke player response, or a hard move when you're allowed).</blockquote>\nAnd here's me (alas, more meandering and less to-the-point than John):\n<blockquote>There was this time a session or two ago when, let's see, Vega tried to manipulate Rose (something like that) and blew the roll. I said to myself, "self, obviously my move is to separate them - but I bet they're about to do that for me." They talked for ten seconds more, had a falling out, and one of them stormed out of the room. Afterward, Vega's player (Rob Bohl) was like, "so that time I blew that roll ... what was your move? You didn't say anything." And I said "it was to separate you, and I knew you were going to do it for me, so I let you." Rob wasn't wholly satisfied with this as a game mechanic, but who cares? It was my move to make as I saw fit.<br/><br/>Aha, yeah, here's something you may find helpful, or at least liberating: your job as MC, and thus the purpose of your moves, is to make the characters' lives interesting <em>to you</em>.</blockquote>\nAny thoughts about those points in particular?<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258724/#Comment_258724" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T10:06:11+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 10:06AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I know Steve's working up some examples and AP stuff from our game, but he has stuff going on ...

I think expanding the list of MC moves to include mechanical descriptions and examples would work better for me.<br/><br/>It's important to note that I like the game, and I really appreciate all the examples and advice from you and other playtesters- it's very helpful, and I think our next session is going to be much better.

Also, I think some guidelines for expected play would be very useful.  The book states that you need 3 or more players, but John's notes above about the maximum group size and rate of advancement are really solid.  A few other things that would be helpful: <br/>- How long should a session take?<br/>- How together do the PCs need to be, in terms of scene framing?<br/>- What's a reasonable amount of Harm for PCs to take over a session, or several sessions?<br/>- How much barter and gear should PCs be able to accumulate over a session, or several sessions?<br/><br/>Mostly these are just to set a baseline for everybody, to provide a frame of reference for how the game is supposed to be played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258780/#Comment_258780" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T12:09:07+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 12:09PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what its worth I'm pretty excited about playing again and applying what we're learning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258789/#Comment_258789" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T12:31:41+00:00" title="February 26, 2010 12:31PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>For what its worth I'm pretty excited about playing again and applying what we're learning.</blockquote>\nAgreed.

It has to do with one of my fronts called The Lighthouse, and specifically a threat inside that front (The Light). For the sake of brevity, I left out a few bits of that exchange, including how I told them that this weird golden light was shining out of Clarion's eyes. So it wasn't a "gotcha!" move when Lafferty touched her and his brain was opened. I had already announced badness loud and clear, and he decided to act anyway (see how that reveals how much he really cares about Clarion).<br/><br/>The other move, this one:<br/>"You step forward to finish him off, but the look in his eyes makes you hesitate. The hands of the cultists swarm over your body and drag you down into darkness."<br/><br/>That was a hard move made after a failed roll. That's why it doesn't say "what do you do?" immediately after. Since I missed my roll the GM's move takes its full expression right then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258797/#Comment_258797" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T13:14:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  1:14PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>Yeah, I just don't see the "it says exactly what the GM can do" part.

Like the text says: "<b>Everything you say</b>, you should do it to accomplish both of these, <b>and no other</b>.

Does he have to buy it, or can he just claim another car out of the wasteland at some point?  But he can also get new cars as improvements, so maybe I can just take it away.

If he wants it back he can get it when he advances." Is that right or am I completely missing something?<br/><br/>I think maybe your interpretation of hard moves might be a little more severe than they're meant to be. Vx has talked about AW being Firefly. What's a hard move on that show? Think of that as your baseline.

Wouldn't your interpretation be "creating fit challenges", which John's saying not to do?</blockquote>\nI also just lost a long response on exactly this point, but here's the quote from the rules that is the important dovetail with Look through Crosshairs, from the Stakes section:\n<blockquote>Stakes should be concrete, absolute, irrevocable in their consequences. People\u2019s lives \u2014 maybe not necessarily their lives or deaths, at least not every time, but every time materially significant changes to their lives. Resolving the outstanding question means that nothing can ever be the same.<br/><br/>They should also be things you\u2019re genuinely interested in finding out, not in deciding.It\u2019s the central act of discipline that MCing Apocalypse World requires: when you write a question as a stake, you\u2019re committing to not answer it yourself. You\u2019re committing to let the game\u2019s fiction\u2019s own internal logic and causality, driven by the players\u2019 characters, answer it.<br/><br/>That\u2019s the discipline and also the reward. Your control over your NPCs\u2019 fates is absolute. They\u2019re your little toys, you can do anything to them you choose. Raise them up and mow them down. Disclaiming responsibility for the two or three of them you like best is a relief. And when you write down questions you\u2019re genuinely interested in, letting the game\u2019s fiction answer them is uniquely satisfying.<br/></blockquote>\nAll NPCs are effectively allocated in one or the other of these two categories (there's actually a third in The Ungiven Future), and its the consistency of the GMs application of these principles--the discipline of applying the game text as rules, not just advice (though it is good advice) that is important to running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258818/#Comment_258818" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T14:47:25+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  2:47PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, John.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258819/#Comment_258819" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T14:48:57+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  2:48PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2010 2:49PM by Teataine.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, very cool, very illustrative thread.

It's like "Mathold and Jeffers come around, you know how you gave them the spare key to your ambulance that time, and how now you owe them 4-barter?"* "Oh shit."<br/><br/>* The MC isn't inventing this, it happened in earlier play.<br/><br/>Anyway, taking away the stuff that makes characters cool is the worst way I can think of to make their lives interesting.

The stuff in AW is always so intimately tied to the ongoing fictional moments that providing context can spiral out of control. In the AP write up I started, one of my moves required context from over a dozen separate moments of play (including, of course, player moves and nested moves), because the action/consequence chain was just that long.

But clearly there are situations in which that is exactly the right thing to do ("my ambulance now!").  So, what then?  Steve's underlying question still hasn't been answered.  Is that ambulance just gone and it's tough luck for the angel?  Should the angel have every expectation that the ambulance will be returned in some fashion?  Or is it just gone, and they get to suck it?<br/><br/>Because I can see where the ambulance going away might be 'making it real' and 'interesting for the character's life' (sincerely, like, what happens to a man who identifies so much with a material thing has to live without it--that's an age old and rich narrative vein) but not all that fun for, you know, the player (who may not want to mine that particular vein). <br/><br/>(2), how do you adjudicate this sort of situation from our game:<br/><br/>Dust Horse can do the whole Frenzy with a mob.  I'm in the court of the nomad biker king Compton and I think it would be kind of awesome to get them all riled up as leverage to use against Compton.  I have a truth I can speak to them, which seems pitch perfect.<br/><br/>But, per a previous conflict, Steve feels like the gang isn't really a mob, in part because one of the things I can do with a mob is turn them into a gang--in this case, a gang that is significantly weaker than the original gang I'd be riling up.  In other words, it doesn't seem very 'real' and I think Steve thought it less interesting, too.  I'm cool with that (but am a little disappointed), and we roll on, but is that how it is supposed to work?  It's not terribly clear.<br/><br/>Just looking at the rules, it doesn't seem like there is any clear way to resolve that and that it ends up falling to the MC to interpret as best they can.<br/><br/>This seems a pervasive issue: "making it real" and "keeping characters' lives interesting" can vary around the table (and clearly do in our game in particular).  Especially since it's not the *players* interests that are being addressed (per Vincent: "your job as MC, and thus the purpose of your moves, is to make the characters' lives interesting to you").<br/><br/>That problem only gets worse with all the emphasis on the MC making a move without seeming to make a move.  I don't feel like I have a clear connection to what interests Steve because I can't see inside the box he's designing and am explicitly not supposed to see inside that.  I feel a little cut off from him and what he is trying to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259294/#Comment_259294" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T10:32:07+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 10:32AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ian,<br/><br/>1) So, the ambulance. First, the MC doesn't take your stuff away. That's weirdly puppet-master-y. What happens is, when someone makes a move, they roll for it, and on a miss, the MC makes the hardest move they can right then in that fictional circumstance (conforming to the agenda and principles).<br/><br/>There are circumstances where "They drive off with your ambulance," would be the obvious and best hard move, so that could happen, yeah. As could, "The rocket slams into the side of the ambulance and explodes. There's fire and burning metal everywhere." Again, that shouldn't be some secret plan of the MC's to take anything away from the player. It's all action and consequences, telegraphed at every step by other MC moves (announce future badness, etc.). So, when the rocket explodes, everyone goes, "Dammit!" but they don't go, "What the <i>fuck</i>?"<br/><br/>Second, here's a motto from AW: "There are no status quos in Apocalypse World." This means that every situation, institution, condition, or circumstance is always up for grabs. The rules don't enforce anything except the consequences of the immediate action in the fiction. So, when the Blade Brothers take your van, well, you can damn well go take it back. When the rocket explodes and turns it into burning wreckage, you can try to salvage it. Or scavenge for parts and build a new one. Or steal one. Or whatever. There's no such thing as "it's just gone."<br/><br/>Also, the rules in AW are prescriptive and descriptive. That is, if you choose "get a vehicle" as an improvement option, then you get one and you detail what kind and how. Likewise, if you undertake a series of actions in the fiction that results in you getting a car, then you get a car mechanically -- no need to "buy it" with an improvement or whatever. Same goes for gangs, followers, holdings, whatever. Think of it this way: It takes 5 highlight-stat rolls to earn a new character improvement like a gang. So you can make those 5 rolls doing whatever, then buy the gang as improvement and then say how they show up in the fiction. Or, you can go out into the world and build up a gang by taking actions (and making rolls...), then you also have that gang mechanically, same as if you got them with experience.<br/><br/>I'll answer <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> in the next post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259406/#Comment_259406" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T16:37:26+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  4:37PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2010 4:44PM by John_Harper.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2) The mob. This has two parts.<br/><br/><b>First, looking through crosshairs.</b><br/>The GM is looking at this NPC, Compton, and she's like (to herself), "Compton, your shit is about to get fucked up. Kiss your ass goodbye!" But then, how? How is Compton gonna be torn down, humiliated, murdered, and buried in the poisoned ground? It's an ongoing question. And <i>then</i>, while mulling this over, a PC strolls in and is like, "You know what? I am gonna tear this fucker Compton down." Oh, the smile on the GM's face. Whew! There's a load off the mind. She has to dish out cruel fates for, what, 30 NPCs? But now, for this one, Compton, she can sit back and fly easy. Here's a friendly neighborhood PC strolling in to do it for her. Now it's time to enjoy the show.<br/><br/>So that's the main thing.<br/><br/><b>Second, the Hocus and his move.</b><br/>"When you speak the truth to a mob, roll+weird..." is what it says. It doesn't tell you what a mob is because then you'd use that instead of thinking about it in terms of your specific circumstances. Also, much like "a charged situation," a mob is a thing that can spring into being conceptually when it's named, even if you didn't think it was there already. This is a mob? Yeah... I guess it is, now. And you have truth to speak? Fuck yes it is totally a mob. Or a mob in the making -- a little pocket of mob-ness inside the crowd. And remember that first part about looking through crosshairs. <i>The GM is already trying to come up with a way to ruin Compton's life.</i> And you say you want to incite (part or all) of his gang into a mob with your truth-speaking? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.<br/><br/>This doesn't automatically violate "make Apocalypse World seem real," either, no matter what happened in a previous scene. There are no status quos in Apocalypse World. Compton having a good hold over his gang before doesn't mean he has good hold over them now. Especially not with a wild-eyed hocus shouting Truth in their faces.<br/><br/>I mean, this whole moment of Frenzy-making is, like, <i>the whole deal</i> for a Hocus. It's the very exact thing that makes his life not boring. It's the one sure-fire thing out of all the possible moments that is going to electrify the game for that player's character. It is a golden opportunity, in other words.<br/><br/>Why on Earth would that get blocked, or nitpicked, or shut-down? "Make Apocalypse World seem real" is not a tool to enforce continuity for the sake of continuity and it is especially not a tool for denying players full expression of their characters. "Make Apocalypse World seem real" means, when the Hocus decides to Frenzy the mob of the biker king, GM, step forward with your principles to wrap all that up in a nice warm blanket of interesting fictional causality so that it's cool and exciting. It's an opportunity to contribute -- to barf forth apocalyptica, to make everyone human, to respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards -- to make the player's character's life not boring.<br/><br/>Make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259427/#Comment_259427" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T17:39:12+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  5:39PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also it's a good catch, Ian.

However, understanding that the loss is intended to be temporary, pending the player doing something to change to their circumstances again, makes a <b>huge difference</b> and I think that really does transform the experience of it.  Thanks much for walking through that.<br/><br/>It's less a matter of Quinn going, "crap, no tank" and more a matter of "oh, here's where the next tank is coming from.  I'm pulling through the wreckage of bikes and car from the last fight and..." <br/><br/>And thanks for talking through the Frenzy moves--that helps clarify a lot for me in terms of how the game works.  Especially the bit about the MC looking at the NPC's as so much chaff--that gives me a much more coherent idea of how to engage the MC at the table.  Having firmly in mind that the MC is surveying the world with an eye to burning holes through it gives me something to latch onto and push on.<br/><br/>That's one of the things that feels a little missing in the way the game gets presented to me as a player; I don't necessarily have a clear idea of what the MC does.

That's a useful guideline that suggests exactly what we're talking about here- the vehicle can get messed up or stolen, and it's just a matter of fiction and some reasonable amount of resources and/or effort to put things right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259829/#Comment_259829" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T06:04:58+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  6:04AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2010 7:58AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion helped our game quite a bit. We had a good time last night and didn't have any huge problems. It helped that we all rolled pretty well.<br/><br/>I think our five-player game really does suffer, though. We each get a tiny amount of screen time. Not much happens fictionally in our two hours of play and we're all eager for more. I had a whole big thing mapped out for my guy and only got to set it in the earliest sort of motion.<br/><br/>One thing we agreed on was that the GMs role, focus and responsibilities need to be strongly called out for the players. When Ian and I explained what Steve's motivations and goals were, it was a huge revelation, because that stuff is spelled out exactly nowhere for the guys who didn't pore over the GM book. <br/><br/>Hard seems to be the highlighted trait to have - the guy with highlighted Hard got tons of rolls, and subsequent advancement, out of proportion to the rest of us, because it gets used over and over again in the same conflict instead of once and then done. Next week I'm going to suggest that we all highlight Hard for each other.<br/><br/>History does not really make sense to us (we understand how the math works but mapping that to the game seems hollow) and we're just gaming it to get more advancement at this point. At least I am!  It was used a couple of times to impact die rolls. <br/><br/>Here's a question/observation: Forming strong relationships seems suboptimal. So I've got a son, and of course Steve is pushing hard to make his life hell, and to prevent that I would need to use my resources (and screen time) to keep him in line. This is obviously interesting for Steve or he wouldn't do it, but I want to get some other thing done, so I'm like "go on, then, ruin my son while I do this other cool thing." So Steve's goal (make Dizzy's life interesting for Steve) conflicts with what I want (make Dizzy's life interesting for me). So Steve's sad that I'm not concerned about my son and I'm sad that my son is getting chewed up for no good reason.

Thoughts?</blockquote>\nHey Jason, I think this is one of the places where it makes a lot of sense to let things ride and see what happens.  I thought a little about this last night and it seems this sort of thing will probably correct itself in one way or another.  <br/><br/>For one, San Jose (your son) isn't just something between you and Steve, right?  It's an angle he's working with Montana, too.  You not taking an interest is almost sure to have fallout that will keep things churning along there.  <br/><br/>For two, regardless, you've basically handed Steve an opportunity to do whatever he wants with San Jose, so he gets a chance to fiddle with him and see where he thinks the story will take that.  Maybe San Jose comes back a mangled mess, maybe he becomes some crazy hard thistle-dealing kid on the street undercutting your drug business, or something else entirely. <br/><br/>It's Steve's move, though, and it feels like we just need to see how it plays out before we worry about the microstep of San Jose leaving the ambulance crew.  Steve might not have gotten what he expected, but he now has the chance to figure out how to switch that up into something interesting *for him* which is a big part of the fun he gets as an MC.  <br/><br/>We probably want to cultivate a little distance from the idea that the MC and the player have to be interested in exactly the same things.  That seems like it will probably lead to frustration for both us, the players, and Steve. <br/><br/>It feels all kinds of wrong to say Steve 'mishandled' the situation-he tried one thing, it didn't go quite as expected, now he gets to try another thing.  That just seems to be part of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259875/#Comment_259875" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T09:02:43+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  9:02AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough, Ian.

It's just that when they get going, the player with a solid hard stat tends to roll and keep rolling hard throughout.  Montana kicks the crap out of a rival gang and might roll two or three or four hard rolls to smash them to bits.  <br/><br/>Comparably, Dust Horse (me) is going to be looking to try a range of things--maybe trying to talk through it (Weird, for the Hocus move I have), then maybe try to find cover (Sharp), then run like mad for it (Cool), maybe end up getting in a scuffle to do that (Hard).  So, if I'm lucky, I'll roll two highlighted stats in that same big conflict.<br/><br/>This isn't just a matter of Montana having a good Hard stat--she's got a gang (which provides armor and harm) plus armor of her own, which makes Seizing by Force or Going Aggro a much more attractive option for her.  She'll probably do some serious damage and take relatively little in return.  <br/><br/>Oh, duh, it just hit me: this is totally a place where the History stuff gives us an edge.  If Montana's frightening big gang is scaring the crap out of the rest of us players, we can try to keep from getting that Hard stat highlighted, forcing her to seek other avenues if she wants to mark improvement.  <br/><br/>The player with the most history with her can also choose to engage in a little quid pro quo...this seems to take things a little out of the game world, though.  Like, me looking at Greg (Montana's player), and saying "I'll give you that hard stat just as long as you promise not to mess with Dust Horse's cult this session."  <br/><br/>If not, then the ball is in Steve's court as to whether he wants to see Montana getting bigger and bigger, threatening to swallow Berzerkely...hmmm.<br/><br/>Does this seem like the right way to be looking at history?  It seems to make the most sense when it is a record of player to player exchanges rather than character to character ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259911/#Comment_259911" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T10:27:02+00:00" title="March  3, 2010 10:27AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess starting another thread to discuss our game's issues didn't really take <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think our five-player game really does suffer, though.

That said, the goals that you and Ian set out for (kidnapping an important dude out of a fortress guarded by a large gang) seem hefty to me, and not something quickly managed with just a move or two.  Probably we should have all been clearer about that.\n<blockquote>Hard seems to be the highlighted trait to have... Next week I'm going to suggest that we all highlight Hard for each other.</blockquote>\nHonestly I think that's the wrong approach, unless you guys want to see the action move toward threats and violence (which, hey, I've got no problem there).  Gaming the system too much just seems like a poor way to get to the fun.\n<blockquote>History does not really make sense to us (we understand how the math works but mapping that to the game seems hollow) and we're just gaming it to get more advancement at this point. At least I am!  It was used a couple of times to impact die rolls.</blockquote>\nI think having the Influence move is useful for players and interesting in play.  There was a tendency to want to be able to do it from a distance, which was a question since that is one of the Hocus' special moves. In any case, again, I think gaming advancement without some level of narrative justification is just dull.\n<blockquote>Forming strong relationships seems suboptimal.... So Steve's goal (make Dizzy's life interesting for Steve) conflicts with what I want (make Dizzy's life interesting for me).

Thoughts?</blockquote>\nFor what it's worth, I wasn't sad- I got what I set out to do, which was give San Jose some personality, to make him more interesting (to everybody).  As it was, he was a mute ragdoll serving only as an emotional trigger for you guys.  Now he's a guy in the world doing things, being awesome.
