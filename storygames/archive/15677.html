No kids, no classes, the house wasn't about to fall apart or burn down, so I had some time...<br/><br/>No kids, no classes, no (significant) housework. I could get to work with the Purposeful Acts...<br/><br/>...except, no camera (I had planned to document each one) and no car (they had to be close to home, I guess).<br/><br/>Well, they didn't have to be close to home, I thought - I've got the internet! But, money's tight all over, and I didn't really have that much of an excuse not to get out on a beautiful day and DO something, rather than just give money online. So, a compromise. Two donations, two projects outside. This, I could do.<br/><br/>I decided on a concentric effort, distant to close, to spread my efforts around.<br/><br/>First, distant. It had to be something global, or at least large-scale. I give regularly at my parish, but for this I had to do something I wouldn't normally do. For me, this would be self-directed targeted giving. About an hour's research had kiboshed some of my first thoughts, but let me to water &amp; sanitation issues. Really dead-basic 'you need this to live' stuff. So, I made a $10 donation to WaterAid.org. They seemed to be the most comprehensive global water-issue group.<br/><br/>Next, closer. I'm a big fan of public libraries. A repository of information and knowledge, available free, is a good, good thing. I live in a slightly-less-wealthy part of a very wealthy (overall) small town in Boone County, Indiana. The rest of Boone County is mostly rural, and poor. We have a great library. Lebanon, the county seat, has a pretty good one, but they can always use help. Their webpage doesn't have an online donation function, so I called them up and spoke to Yvonne, who said they would gladly take a check. She also told me that donations like that are very welcome, as they allow them to do projects outside of the primary budget. Into the mail went a $10 check.<br/><br/>Third, even closer. The neighborhood I live in is bounded on the east side by a sidewalk that a lot of middle-and high-school kids use to walk home, or to nearby shops. Our street department does a very good job, but they're always stretched thin. I could use the exercise, so out I went with a big trash bag and walked up and down a half-mile stretch, picking up litter. It wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, but I did get no small amount of candy wrappers, cans and cigarette butts off the grass and walk. Next time I do that, I'm getting one of those grabby-stabby-stick things. Ow, my back. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Last, very close. My next door neighbor, a single mom with two teenage kids, has a big, sweet yellow lab.  I cleaned up the poop in her yard. Simple, effective, and having had dogs from my earliest memories on, getting a break from Poop Patrol duties is a good thing.<br/><br/>And those are the Purposeful Acts! UserClone, I have no contact info for you, so I asked McDaldno to contact you and arrange for your copies of Perfect and The Grotesque.<br/><br/>(This was fun! The challenge of thinking up these acts led to a lot of creative, investigative possibilities. 'What needs doing around here, that I can do?' is a very interesting question...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357341/#Comment_357341" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T11:23:38+00:00" title="February  2, 2012 11:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yo, UserClone,<br/><br/>I've got some game stuff to send you, in exchange for Noah's acts of purposeful good.<br/>Whisper me your email address.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357414/#Comment_357414" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T15:53:23+00:00" title="February  2, 2012  3:53PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WOW!

I find myself in the same situation as Noah D. I too need copies of Horrors and of Dreadnoughts. I have an extensive library of gaming PDF's and a large hardcopy library I am slowly liquidating; perhaps a trade could be arranged. I would also be willing to make a charitable donation, back a project of your choice on Kickstarter at a reasonable level, send funds via PayPal (since you had to pay for them originally) or any other reasonable offer. Sadly, I am home recovering from a MI and my ability to go forth and perform acts of random kindness is limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving only half of the rules for Void Vultures is like having an itch I can't reach. Josh and Ryan are OK with a backer sharing the PDF"s but can't send out additional copies due to their deal with the backers. Best way to reach me is at: drkem@indy.rr.com<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks. -- Kem                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
