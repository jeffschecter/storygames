I do heritage and wilderness living skills education, and hardly anybody knows how to tell a decent story anymore.<br/><br/>In following this idea of the 'story-band' farther into the realization of 'story-jamming', and having bought and read Graham's great book 'Play Unsafe', it has made me connect the dots in a lot of really important ways.<br/><br/>I respect that some folks play role-playing games for different purposes that you might call 'traditional'. I myself played rpgs this way in my distant youth. I now realize that what I call story-jamming, the act of collaboratively creating story for the purposes of training one's mind's-eye for storytelling, just falls into a completely different category than the vast majority of traditional role-playing and even different than a substantial amount of 'vanilla' story-gaming.<br/><br/>When you want to train for pure story-telling, one's ability to metagame, or to use the 'rules' skillfully against another, totally falls away. It then becomes more of allowing the fiction to lead you, and sharing a kind of 'single-mind' among the players. You still use the rules to guide you, I still like to have randomizing elements (dice and cards), but it creates a totally different kind of play. It feels very improv-like, but also it goes in other directions, because it accesses the well of metaphors and mythic elements that rpgs inspire.<br/><br/>I've played Primetime Adventures and In A Wicked Age mostly, in exploring all this, I look forward to getting to know Polaris and others to, to see where things can go.<br/><br/>I realize though, that this idea of 'story' vs. 'immersion' doesn't come up in my group...that we can go to the immersive place as easily as choosing to, and walking back and forth across that line to use rules, and verbally express the story, only strengthens the connection.<br/><br/>Hypnotists recognize this as a pretty common phenomenon...when you get hypnotized, you can strengthen the depth of trance by going in and out of it, each time going back you enter deeper and deeper.<br/><br/>All good story, in my mind, puts you in a hypnotic trance. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> As storytellers, you must learn to put yourself in your own trance, which requires a whole 'nother skills set.<br/><br/>Also, to experience a vivid sensory but 'imagined' trance, you must train your day-to-day acuity and awareness, something I do in my work training folks in animal tracking skills.<br/><br/>So all these things fit...no wonder our ancestors told 12 hour (or 12 day!) memorized oral epics, while deep in trance. They 'went there', using their storytelling skills.<br/><br/>I've talked about this a bunch on my blog, and I just thought I'd share it here.

Games which consist of a group of people telling a story together. No GM, no "players", no "player characters"--just storytelling.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to discuss anything related to that, if it's your cup of tea, in this thread. Otherwise, if you want to hear more, whisper me and let me know what interests you.<br/><br/>I generally prefer "rpgs", where player portray characters, but I'm also interested in the art of storytelling and how it can be improved and made into a collaborative activity through good game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
