Comics with superheroes where action scenes take a serious backseat to psycho (literally) drama. Comics that ask, "No. Seriously. What would *really* happen if somebody had these amazing superpowers." I was thinking doing superheroes with Apocalypse World would probably automatically generate that kind of story. But then I thought somebody else must have already done this, so why reinvent the wheel.<br/><br/>So. What's the RPG for this?  Champions won't do it. (All about combat and too cruncy besides.) Icons won't do it. (Too 'four-color') The latest Marvel won't do it. (All about action.) Smallville is close but I'm pretty sure, won't do it. (My understanding is that like the TV show the conflict resolution usually ends up with nothing happening - I want to play to find out what happens. I want Miracle Lad to destroy London, I want Daredevil to get his secret identity permanently outed, I want NPC superheroes to get killed in messy ways...) [EDIT: I might be coming around on Smallville...]<br/><br/>Still, somebody must have tried to make this game, right?

Sorcerer's basic "your superpowers come with severely inconvenient downsides that directly fuel them and probably ruin your life" stuff seems surprisingly reskinnable, and there are some interesting examples of it right in the book.  Some days I think it's secretly the best battle-anime RPG.\n<blockquote>(Capes doesn't sound right to me.)</blockquote>\nI've been looking for a good superhero RPG for a long time now, and nothing I've found really works for me.  I'm actually starting to think that comic-book-superheroes are actually a deceptively terrible fit for the traditional RPG mold, because many of the core features of the genre clash terribly with what we tend to expect in games-- for instance, comics supers only very rarely make permanent changes to their powersets, but in an RPG it just feels really limiting to be stuck with just your starting loadout forever.  Which is to say that I think Capes does a superb job of modeling how classic superhero stories work, at the cost of discarding tremendous amounts of agency.  There's a lot of sound and fury, but in the end very little fundamentally changes, which I think is kind of the opposite of what Jamie wants, since the stories he's name-checking are deliberate reactions to that superheroic stasis.<br/><br/>On another note, Godlike (and definitely Wild Talents) are probably out if Champions is too much crunch.

Which is to say that I think Capes does a superb job of modeling how classic superhero stories work, at the cost of discarding tremendous amounts of agency.  There's a lot of sound and fury, but in the end very little fundamentally changes, which I think is kind of the opposite of what Jamie wants, since the stories he's name-checking are deliberate reactions to that superheroic stasis."</blockquote>\nI'm not saying this is the way to go with it, but this bit of what you said immediately made me think of Dogs in the Vineyard's advancement system. From what I see on the Experience Fallout list, your character doesn't really gain new abilities, he just evolves as a character (by gaining or improving traits). Even when you choose to add traits, your power suite can very easily remain the same while your new traits and such reflect that mental and psychological trauma and change, so it isn't like you're the same character at the end of the day. Also, the intense moral grey zone in Dogs, where sometimes what feels right or just and what is good aren't necessarily the same thing, seems to match up fairly well with what Jamie is talking about.<br>Of course, there are a bajillion issues with using Dogs as is (chief in my mind is the episodic style of play - that evolving world where your secret identity gets outed or your city falls under siege doesn't really work with Dogs as written, I don't think). I just thought it would be worth pointing out how the advancement system in Dogs works quite similarly to what you described. Personally, I must agree with Sorcerer now that it's been mentioned.

This adds an interesting spin to those moments when a superhero either makes a radical costume change, or just straight-up chooses another identity-- and if you read it literally, it has interesting implications for legacy heroes straight-up possessing their successors (whatever "Robin" is, it seems to drain its young hosts dry really fast).  Or more metaphorically, opens the possibility for a hero to have multiple secret IDs, all making their own psychological demands (like recent depictions of Marvel's Moon Knight).<br><br>I think I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention Matt Wagner's Grendel here, as it is pretty much "Sorcerer reskinned as super-heroes, played straight".  It begins as basically Evil Batman (and even crosses over with Batman), but then that character's successors go crazy while assuming the identity, and by series' end it is basically accepted that "Grendel" is an honest-to-god possessing entity of some sort playing some insanely long game over the course of centuries.  Or maybe it really is just a metaphor-- after all, the only people who hear it speak are crazy, right?  It's pretty great stuff.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371920/#Comment_371920" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T10:39:50+00:00" title="April  9, 2012 10:39AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Sorcerer is really close. <br><br>A couple quibbles: I'm terrified of running it because I've seen so many threads that say, "Sorcerer didn't work for us, why not?"

So I'm skeptical that Sorcerer would satisfyingly scale up that far (caveat; I've only played like one session of Sorcerer, ever), but I don't think it'd be any less satisfying than the alternatives.  I quite like the way Hero Wars/Quest handles scaling and opposed conflicts between beings of different power levels, but it is also a really, really handwavey system, and doesn't have the moral/psychodrama stuff as thoroughly baked in as Sorcerer.\n<blockquote>Bottom line seems to be: nothing available as written is quite what I'm looking for? So hack away? Probably starting with Sorcerer?</blockquote>\nThat's my thought, but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise.   I really, really want a flexible build-your-own effects-based supers game that doesn't make my head hurt like HERO or Wild Talents, but the closest I've found is Nobilis, and I kinda think that only works if you're playing Nobilis.  \n<blockquote>Here's another question: am I weird?

I know quite a few guys in the same boat as you-- they like the superhero aesthetic, but don't actually want to be constrained by the rules of the genre.  Personally, I think the dark/tormented hero thing is pretty thoroughly played out in actual comics (largely because Alan Moore made it look so easy everyone assumed it WAS easy, and flooded the market with so very many shitty books), but I could go for it in an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371940/#Comment_371940" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T12:11:20+00:00" title="April  9, 2012 12:11PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, huh.

(My understanding is that like the TV show the conflict resolution usually ends up with nothing happening - I want to play to find out what happens. I want Miracle Lad to destroy London, I want Daredevil to get his secret identity permanently outed, I want NPC superheroes to get killed in messy ways...)</blockquote>\nAll that can and does happen in Smallville.  The conflict resolution is designed so that nothing major can happen to the PCs without them wanting to. Miracle Lad can destroy London. Daredevil can get his secret identity outed if he's an NPC, and if he's a PC, that can happen if the player wants it to (and if the player doesn't want it to happen, then it is a good perpetual conflict, until she changes her mind - why would you want to force it on a player who doesn't want it to happen?)  NPC superheroes can get killed in messy ways. Players hold ultimate jurisdiction over their PCs, that's really all. But that doesn't mean stagnation. Players are incentivized to challenge and change their characters in big ways. And conflicts still can result in forced isntances of change, they are just temporary ones without player buy-in.<br><br>If that's a deal breaker, then I wouldn't recommend hacking it, or mixing it with Marvel, since that principle is key. Otherwise, mixing it with Marvel Heroic could be a good idea (I really like the way MH has distinctions set up - but I've only read a little of MH - enough to start thinking of combo game that's a more character driven than MH but a little less intense than SmV).<br><br>If you want psychodrama or psycho-drama, it's excellent. It could do Watchmen and Powers (and Rising Stars and Authority) really well (the others I'm either not familiar with or they aren't an ensemble). It also has room for non-superhero characters, which is extra gravy if you want to explore the "what if" fully.  When you have normal people mixed in with supers, it helps hone in on those questions. It also thrives on PvP, which focuses on the dramatic, though things can get physical. This is where teh player jurisdiction over their characters really helps.<br><br>Wild Talents was a great suggestion, but not the game for you. The system is quite old school in presenting the theme. It's all visceral and gritty. <i>However</i>, the text of the book is a great read for any supers game that's not trying to carbon copy a known setting. You'll get a ton of great advice on things to think about in planning your supers world to get the setting you want.<br><br>A note on Capes, it is only presented with four color as a default. I don't think there's anything about the system that forces that style. The only catch that, since it's GMless, everyone playing needs to be on the same page to make a focused theme work. The easy thing about four color is you can add the first thing that comes to your head - a dinosaur with laser chainsaws - and not have to worry too much about ruining the setting.<br/><br/>The main premise in a very Forge style is: "Powers are fun, but do you deserve it?" That seems completely in line with your goals, but I don't think the game actually hits answering its premise extremely well. Players need to bring it for the game to work on that level. Although the game presents Heroes and Villains as a sharp divide, there's no need to stick to a black and white morality. It could do Watchmen, for example, where the patriotic heroes are nothing more than tools of the state, villains can reform and may just want to be left alone in retirement, and everyone has their own personal issues and agendas and views on morality. I think it would work great - if the players bring it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371986/#Comment_371986" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-09T15:11:12+00:00" title="April  9, 2012  3:11PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jogesh EZ</cite><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Smallville is close but I'm pretty sure, won't do it. (My understanding is that like the TV show the conflict resolution usually ends up with nothing happening - I want to play to find out what happens. I want Miracle Lad to destroy London, I want Daredevil to get his secret identity permanently outed, I want NPC superheroes to get killed in messy ways...)</blockquote>\nAll that can and does happen in Smallville.  The conflict resolution is designed so that nothing major can happen to the PCs without them wanting to. Miracle Lad can destroy London. Daredevil can get his secret identity outed if he's an NPC, and if he's a PC, that can happen if the player wants it to (and if the player doesn't want it to happen, then it is a good perpetual conflict, until she changes her mind - why would you want to force it on a player who doesn't want it to happen?)  <br/><br/>The player might be blocking because they feel its their responsibility to 'advocate' for their character within the framework of the rules. I'd probably play that way - giving up my secret identity rather than taking stress would feel like a cop-out / giving up /  not playing by the rules to a certain extent. (In a similar way, I don't think I could let a character just die in Apocalypse World without taking all four debilities first, though I know other people who say, "Yeah, this is a good death, think I'll just die." So maybe I'm broken.)<br/><br/>All that said ... huh. maybe Smallville is it.

I beg for being corrected on this if I'm wrong. But my understanding is this:<br/><br/>Sorcerer handles scale by not focusing on the scale.<br/><br/>The issue at hand isn't "do I have enough power to affect something as huge as Manhattan". The issue at hand is "how far do you go to get what you want".<br/><br/>So if what you want is to blow up Manhattan, then play focuses on the consequences of your progress toward that goal and the consequences of achieving it.<br/><br/>That's kind of the nature of the demons. They sort of auto-scale to whatever your goals are.<br/><br/>But I could totally be off base. That's just my ingorant understanding of how it works, based on not having played the game much and not having looked at the rules in a very long time. Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The flip side of the scale question is this: How do the comics handle it? How do they deal with scale issues?<br/><br/>My limited experience with comics is that they handle scale by customizing the solution to the hero. Like, it doesn't really matter what the problem is, whether it's beating up a bank robber or stopping a metropolis from being blown up. Either way, the hero has to do certain things, like facing their personal demons, or learning to work more effectively with their team, or learning to use their powers creatively, or a handful of other common themes. And as long as they do that, what they try turns out to be the right answer and they succeed. And if they don't, then there's consequences.<br/><br/>I could be wrong, but I think getting the themes and tone and morals and stuff right is way more important than scale.<br/><br/>Scale questions are for Champions. I think if you're asking scale questions, you're asking the wrong questions for what you're trying to accomplish.

In the moment, it's also incentivized by giving you most dice to roll and helping to ensure you get what you want in a conflict.<br/><br/>What the system does is incentivize the GM to find ways that are compelling for the players. Generally the focus is on putting strain on relationships over and over until someone snaps and decides that a relationship (or a value) needs to change.<br/><br/>But for something like Daredevil's secret identity? Unless the player attaches the importance of keeping a secret identity to a value or relationship, honestly it doesn't mechanically. In conflict, the bigger incentive is to resist what's going on and take stress if losing. However, the incentive is still there in telling a good story.<br/><br/>The method for that is to incorporate that into the narrative going on. Make that an element of a relationship strain. A great example would be Spidey and MJ, the secret identity was a huge strain on their relationship until he finally trusted her with the truth and changed the nature of their relationship.<br/><br/>The point of the system is it highlights those fulcrums of change without necessarily causing them to happen. It puts those things that are usually in the back of a player's head about their character onto the table. Players can trust that they aren't being put at risk of losing control by putting this on the table. Secretly, by putting it on the table it makes it more obvious to everyone when losing control and changing would be excellent for the story. Also, when the change finally does happen, the entire group has watched this strain and build up for a while, possibly over multiple sessions. Everyone gets to enjoy the big story event.<br/><br/>Truthfully, I don't think there's anything stopping the GM from outing a character outside of all of this (assuming it's not in a Value or Relationship statement), I just feel it goes against the spirit of the rules by not making it a conflict and giving the player a say. However, for things that can be resolved it's fine to push that on players harder so they can squirm for a bit. For example, in many superhero stories a minor character has discovered the hero's secret, they may even threaten to go to the press, but the status quo is rarely changed. The character ends up dying, or goes evil and gets locked up as insane, their credibility gets destroyed and no one believes them, or they end up respecting the hero and keeping quiet.<br/><br/>The main idea is to get the players on board. If you have someone playing Daredevil, talk with them and work with them to build up to exposing his secret identity. If the player has zero interest in that, then drop the idea and explore things they are interested in. One of the emergent things about Smallville is if players are grabbing hooks or meeting challenges at a level that keeps the game moving, then it's a great sign that the GM needs to explore different hooks and challenges. It was the hardest part (and still is) in getting used to running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411987/#Comment_411987" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T10:03:14+00:00" title="April 14, 2013 10:03AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SO - a year later, I've played a few supers games where I've tried to hit this and I thought I'd report on my findings. <br/><br/>We just played a second session (third, counting character creation) of superheroes-via-Sorcerer last night and honestly, it didn't work for us. Partly because we're spoiled by AW and limping our way through the conflict system was too hard to figure out. Lots of "Do I get to roll over my successes from last thing here?" and mechanical results that we didn't desire "Really? I waited until I got the drop on him and all I get is one bonus die?" and "Really? I'm an armored superhero and he's knocking me out of the combat with a pistol?" That was one of the things I was afraid of with Sorcerer, that the power levels wouldn't give us the Miracleman / Watchmen levels of super-ness we were looking for. Plus, seems like with Sorcerer, it's intended that using your demonic powers is a fundamentally inhuman act - and that underlying assumption doesn't quite fit with superhero powers.<br/><br/>I played one session of Microscope with supers, with Ben Robbins and others, where we did a cross-generational epic thing where new generations of superheroes would take on the aliases of famous superheroes of old. A bit more Spider-Man: 2099 than Watchmen, but it went really well. Microscope's starting palette allowed us to really clearly define what we were looking for in the game: 'no silly/gonzo supers' (no Catcus Man, who can shoot spines like a Cactus!, etc) and 'no supervillains' and 'all superpowers come from the same source' really helped define the world. <br/><br/>And I also played a season of straight-up Monsterhearts where my Infernal decided he wanted to use his demon power to fight crime - and sometimes the werewolf would play along. Not postmodern superheroes as such, but it felt like it would make a great graphic novel in the Vertigo line...<br/><br/>I've suggested Smallville to a couple different groups with no luck. It's a hard sell. People who haven't tried it are put off by the TV show, and people who have already tried it say they don't like rolling so many dice to have nothing happen. <br/><br/>Is there a good AW superhero hack out there yet?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411990/#Comment_411990" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T10:19:51+00:00" title="April 14, 2013 10:19AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If your group would play Smallville with the serial numbers filed off, MWP is in the process of releasing Cortex+ Drama...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412001/#Comment_412001" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T16:14:19+00:00" title="April 14, 2013  4:14PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually had the thought that <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> would be a great spin on Iron Age capes.

The aim is to continually pressure them, to ask "when do you cross the line?", which to me was the most interesting part of Watchmen.

Locations, scenery, style of dialogue, costumes, hero names, stuff like that.  Thinking a little deeper, I go to the setting -- how does the world respond to supers?  I'm already getting into stuff that's mostly my personal taste, and I'd be going even farther in that direction if I continued.<br/><br/>So, I'm curious -- what is it about the subject matter that <i>you</i> want to see highlighted in play?<br/><br/>I want to give suggestions, but I'm too fuzzy on your goals, so before I propose a <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> re-skin with Exhaustion and Madness re-colored to Despair and Obsession (or something), it'd be nice to know more about what you're looking for.  Is it the intersection of the mundane with the epic (or at least epic-seeming)?  Is it the struggle against a stifling, oppressive, or broken environment (<i>Perfect Unrevised</i> might be fun)?  Is it deep character studies of just how messed up you have to be to risk your life in tights, and where that messed-up-ness gets you (Primetime Adventures' issues)?  Is it sadistic badguys who really put the hero through the wringer (Typhoid Mary still makes me cringe)?  Is it a brave and heroic struggle against all the grimness (Daredevil), or a badass being even grimmer (Punisher)?<br/><br/>Most of the source material I can think of is very much about the lone protagonist, so there's some tension there with a room full of players all wanting to do that.  I think a key decision will be whether to force them to interact a lot more than in the comics, or whether to take turns doing solo stuff that may or may not overlap.  <br/><br/>If I were playing this, I might want to have the cast of player characters be divided between heroes &amp; villains -- Spiderman, Daredevil, Kingpin, the Rose / Rorschach, Night Owl, the Comedian, Ozymadias / Batman, Superman, Joker, Two-Face.  Part of what I like about many of those comics is how the villains were just as plausible, motivated, and captivating as the heroes.  I mean, hell, Constantine <i>is</i> the villain in a lot of his stories.<br/><br/>Also: Preacher.  I would love to play a scene with Jesse Custer and Rorschach.<br/><br/>Anyway, overflowing fandom aside, my thought is that with the right focus, setting, and "party" dynamics, your system options might become more open or obvious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412024/#Comment_412024" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T23:12:24+00:00" title="April 14, 2013 11:12PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>. . .

This requires a lot of setting design before play.  In play, we begin with the broad strokes of "what would happen?" already established, and then we zoom in to find out what would happen to these specific heroes in their specific situations.  Do I begin play with a government agency trying to recruit me, an anti-supers group trying to kill me, and an agent trying to boost my image for marketing dollars?  A rules system for this could come hardwired with certain fictional concerns.<br/><br/>2) The world is the world as we know it.  No setting design required.  Suddenly, superhumans appear!  So what would happen?  Figure it out in play, with the GM (or whoever runs the characters' world) doing their best to guess how the relevant portions of the real world would react.  A rules system for this would probably have to be flexible enough to handle diverse types of fictional concerns at various scales.<br/><br/>What do you think?  Are you looking for one of these over the other?  Something in between?  Something else entirely?<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm missing the point by focusing on "what would happen" in general world terms.  For that stuff, the first comics that come to mind are actually Kick-Ass, the first season of Heroes, and maybe Astro City and Kingdom Come for the more epic stuff.  Hellblazer, on the other hand, is much more "what would happen <i>to this guy</i>" and the world's take on supers is beside the point.  So maybe all you need is a good consequence engine with the right down-to-earth color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412066/#Comment_412066" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T14:15:32+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  2:15PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>So, I'm curious -- what is it about the subject matter that <i>you</i> want to see highlighted in play?<br/></blockquote>\nGood question.
