Inspired by games like Baron Munchausen nand Penny for my Thoughts among others.<br/><br/>The narrative idea is that players (no GM) are the archetypical fantasy adventurers, but long retired. They are visiting a tavern and retelling their previous exploits. Each person wants to make themselves sound like the greatest hero, so they color the the story in their favor. Also, the moment is just not the same, so some facts are being made up.<br/><br/>The plan is for each player to tell a story of a dnd-esque adventure that they played in the past (almost every gamer played some fantasy in their gaming career). The other players will claim that they where a part of this adventure even if they did not in real life. One player starts the story, others can iterupt and ask questions/give options/ challenges.<br/><br/>The mechanic is beer based. Each player starts with a equal amount of beer in a transparent container (pint glass recomended). If you are not the current narrator -adding detail to the story costs you beer. If you interrupt and try to take over the role of narrator you have to drink until you have less than the narrator in his/glass. If you give ideas/complications to the narrator(and your option gets chosen)you get to pour some beer into the narrator's glass (so someone can take over the narration more easily, as he now has more beer).<br/>OK, those are basic mechanics.<br/><br/>On top of that, each player has a character sheet (that looks like a magic scroll) with 3 circles. Each circle has a fate-like aspect or two... Each circle has to have a possitive and negative trait on it-but it can be one, double-edged trait.. Those 6 traits describe the character mechanically.<br/>When you start narrating (for any reason, either the start of the game or you are taking over th narration mid game) you have to incorporate one of your traits into it. Then you put your glass on the circle with this trait. This trait can't be used until you move the glass (either by responding to other players ideas or loosing narration rights).  So you only have 2/3 available traits at any moment.<br/>You use someone's negative trait to challenge them and take over narration (drunkard - you had been drunk as hell that night, you don't remember anything right).<br/>You use your positive trait to incorporate in your narration (great fighter - it was me who dueled the baron, you admitted that I am a better with sword then you are...even drunk you still kept some of your knowledge. So, I grabbed my sword...).<br/>The game progresses like that, with players trying to out do line another in the heroic tale. <br/><br/>Damn,it is late and I am on the tablet that is loosing its charge, I hope that is enough info for you guys to give me some feedback. If you need more info - ask away!<br/><br/>What do you think should be the goal of the game, should it even have a goal apart from storytelling with one upping each other while drinking?<br/>&gt;&gt;should I have a mechanical goals like in Everyone is john?<br/>Would you play this game? Would you play it more if it wasn't beer based (it can be played with tokens easily)?<br/>Should I abandon the idea of traits? Will it not be too much if you are drunk-ish?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431555/#Comment_431555" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-24T13:19:06+00:00" title="April 24, 2014  1:19PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have enough time for a lengthy response, but I love the basic concept here: use previous D&amp;D anecdotes as a formula for story gaming.

Perhaps a player must do some forfeit when he finishes his drink, like crack open a fresh one and share it out with the others while singing a song of their greatness in the style of a bard. This both gives the slow drinking player more to drink and encourages competition to not be the last finished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431656/#Comment_431656" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-26T08:09:54+00:00" title="April 26, 2014  8:09AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it.

Here is a reworking that involves a pitcher and "quaffs" (a quaff is a really big swallow, maybe half a pint.)<br/><br/>1. The Taleteller (you) begins the game with a full beer and a full pitcher.  The game begins with a one line TITLE written on a whiteboard or butcher paper.  "THE RESCUE OF THE PRINCESS" or etc.  You drink a quaff and start telling the story using one of the words on your sheet.  "It was I who rescued the Princess Lourdes from the evil dragon and even won a kiss from that fair lady, thanks to my HEROIC nature."<br/><br/>2a. Beth raises her glass to indicate she has a response.  She has decided to add to the story, and walks over to pour some beer from the pitcher into your mug.  "That's true, and I was the CRAFTY wizard who helped you do it by casting a spell which put the dragon to sleep!"  You continue as the Taleteller.<br/><br/>(or) 2b. Abner raises his glass to indicate he has a response.  He has decided to take over your story, and drinks until his mug is lower than yours.  "That is untrue, for you are in fact COWARDLY and ran away at first sight of the dragon!"  He then turns toward the room and says "Do I speak the truth?"  Everyone who agrees this is true raises their mug.  Majority rules.<br/><br/>3a. (following 2b) If Abner speaks truth (according to the vote), the Taleteller (you) pours a quaff into Abner's mug and hands over the pitcher.  Abner is now the Taleteller, and gets to say what REALLY happened (using another word on his sheet).  "What really happened was my CRAZY distraction made the dragon lose his footing and fall into the sea!"  The next person to raise their mug will either support <i>that</i> story or try to take it over.  If they try to take it over they must drink, speak, and end with "Do I speak the truth?", whereupon a vote will happen again to determine who is the new Taleteller.<br/><br/>(or) 3b. (following 2b) If Abner is lying (according to the vote), the Taleteller pours a quaff into his own mug from the pitcher and adds another sentence to the tale.  "Indeed, my FLEXIBLE muscles held her fair body tightly as we escaped to safety!"  The next person to raise their mug will either support <i>that</i> story or try to take it over.  If they try to take it over they must drink, speak, and end with "Do I speak the truth?", whereupon a vote will happen again to determine who is the new Taleteller.<br/><br/>4. The pitcher might determine when the game is drawing to a close.  Once the last quaff is poured from the pitcher, the final Taleteller gets to take the last turn, wrapping up the story by using one of her own words, and one final vote is taken.  "Do I speak the truth?"

To be honest, pouring into someone's glass was somehow inspired by kid hijacks where you pour some random liquids into a glass to see if someone would drink that <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> It might be alcohol free rules variant. Introducing the pitcher is a great idea! Especially when the pitcher = story time! This is something that will solve the mechanic issues I had, as the underlying goal is to drink beer - you get more beer for good narration.<br/>This combined with majority rules will make a game! Aslf, sir - you are awesome!<br/><br/>As for the name, I was thinking the following:<br/><b>Scroll of GLOATing </b>- this was the original name, it referred to the character sheet looking like a magic scroll. GLOAT in the title stood for Good Lobstronomous Old Adventuring Times. But I think this name is not close enough to D&amp;D we are trying to spoof.<br/><br/>I thought of Tavern Tales - but there is already a lot of stuff called like that, so googling would be a pain. This evolved into <b>Tankard Tales </b>or <b>Taletellers &amp; Tankards</b>.<br/><br/>I love the suggested names and I would like to use them in the text somehow. I love BURPS, I will need to think of a good acronym from it (I am a sucker from acronyms). <br/><br/><b>Beerless rules </b><br/>Each player gets 10 tokens (coins, beads, pretzels?) there is a total of 10xplayer number of tokens in the center (in a bowl, or pitcher). Players use their tokens the same way as they would use their beer, you need to have less than the Taleteller to take over narration and/or you can get more from good narration.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.flightsim.com/vbfs/attachment.php?attachmentid=158910&amp;d=1383854317"/><br/><b>Two finger rule </b><br/>If you have less than 2 to fingers worth of beer in your glass (measure it like <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k77FH-mp1KY/TyX20xvcwKI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/b2RcHvy_HcI/s1600/IMG_5768.JPG" rel="nofollow">that</a>). You can't take over narration, you need to wait until you get more beer this way (usually by giving options, adding detail to the story). If you try to take over narration when having less than 2 fingers worth of beer, other players are encouraged to show you two fingers in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_sign" rel="nofollow">obscene british manner</a>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431829/#Comment_431829" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-29T08:03:19+00:00" title="April 29, 2014  8:03AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2014 11:34AM by Potemkin.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If no one is taking "Beerbards," I will.
