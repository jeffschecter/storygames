However, we're still after more! If there's a game or three you'd like to offer, please let me know. I'll list them on the <a href="http://www.mk-rpg.org.uk/Concrete_Cow_games" rel="nofollow">Concrete Cow games page</a> and do my best to tell the world about how wonderful they are!<br><br>Richard's games are:<br><br><i><a>Monsterhearts"</a>: The Big Game</i><br>Based on the Apocalypse World engine, this is a a story game about the messy lives of teenage monsters. Monsterhearts lets you and your friends create stories about sexy monsters, teenage angst, personal horror, and secret love triangles. When you play, you explore the terror and confusion that comes both with growing up and feeling like a monster.<br>This game will play as a standard game of Monsterhearts, but will include Joe Mcdaldo's sport event mini-game rules for playing 'The Big Game'.<br>Author: Joe Mcdaldo<br>GM: Epistolary Richard<br>Players: 3-6<br>Slot: Morning<br><br><i><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/" rel="nofollow">Fiasco</a>: Fiasco LIVE!</i><br>Fiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong \u2013 inspired by films like Blood Simple, Fargo, The Way of the Gun, Burn After Reading, and A Simple Plan. You\u2019ll play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control and in the end it will probably all go south in a glorious heap of jealousy, murder, and recrimination. It's an award-winning, GM-less game designed to be played in a few hours with six-sided dice and no preparation. During a game you will engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. <br>In Fiasco LIVE! we'll put the emerging clusterfrag on its feet! We'll keep the game at the core, but with a bit of larp, a bit of improv and few props, we'll breathe life into the pivotal moments by acting them out. So ideal players should be willing to throw themselves, literally, into their characters. <br>Fiasco is optimised for 4 players. If we get a fifth or sixth, they'll get to play every other unfortunate who gets dragged into the chaos.<br>Author: Jason Morningstar<br>unGM: Epistolary Richard<br>Players: 3-6<br>Slot: Afternoon<br><br><i>X-perimentals</i><br>(Note, games are not associated with the X-Men, the X Factor or the X-Chromosome)<br>X-perimentals are several short, in-development, indie games experimenting with game mechanics that are a little different. Each game should be between 30 mins to an hour and players can step up, stick in or step out as they need.<br>GM: Epistolary Richard<br>Players: 2+<br>Slot: Evening<br><br/><b>Magazines</b><br/><a href="http://issuu.com/the_gazebo/docs/the_gazebo" rel="nofollow">The Gazebo</a> is a new, online, quarterly magazine about all things gaming. It covers the UK and Ireland, and has articles on RPGs, wargames, boardgames, and CCGs. Issue 1 is out and Issue 2 is coming soon. I'm mentioning it because a) it's good and b) they're including an advert for Concrete Cow in exchange for me mentioning the Gazebo. Sounds like a win-win to me!<br/><br/>So, go check it out.<br/><br/><b>OxCon</b><br/>Finally, a few people are trying to put together a con in Oxford, which I think is a great idea.

(That's Paul Fricker, the author of CoC 7ed, and Mike Mason, ex Kult of Keepers.)<br/><br/><b>Penny Adventures: Zombies!</b><br/>A group of survivors, holed up in a city filled with the walking dead, have found a way out. The only way out.<br/><br/>Penny Adventures is an easy-to-grasp system which puts Player Character's actions and choices at the centre of the story. The game explores the relationships between people struggling together to survive, and makes it easy for the Players to really effect the narrative.<br/><br/>The game will be run by its author, improviser and comedian Edward Croft, as it steps out for its first convention play! Looking for feedback before the game goes to production.<br/><br/>GM: Edward Croft<br/>Players: 3-4<br/><br/><b>Ribbon Drive</b><br/><br/>Tags: Story telling, GMless, no conflict resolution, small scale stories about normal people, may contain adult themes, needs full player buy in.<br/><br/>Ribbon Drive excels at tight, gritty, testing social interaction between the characters in play. It is about creating a road trip where all of the meat is in the interaction between the characters and not so much about the outside world. This will not be an action adventure chase movie. The game is GMless with full shared narration and needs involved players who want to really explore the relationships between the characters in the car, during the game players will explore the possible future dreams of their characters and decide if they will ever be resolved.<br/><br/>The game is based around the mix tapes/CD's/playlists that you build for long road trips. Feel free to bring your own CD if you've made one but don't feel you have to, I will have plenty of premixed CDs with me.<br/><br/>Un-GM: Mik Reed<br/>Additional Players: 2-3                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388588/#Comment_388588" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T11:02:13+00:00" title="August 28, 2012 11:02AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon Burley, author of <i>Golden Heroes</i>, is after more playtesting for his new superhero game, <i>Squadron UK</i>.

There are, no doubt, worse landladies, so you don't object too much to Mrs. Nomed's funny little rules.<br/>Anyway, when what's in the cellar bursts forth upon the unknowing mortal world, frankly, paying your rent a month in advance and wiping your feet when you come through the door will be the least of your worries.<br/>GM: Phil Masters<br/>Players: 3-5<br/>Slot: Probably afternoon, maybe morning<br/><br/><b>Marvel Heroic RPG</b><br/><i>Ninjas on a plane</i><br/>It\u2019s a simple job, you\u2019ve been hired by Nick Fury to escort a dignitary from Europe to New York and ensure he locks his briefcase in a secure vault in New York\u2019s grand central bank.
