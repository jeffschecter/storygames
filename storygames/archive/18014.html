One of the choices was to game with me at the table in the back. I had four boys choose that one and decided to do a little spur of the moment twist on the Apocalypse Engine. I gave them the stats Hot (being physically aggressive), Cold (being cool), Sharp (being smart), and Dark (being weird). They could assign 2,1,0, and -1 to each stat. Then they described in one sentence what they were and then what their goal was.<br/><br/>I ended up with an alien demon hunter, a timestream cop, a fishboy, and a ghost demonlord. It ended up being an amazing example of how kids are so in tune with the principles of AW and improv rpgs in general. The demon hunter described how he lived underground and the fishboy immediately chimed in that he had seen him because he lived in part of the sewers with an underground lake. The ghost added that he phased up through the sidewalk to grab a newspaper and there was an article about the demon hunter on the rampage so he was preparing for a fight. The time cop had a partner to help him out, Slenderman (I have some boys who are obsessed with the urban legend). They started to form pairs based on mutual interests or becoming direct opposition. The fishboy and ghost demonlord allied and the demonlord pledged to help him learn to breathe above water in exchange for fighting the demon hunter. Lots of excitement after they learned how the rolling work and they hit 10+ on any move.<br/><br/>The moves I incorporated were lifted from MH: Manipulate an NPC, Lash Out, Run Away, Shut Down, Hold Steady, and Gaze Into the Dark.<br/><br/>Next Friday, I hope to continue this and see where they take the story. Just small 30 minute sessions of play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406962/#Comment_406962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T16:17:27+00:00" title="February 22, 2013  4:17PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool! Kids say the darndest things; makes me think I was a bit of a dull lad. Ghost Demonlord and Sewer Fishboy. Actually, now that I think about it, might be shades of Hellboy there. One small thing: wouldn't Hot, Cool, BRIGHT, Dark be a better dichotomy? I like words. Words are - uhm... good. I look forward to next Friday's report.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd" title="HyveMynd"><img alt="HyveMynd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/564/nZ3DM2UV4QM5S.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd">HyveMynd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406966/#Comment_406966" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T18:27:37+00:00" title="February 22, 2013  6:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh.

Where I had them create characters from scratch this week, I gave minimal skins. For each skin I picked a special move they could do (Vampire could Hypnotize, Ghost could Creep, etc.).<br/><br/>I ended up with a Vampire, a Queen, a Ghost, and an Infernal. Once again, even though it was different group of kids they immediately began building off each other's ideas with very little direction from me. I just asked questions (What class are you both in? Who's the coolest kid in the school?). They were completely absorbed and ended up in awesome laughing fits as the story became crazier and more complex.<br/><br/>Situations that occurred: <br/>My Infernal didn't want to be in Math class so he decided to use Hot and try to fight the teacher. The roll was awful which led to the Infernal falling over the teacher's desk, head getting stuck in the waste basket, and being taken to the Principal's Office. <br/><br/>The Vampire and The Queen were in Spanish class, and The Infernal texted The Queen for help. she replied with "leave me alone". Moments later, The Queen was in a bad situation, texted the Infernal and he made sure to remind her of how he was abandoned.<br/><br/>I exercised some Principles when I saw The Vampire and The Queen (friends in real life) wanted to partner up in the game. I had them create the Popular Boy through a series of questions and left one seat open next to him. The ensuing lighthearted and hilarious battle between the two girls was hilarious. They have the perfect demeanor and mindset to play out a scene like this and have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I was even more impressed than last week with the total ease the kids play in that imaginary space together. Its something a lot of adult players would envy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
