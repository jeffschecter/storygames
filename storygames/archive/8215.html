I had not come to the social with the intention to run a game or my rulebook, but I did have a copy of the categories, post-its, some dice and my figures for runners &amp; chasers.  I'm a RPG Boy-Scout I know .... always prepared too dive in where other GM's fear to tread!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had two players, Brad and a Lady (<i>sorry forgot your name</i>) interested to start and a third; Ed join in as we were making characters. The Lady had to leave after the first two scenes and another Guy, John took over her character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first making characters was very difficult for the new players, I don't think any of them had played this type of narrative, storytelling game with shared characters before and Brad had said earlier that he was a complete newbie to role-playing.  I gave lots of Question examples and brow-beat them into keeping the game a serious as possible (<i>this helps to avoid the silliness of new gamers or at least mitigate it!</i>).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bar was very noisy so we raised our voices over the music &amp; chatter, and after a while settled in quite nicely to play. Once I got the game going and put some obstacles in their path they rose to challenge and the game moved very smoothly from then on.<br/>\nI decided to go with the cool crashing spaceship, and the Multi-Armed, Black Space-suited Aliens as Chasers ( <i>I never did reveal what the Aliens looked like without their gear.</i>)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <b>\u201cCRASH\u201d</b> scene from inside:<br/>\nRounded gun metal walls, with oily rainbow like patterns moving and fluxing across the whole metallic chamber.  The prisoners are suspended in cages of sharp crystal bars, they float in the air unchained as if gravity was nullified.  They can move around a little, but cannot touch the diamond like bars, nor can they touch the gun metal floor.  The prisoners are dressed in grey spandex like prison unitards with orange trim and belt.  The belt around their waists has solid metal rings hanging from it in many places, maybe it is for locking them down or attaching leashes!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe prisoners notice little, but a sudden change in vibration when the crash happens; because of their inertia-less state.  The crystalline bars that ring their cages are shattered and sharp jagged piles scatter across the buckling and broken gun metal floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are free to move about the chamber but the AG field is still floating them the air a little lower than before the crash.  Smoke billows in from the one oval metallic corridor with panels of scorched metal, frayed lengths of wire and busted bundles of organic tubing hang jaggedly from the warped and gutted ceiling.  Smashed crystalline circuit-boards litter the glassy corridors floor.  Sparks fly, pop and sizzle from the exposed machinery and broken alien devices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Runners are almost Free!  But, their Alien Abductors may be near, they must <b>RUN!</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>O'Flux</b> aka SteveEG                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux" title="ophidian_flux"><img alt="ophidian_flux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux">ophidian_flux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180853/#Comment_180853" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-30T09:52:38+00:00" title="November 30, 2008  9:52AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>[PSI=RUN] Psi-Ko Criminals - Part Two</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Changes and Rule tweaks</u><br/>\nWe used blank pieces of paper for character sheets, on which I wrote at the top \u201c<b><i>When I look in the Mirror I See?</i></b>\u201d and then <b><i>1 ,2, 3</i></b> numbers for questions with lots of space for answers.<br/>\nI had my own Large Category Sheet for dice placement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI changed the Chase and Capture Categories widening them a bit and giving the chasers more bite I think!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>CHASE</b><br/>\n1 : Chasers move Two Scenes closer to the Runners.<br/>\n2,3 : Chasers move One Scene closer.<br/>\n4,5 : Chasers make no progress.<br/>\n6 : Chasers get stalled &amp; fall back One Scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>OR</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>CAPTURE</b><br/>\n1 : All Runners Captured.<br/>\n2 : Half of the Runners Captured.<br/>\n3,4: One Runner Captured.<br/>\n5,6: Runners Evade Capture.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor <b>Injury</b> I made players lose their Extra Die!<br/>\n( <i>This happened to only one character and was for the Whole Session!</i> )<br/>\n<br/>\nI changed the <b>Crossroad</b> ( <i>Epilogue</i> ) choices to:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Home, Turn the Tables, The Mission, Hiding, A New Family, Face to Face, On the Run, A Discovery</b> and <b>Lost!</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>O'Flux</b> aka SteveEG                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux" title="ophidian_flux"><img alt="ophidian_flux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux">ophidian_flux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180854/#Comment_180854" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-30T09:54:14+00:00" title="November 30, 2008  9:54AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2008 10:16AM by ophidian_flux.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>[PSI=RUN] Psi-Ko Criminals \u2013 Part Three</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b><u>After the CRASH</u></b><br/>\nThe runners realize they are no longer prisoners and look over their environment and options.   They decide to press some buttons on a console below them.  Ed's character reaches down (<i>I make him roll standard dice plus Harm</i>).   His character \u201cMetal Legs\u201d, I'll call him (<i>never did name characters</i>) succeeds and the AG field in the jail chamber cuts off, they float gently to the floor.   Brad's character \u201cWeather Man\u201d cause a wind to clear the nearby floor of nasty shards of broken crystal and metal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wind seems to be coming from the corridor so they head down it carefully to come to the broken edge of the Alien spaceship, a two storey drop with cables hanging down and jagged metal edges.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe \u201cLady\u201d rolled to get them down and was successful, they all climb down with little trouble.<br/>\n(<b>Reveal:</b> She has a memory of receiving the Dragon Tattoo for the gang killing in Prison.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, I do a <b>Cut Scene:</b> of the Alien Chasers.  A hulking black suited alien with a bulbous helmet and no neck.  It works frantically at a strange console with its multiple arms pressing metal buttons, pulling crystal levers and squeezing plasticine like controls or input devices.  A multi-faceted Alien Tri-Viewer (<i>Holographic</i>) through this device a psychedelic pool and a 3D avatar of the Alien Overlord in instructing the jailer to recapture the escaping animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, the 'Lady' player had to leave.  John takes her place and her character.  I make the players roll to move to a new scene (<i>basic roll Goal, Chase, Reveal</i>) John rolls to get him into the game.  This gets them to the \u201cGrassy Plains\u201d and causes the aliens to be stalled back one scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Cut Scene:</b> 'Chasers'  I narrate the Alien being ordered to go after the animals; it goes to the weapons locker and there is an explosion of broken weapon, chemicals, sparks and ammunition!  The aliens are no longer in the chase scene.<br/>\n<br/>\n(<b>Reveal:</b> 'Lady' \u201cTattoo Girl\u201d  finds out She is a psychic mechanic a mental forge that makes machines work better)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the Grassy Plains, they see a river five miles away straight ahead down in the valley and forest on either side of them with mountains in the distance after the forest.  \u201cMetal Legs\u201d decides to make weapons by using his PSI power on trees to alter reality.  He is successful but gets harmed in the process; acid (<i>sap from trees altered by his power</i>) burns his arm and hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nEd \u201cMetal Legs\u201d loses his extra dice for the whole session.   They manage to make some pine cone  grenades.<br/>\n<br/>\n(<b>Reveal:</b> A chip was implanted in \u201cMetal Legs\u201d brain that can source all digital knowledge of the world  no matter how trivial allowing him to see and know the true Reality and Alter it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>O'Flux</b> aka SteveEG                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux" title="ophidian_flux"><img alt="ophidian_flux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ophidian_flux">ophidian_flux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180856/#Comment_180856" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-30T09:54:34+00:00" title="November 30, 2008  9:54AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2008 10:19AM by ophidian_flux.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>[PSI=RUN] Psi-Ko Criminals \u2013 Part Four</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b><i><u>FOREST</u></i></b><br/>\n(<i>Brad</i>) \u201cWeather Man\u201d rolls to move on to the forest.

They approach the tower and see a ranger up high above.  He yells down \u201c<i>Are you guys lost or something?</i>\u201d to which the Lady (<i>John</i>) replies \u201c<i>we escaped from the crash back there!</i>\u201d.  The ranger puts two and two together and raised his rifle at them seeing they looked like criminals in their \u201c<u>grey and orange</u>\u201d unitards with chainable belts.  \u201c<i>Don't move! criminals, eh</i>?\u201d  He yells to his partner \u201c<i>Bob, we got rats loose here!</i>\u201d  The ranger aims his rifle at the strange men below the tower.<br/>\n<br/>\n(<i>Brad</i>) \u201cWeather Man\u201d decides to destroy the tower with \u201cLightning\u201d and summons up dark stormy clouds.  He rolls and is successful only maybe too well.   Multiple lightning strikes come down from low dark clouds, blasting the tower into sawdust before the PSI runners' blazing eyes.  The rangers are fried to crispy dust.   The runners are unharmed and covered in burnt sawdust.

After many resting they begin their hike again and by midday came upon a camp site with 2 tents and a sun break between them.   Out comes a young blonde girl of 17 years old.   \u201cMetal Legs\u201d runs up and grabs the bag of salt and vinegar potato chips from her.  She screams \u201c<i>Oh No Stop, Don't Hurt me!</i>\u201d and drops to a fetal position crying and sobbing.  A tall brunette, not much older than 19, comes out and shouts \u201c<i>Get away from her, leave us alone!</i>\u201d.   The criminal PSI runners ignore the girls and start raiding the tents.  \u201cMetal Legs\u201d finds a box of chips and cannot stop eating them.   A little while later, two young men came back to their camp site.  The tall blond drops an armful of fire wood, took the hatchet from his side and shouts \u201c<i>Get away from my girlfriend, Mister!</i>\u201d.   The other guy is carrying an axe for cutting logs; he lifts it menacingly.  \u201cMetal Legs\u201d uses his PSI power to change the reality of the world, hoping to defuse a bad situation  He rolls very badly because of his injury.  The Psi power goes wild and alters the campers' sex, changing the boys into girls and the girls into boys.  The girls that are now muscle bound men get up and move menacingly towards the trio of runners.  The boys as they a shocked to find they are now female, seeing their chests swell and groins shrink; Freak Out! and drop their axes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Cut Scene:</b> 'Chasers' Black Egg Ships are zoom back and forth on the 'Grassy Plains' trying to pick up the Runners trail, they wing and zip overhead in the visible distance light lances searching.

He causes hot air to create foggy steam, that dehydrates the boys/girls making them fatigued and  they drop to the ground in a dead faint. He was trying to create fog but the confusion in his mind over the Altered sexuality and reality cause him to lose control.  He is successful in moving the team back into the Crash stage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Cut Scene:</b> 'Chasers' The Black Egg Ships also move back into the Crash Scene, as a detector in the self repairing starship starts working (<i>when the Psychic Mechanic is nearby</i>) again at top efficiency.

Hence the plan to take on/take out the Chasers and steal the starship.<br/>\nThe most interesting rolls were by the injured Runner. But in some ways I think removing the extra die is too harsh.<br/>\nI'm thinking of using a penalty die to remove one of the dice rolled and letting the injured player keep their extra die, that way it may randomly hurt a lot more if you roll high or a lot less if you score low on your penalty die.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran a game last Sunday that had a lot of bad rolls and two runners injured then captured using my penalty die method, and it work perfectly well in that situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>O'flux</b> aka SteveEG                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
