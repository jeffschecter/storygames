I feel confident in saying that I'm on the lower spectrum of experience with role-playing games than most people on this forum.<br/><br/>2. My problem isn't with how "Actor Stance" is formulated as an idea or definition.<br/><br/>My problem is that I seem to have some cognitive dissonance when it comes to Actor stance. Description and narration work fine for me: I can easily hold my character out at a distance from me in the third person with these techniques. When it comes to first-person play, however, I have trouble. I have a hard time getting a grip on my character. I have a hard time saying what I think my character would actually say. Or rather, I have a hard time figuring out my character enough such that I feel confident in saying/doing what my character would say/do.<br/><br/>Caveat: I've never played in a game that's gone longer than two sessions. Is this the main problem?<br/><br/>Will more play cultivate and hone the necessary skills for Actor stance to really click with me? Because, to clarify, I do want it to.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Self-identification with any of these issues?<br/><br/>EDIT: Okay, so <i>after</i> I posted this I went back to the Forge and looked up Actor Stance, and I didn't quite get it right. For this post, assume I mean "Talking in-character, first-person-wise."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204622/#Comment_204622" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T01:14:16+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  1:14AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could try reading Play Unsafe.<br/><br/>Otherwise, think of three things that define your character when they interact with others. They don't have to be nice or nasty. Just three pertinent things that you can do that will help you define the role.<br/><br/>So we played AD&amp;D on Wednesday. My PC is a thug (thief kit AD&amp;D 2nd Ed). So I decide he's pretty randomly violent. It's one of his primary means of social intercourse. It has got me into trouble already, but nothing too bad, but good for the game. Also he has very low wisdom, and I've made him trusting, he just goes along with what others say. And in a group of thieves and con men, he's already been ripped off several times. And in fact, his wisdom is so low that it's affected his self-image. He keeps out of the limelight and is even bullied by the other PCs. It's working well. <br/><br/>He speaks rather slowly and has a tendancy to muddle things up. But actually he's not stupid and comes up with some good ideas.<br/><br/>In a recent game of 3:16, one player just decided to go along with whoever he thought was in charge of the group. That worked very well. Another read low charisma to mean boring, in that he explained things to the n-th degree. Once you've got something to hang your performance on, it gets a lot easier.<br/><br/>You can even try copying the mannerism of a well known character. Playing Buffy, are you over-confident but hollow Faith or bumbling but steadfast Xander?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204624/#Comment_204624" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T01:20:56+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  1:20AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ever tried LARPing?

Is this the main problem?</blockquote>\nProbably, yes.<br/><br/>One thing you might want to try doing is playing a broad stereotype that you're familiar with, just to get you over the "I have no idea what my character would say" thing.  Play someone who you already understand, and/or who you've seen enough examples of in various media to be able to steal liberally from.  This is especially useful if you're generally playing single-session games, since you won't have the time to do anything much more elaborate (not without more practice, anyway).<br/><br/><br/>Besides that, here are some things that I do to find an in-character voice, which you may or may not find helpful:<br/><br/>- I try to rehearse/monologue to myself in-character during the week.  Basically, I think up some kind of conversational scenario (usually something to do with whatever I think's coming up next in the game), and I try out different lines on myself, the same way I would if I was writing a script.  Sometimes I can find a use for those lines in the game, sometimes I can't -- but either way, it ends up being useful just because it gives me time to work out what the character's voice is and that'll inform how I play him in the game.<br/><br/>- If I can, I immerse myself in books/videos that have the kind of voices I want my character to have.  Like if I'm thinking "hard-boiled detective," it's off to re-read Hammett and Chandler and watch "Brick" again and so on, so that when we sit down to play the rhythm of that language and its idioms are fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>- I ask for time to think about what to say in-character when I need it.  Basically everyone in our group does this, just a polite "Hang on, I need to think about what my character would say in this situation," and everyone else gives whoever asked for it some breathing room to work out what their next line is.<br/><br/>- I try to use the character's physicality as a tool: does he pace?  Lean on things?  Tilt his head skeptically?  Grimace a lot?  Scratch his ear nervously?  Whatever it is that my character does, I put it to work for me: if I'm leaning against a wall the same way my character does, it helps pull me that little bit more into character and makes finding the words easier.<br/><br/>- I don't rely on my (iffy) acting skills alone:  I'll signpost emotions for people around me ("my character is visibly furious, maybe an inch away from punching someone or something, and he says...."), I'll narrate his private thoughts, I'll state my intentions ("He's hoping that gentle, oblique questioning will get you to open up about the accident").  I don't expect that me speaking in-character is the ideal tool for every situation, so I use whatever tools will work.  This, strangely enough, takes the pressure off in-character speech for me and makes it easier to get into a good flow with it.  I don't recommend getting locked into an "all or nothing" thing with speaking in-character: that's possibly too much pressure for definitely too little reward.  Ideally, you want to use it when it makes sense to use it and when it's fun to use it, and NOT use it when it doesn't make sense and it isn't fun.<br/><br/>- I sometimes use the buddy system: I'll work especially closely with another player to make our characters have lots and lots of in-character conversation about all kinds of stupid, pointless things, just for the sake of talking in-character.  Then when I want to talk in-character to anyone else, I've got a firmer sense of how to do that thanks to all the practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204658/#Comment_204658" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T07:14:10+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  7:14AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another call for larping here, <br/><br/>bring a friend  (both as a buddy, and considering larp as a omg r we doing this right buddy), have fun, repeat. <br/><br/>chances are you'll find they last longer than 2 sessions as well as being more kind to you aspiring actor stance vibe.

I have played in lots of groups, and not all of them entice me to dive into the character. Acceptance is the  stance a group need, to get you into character.<br/><br/>Or it may be that you are not an actor. I am not. I am not very good at acting. I'm not very good at playing my character, but I am good at imagining my character and speaking on his behalf. And that makes the day, in any role-playing game. Forget about being an actor; be yourself, and show empathy for your character.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204861/#Comment_204861" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T21:28:07+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  9:28PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoo!

This would work equally for PCs, I think, though I haven't really considered it before. Examples are, looks up while thinking, doesn't finish sentences, speaks very fast, leans forward intently while listening, plays with earlobe when lying, very open body language.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
