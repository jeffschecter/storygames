But, MAN, does it tell a "story."<br/><br/>from <a href="/reader/view/feed/http%3A%2F%2Fplaythisthing.com%2Fallposts%2Ffeed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Play This Thing</a> by IanSchreiber:<br/>Game designer Brenda Brathwaite is perhaps best known for her work on the classic <em>Wizardry</em> and <em>Jagged Alliance</em> series of PC games, although she has certainly kept busy since. Her latest project is in fact a series of six <em>non-digital</em> games, and it is one of those games that I write about today.<br/><br/><em>Train</em> is not your standard board game. It comes on a full-sized window, not in a cardboard box. There is no company logo on the rules, because there is no publisher. You cannot buy it, because only one copy exists in the world and it is not for sale. You cannot play it, unless you see it in person. If you do see it in person, it will not be at a game store but at an art gallery. And when you do play it, you will only play it once because it was intentionally designed to have no replay value. This goes way beyond the \u201cindie\u201d aesthetic, beyond perhaps where many so-called \u201cart games\u201d have gone, to something that is such uncharted territory for games that we don\u2019t even have a name for it yet.<br/><br/>In terms of mechanics, <em>Train</em> is a relatively conventional roll-and-move, race-to-the-end game. Each turn you roll a die and either add that many passengers to your train car, or move your train car that many spaces forward. The objective is to deliver passengers to a series of locations, the names of which are printed on \u201cterminus\u201d cards. To give the play more of a German-game aesthetic, event cards are introduced that allow you to speed your car forward, switch tracks, block other people\u2019s forward progress, take over other players\u2019 cars, or derail a train car.<br/><br/>It doesn\u2019t take very long for the first person to reach the end of the track with their first load of passengers. And they turn over the card and discover that their destination was Auschwitz.<br/><br/>And then you realize all of the subtle things that you missed in the printed rules and on the game itself. The broken glass on the window, an allusion to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kristallnacht</a>. The word <em>terminus</em> itself, that now sounds more ominous than it used to. Most telling of all, the end condition in the rules that cryptically states, \u201cTrain is over when it ends.\u201d So much of the rules are like that, intentionally left open to player interpretation \u2013 incidentally, this is also why you will be unlikely to see an online version any time soon.<br/><br/>With the flip of one card, you realize what you have done during play. You crammed a bunch of wooden pawns uncomfortably into your train car, even stacking them on top of each other, because you thought it didn\u2019t matter. You played cards to speed your train to its destination. You played intelligently and optimized the mechanics in your favor, and you won. And that means you lost.<br/><br/>It\u2019s easy to claim ignorance: I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, I was only following the rules. But once you do know the results of your actions\u2026 do you keep playing? This is the important question that <em>Train</em> asks. It asks using the play of a game, in a way that could not be replicated in any other artistic medium. And now it is no longer a board game, but takes on the properties of a tabletop RPG. Do you refuse to play? Do you continue playing, with the new goal of saving everyone (a goal that is very possible within the framework of the mechanics)? Do you keep playing anyway in order to further explore the dark efficiency of the system?<br/><br/>As with <a href="http://playthisthing.com/super-columbine-massacre-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Super Columbine Massacre RPG</a>, the very mention of using a game to examine a serious topic is something that will surely follow with some critical praise from people who desperately want any excuse to claim games as an art form, and horrendous damnation from people who will assume that by virtue of its game-ness it automatically trivializes the subject material. Both positions are unfortunately arguments from ignorance, made all the more frustrating by how difficult it will ultimately be for people to play this thing. And yet, <em>Train</em> is what it is, and having played it myself I have to say that it could not be any other way.<br/>----------<br/>Discuss. *shudder*                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207286/#Comment_207286" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T08:19:03+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  8:19AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's brilliant.

(Though, yes, the writer of the review seems to imply that with "lost.") But rather more importantly, it asks "do you continue playing, now that you know the moral framework of the game?" That choice, indeed, become a bit of a LARP game--realize that there's other gallery goers and game players right there with you. How you react--emotionally when reacting to the reveal, and practically when you choose how/if you will continue to play--becomes at least as important (to me) as the visceral impact of the reveal. (And I pity the person who wouldn't feel SOMETHING other than persnickety at the reveal, even if only for a moment.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>the very mention of using a game to examine a serious topic is something that will surely follow with some critical praise from people who desperately want any excuse to claim games as an art form, and horrendous damnation from people who will assume that by virtue of its game-ness it automatically trivializes the subject material.</blockquote>Sound familiar, Jason? What was the term... "torture porn" or some-such (for Grey Ranks)? Did anyone every write an AP about players who didn't know the whole plot cycle, maybe a con game with beginners? I'd be curious to see if folks had a similar reveal when playing, and if their reaction might have been similar to Train (or the opposite, being among the aggrieved).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

I think this is what makes me inclined to be a bit... hostile?... to Eric's post. Yes, it's a bait-and-switch (assuming you pay no attention to the mentioned clues and hints).

Nu-uh, don't buy it. You could say the exact same thing about a Unreal mod where you're a guard in charge of "processing" folks into the gas chambers, and I'd say that sort of "exploration" is amoral. You're playing optimally (you get more points for gassed folks than if you have to shoot them because they refuse to be herded); you're actions caused no harm to anyone (just avatars and NPCs, only a bit more realistically depicted than wooden pawns); you're intent isn't malicious, because your actions are taking place for "safe exploration and learning." You're alone, no one is hurt, you're just trying to "win."<br/><br/>I'd say even PLAYING is a loss. So, on some level, your qualifiers that expunge you of moral culpability are insufficient (to me). There might be some other thing you didn't mention, but which you feel moves such "exploration" away from moral grounds to mere game play.<br/><br/>Heck, one could be herding last-day puppies at the pound, with a skin for the exact same Unreal mod; and I'd say one would be FAR better positioned, morally, by even participating.

I think the point of the work (remember, she's a game designer!) is to see how revealed rules of play impact desire to continue playing, object of continued play, and personal perspective of the (in this case) color of the game.<br/><br/>Some folks would look at her in disgust and walk off in a huff. Others might get into the "dark efficiencies" in a purely competitive mode; while still others might try to redeem themselves (or just "do the right thing, now that I know") by playing for the alternate game outcome of rescuing their former victims. Whenever ANYONE "gets it," though, I imagine they have a strong emotional reaction, if only for a moment, because of the dark history. (Which is sort of my puppies point--you'd get a different, and I'd argue lesser, emotional response if you were loading puppies to be euthanized rather than people to be genocided.)<br/><br/>Anyhow... I just think it's MOST interesting in the "LitRPG," "Game As Message" thing we've discussed before. That's sort of the tack I'd prefer, for this thread (not that I have any say, really): can we leverage such a reveal process in RPGs-with-a-message games?<br/><br/>Jason, you say folks would know the context of Grey Ranks? I'd beg to differ--I knew nothing about it, though I suppose establishing place and time and the teens' situation would give me a pretty solid idea of the shitty factor. And then, yeah, I suspect the basic rules of play would reveal the whole sacrifice/betrayal balance and how it's going to push my kid into a dark place.<br/><br/>But could the game be taught in such a way as to not "front-load" that stuff, similarly to Train. Now, in Train's case, there was no system element, per se, held back for the reveal. Rather, it was "mere" color--flip the card and it says "Disneyland" and no one says shit (except maybe "God, what a brand placement whore!"). Hmmm... and color is one of those things a lot of RPGs put first and foremost (and GMs, too, when pitching a game to play); it seems odd to think of writing an RPG (or similar) where a KEY, CRITICAL aspect of setting-establishing color is left out until a reveal.<br/><br/>Hmmm... actually, I can think of one RPG we all know and love that does precisely this trick (delay a KEY setting reveal). Dread: TFBOP<br/><br/>SPOILER - Dread Players DO NOT READ FURTHER!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In Dread, the whole "front" is that you're fighting demons, so "of course" you are the good guys, and your Mentors are maybe even Angels, ya?<br/><br/>Nah. Your Mentors are also demons, who merely want to oppose other demons' incursions into the game world to delay the final war between Heaven and Hell until Hell has a shot of winning it! It's *intended* that a campaign arc eventually have this reveal, to fuck with the players. Now, that's not quite as "owchie" as Train, because, hey, at least you were killing demons; and now you've got a new target... your former Mentors! Your in-game actions have been moral in intent and outcome, but not in efficient cause. You only learn now, too late, that your spur to action was another one--in fact, a far more devious and dangerous one--of the things you've fought all along.<br/><br/>SO, yeah, that's one example of a late reveal that's designed to elicit an emotional reaction in the participant's mind, not "in the fiction" or in the character's mind only. THAT's the rubber-to-road moment I find cool about Train (err... wheel-to-rail?). THAT's the technique I'd like to unpack--it's potential for LARP plot structuring is enormous!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207346/#Comment_207346" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T11:08:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2009 11:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think you can generate a lot of really neat play-juice from Big Reveals.

Even if there's no choice about where or if you're sending the people (and maybe even there is some choice there--without having played the game or even read the rules, it's hard to say), there's a choice about how you do so.  You can cram the people in, stacking them like tokens, or you can fill the trains in a more reasonable manner.  Sure, you can say, "But it's just a game.  They're just little wooden people.  Why *shouldn't* I pack them in as tightly as possible?"  But I suspect one of the points of the game is to draw a parallel between that way of thinking and the way the people who ran such trains probably thought: if you reduce things to numbers, to abstract representations, it's all too easy to do terrible things without even noticing.<br/><br/>But everyone's got their own opinion.  Again, I haven't seen or played the game.

I think that the lack of context is probably somewhat deliberate: games are, ultimately, mechanical things, like algorithmic stories run by humans. If you want more context, watch Schindler's List or whatever. Games excel at providing mechanisms, not context.<br/><br/>I'd argue that the art, or the statement, or whatever you call it happens entirely in the play setting. The context and window dressing could be easily substituted. If the game was played on a patch of grass (maybe dead grass) and was about leading a hike that turned out to be the forced migration of native americans, the general idea would still work: you've been made a participant and you now have to confront what you've done, however distant that seems.<br/><br/>I think that saying moving pieces on a board is not enough to make people consider the subject matter is not a very strong argument in a decade when you could easily wipe out entire nations by clicking the wrong button on the wrong computer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207465/#Comment_207465" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T18:11:43+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  6:11PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2009 6:20PM by Eric.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I withdraw all of my comments about context.

I find it hard to believe that anyone could look at the play components and not guess what the game was "really about."  And that makes it really hard for me to imagine this game ever being played at all.  Like Eric says, anybody who guessed the "mystery" theme of the game would be unlikely to actually play, given the cultural ethos about the Holocaust.  Seems like the game might need to be a bit more subtle to be truly effective.<br/><br/>Also, in my mind, a better way to make the same statement would be to reveal the "mystery" before players actually finished the game.  Say, one or two moves before the end.  That way, one of the key issues for the players would be <i>do you actually finish the game</i>?  The social contract of games generally states that, if finishing a game is reasonable, then you're socially obligated to do so.  Also, players who'd become strongly invested in winning would have to abandon that drive if they decided not to finish the game.  I'd be much more interested in seeing how that played out in different groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207488/#Comment_207488" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T20:51:17+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  8:51PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on the side of "it doesn't matter." Without the proper framing of the moral dimension this game isn't an exploration of morals. It's an attempt at a cheap guilt trip, the same sort of trick I've seen emotionally abusive couples (or abusive peer pressure groups amongst teens) play on one another. Hopefully the artist learns from this experiment and in the future makes something that engages people in ways more likely to produce the desired reflection and introspection.<br/><br/>The idea of boardgames (and other non-rpgs) borrowing from rpgs is a good one. It's not new, but it should be explored further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207490/#Comment_207490" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T21:04:34+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:04PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It reminds me of the Lego Auschwitz playset some Polish artist made a while back:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://bezalel.secured.co.il/zope/home/he/1173510036/1176612903/arad3.jpg"/><br/><br/>He got serious enquiries about buying these playsets, too.

I also find the instance that no one would ever want to play this twice, or outside a measeum or ever have to make more than one copy to be interesting too. Is specifically limiting your audience some new vogue in artistic circles to make your art more arty and those who find your game more worthy.
