Sometime in the next miniseries, there will be an election for the executive of the Exodus-II generation ship.<br/><br/>I'm really geeked about this.  An election feels like an ideal framework for a story game miniseries, since it has a built-in climax and most game action can be tied back into it. It can lurk in the background and burst into prominence at any moment, and it can make people behave in squirrelly ways for the sake of politics, which is very neat to me.  I totally love stories of withering ethics and compromised values.<br/><br/>So, I'm looking for an elections system to bolt onto Heroquest.  The election may involve PC candidates.  At the very least, the PCs should be able to use their abilities to influence the campaign.  <br/><br/>The stock HQ extended contest mechanic doesn't feel quite right, since you're fighting over APs rather than voters, and APs behave differently than voters -- their number swells and wanes over the course of the contest, and I don't want to always have to explain that away as vote fraud or disenfranchisement.  Maybe extended contests could be kitted out to feel more election-y, but I thought I'd ask if anyone had other approaches.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74099/#Comment_74099" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T16:29:40+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  4:29PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not normally a fan of Extended Contests but I think they would work really well for an election. Seems to mirror the reality pretty well. One candidate announces a policy, makes a speech, or accuses the other of involvement in some scandal or other. A low bid might be represented by an appearance on daytime TV, announcing some new anti-graffiti laws, or a speech about family values. A medium bid might be represented by an appearance on some hard-hitting news show, announcing some new 'anti-terror' laws, or making a speech about immigration. Really high bids could include blatant character assassination of the other side, radical new policies, speeches on controversial issues like abortion, and so on. After each exchange, the AP totals reflect the ebb and flow of public support. The very final roll of the dice would take place on election day itself, and then the votes are counted. <br/>\n<br/>\nMark                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74106/#Comment_74106" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T16:53:47+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  4:53PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>If you're thinking along these lines, it sounds like you haven't quite gotten what extended conflicts represent to begin with. APs don't model anything other than how close you are to ultimately getting the outcome you desire. Round-to-round losses don't quite map to any particular outcome in the fictional reality. It's really supposed to be that abstract, and it can be a little tricky to wrap your head around if you're used to the "combat" system of traditional RPGs.<br/><br/><i>Hero Wars</i> did a good job of presenting this clearly. It's slightly less clear in <i>HeroQuest</i>, where at least one of the examples is actively bad.<br/><br/>I predict Mike Holmes will be along shortly to explain everything much better than I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74111/#Comment_74111" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T17:17:51+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  5:17PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Larry--<br/><br/>You've stated my objection to extended contests in a better way than I could: they are too abstract.

This is an ongoing game, not something we're just starting, and while I'm not super-keen on extended contests they're not a showstopper for me.  The game works well enough otherwise, and the extended contests (or long chain of augments feeding into a single final bigass simple contest at the end, as you suggest) would probably be okay-ish.<br/><br/>The thing is, because HQ is so abstract and makes so few assumptions, it seems like an awesome platform for bolt-on minigames.

If the election is needed as a plot for a particular session then things can go wrong or stuff can happen to raise the tension levels.  If the given episode needs to concentrate on other things then the election should be ticking along happily with no real changes or attention needed.<br/><br/>I te kore, ki te po, ki te ao marama.<br/> - Inquisitor Ignatius                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74329/#Comment_74329" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T21:19:27+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  9:19PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I understand it, Johnzo would like a subsystem that would introduce some uncertainty in the result, so it's not merely a group consensus or a GM fiat.  While I'd be perfectly satisfied to have the entire election process and result resolved entirely through narration because I trust the group, I can see the appeal of that risk and uncertainty.  We need a point where the result is neither entirely arbitrary nor entirely random; the dice rolls should not be more important then the players' efforts.<br/><br/>What I would be most interested in seeing, if we need a system at all, is one where the degree of success on any given roll indicates the degree of control over narration, like in <i>octaNe</i>.  I would also like to see explicit stakes being set for the important rolls, rather than pass/fail; something to make the roll interesting either way.  While for the GM it may be equally interesting to have the public favour turn for or against the <i>Pointdexter for President</i> campaign, from the players' perspective only one outcome is fun if we've just spent the last hour trying to get Pointdexter nominated. <br/><br/>In theory, we can do that with the <i>Heroquest</i> system by tying narration control with the degree of success from critical failure to critical success.  However, because of the way we've monkeyed with the system, we've dramatically reduced the range of modifiers we can apply to die rolls (we have few abilities and we use just about the same combination of augments for every roll) so that the variation comes primarily from the roll and hero point bidding, not from abilities.  Consequently, we mostly get results ranging from minor defeat to minor victory; and if we get a more extreme result it's because of the die roll -- which, of course, has a flat curve and thus gives fluke criticals 20% of the time.  I would prefer to find a way to make results more dependent on (1) the story, (2) our good ideas, and (3) the characters' abilities.  <br/><br/>As a starter, I think that stake-setting and adjudicated narration rights would go a long way towards making the election rules interesting in play.  I would also like to see the PCs get a few more abilities on their character sheets (easily justified as an end-of-season power-up) so that we'd have a little more variety in the stacking of augments.  And if we want to make me really happy, we trade the d20 for 2d10 and you can have one "10" result explode per mastery you have in your augmented score.  Sure, it makes middling results common too, but give an edge to abilities rather than die rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74347/#Comment_74347" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T04:07:04+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  4:07AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>As I understand it, Johnzo would like a subsystem that would introduce some uncertainty in the result, so it's not merely a group consensus or a GM fiat.

Why couldn't you do this as an extended contest?  The book has the example of representing a romance as an extended contest over a long period: the contest gets resolved over a series of sessions but people are still doing their normal adventuring things in the meantime as well.  You do the same with the election.  APs in the contest represent the current opinion poll ratings, rather than voters directly.  Every time that something comes up in play that affects the campaigns of the candiates, you do an exchange in the EC.  If there's nothing directly affecting the election, you just leave that EC (and its AP totals) to one side until it comes up again.  You get variety in the narration because you describe the action, then decide size of AP bid and most apporpriate ability and augments (use the Propaganda rules from Burning Wheel: Jihad or Burning Empires for inspiration if you want).  You also get to alter the narration depending on the results of the exchange in the EC.<br/><br/>It could go like this:<br/><br/>Player: We need a candidate that all the Green Party factions can get behind.  Let's get Pointdexter nominated!  I'll use my 'Backroom Dealings' ability, augmented with my Relationship with the Chair of the selection board.  I've also got the photos of the Chair, the avocado, and the glitter dust.  That's got to be worth something.<br/><br/>GM: Sounds good.  The photos will give you +10 on this exchange.  The main opposition will be the Deep Green faction leader's 'Fiery Rhetoric' as he denounces Pointdexter as a softie.  You're making a reasonable effort, so I think an 18AP bid sounds right.  <br/><br/>Player.  Cool!  Let's roll!<br/><br/>&lt;clatter&gt; &lt;clatter&gt;<br/><br/>GM: Minor defeat for you!  OK, Pointdexter gets the nomination, but everyone realises that he's the compromise candidate.  The Yellow Party makes much of this in the press and you slip three points in the opinion polls.  Let's press on with the dragon and the damsel and I'll do the Yellow's response next session.  <br/><br/>How does that sound?<br/><br/>Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74365/#Comment_74365" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T06:52:35+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  6:52AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Johnzo doesn't like extended contests and I don't think anyone else in the group is very fond of them either.

I'm tentative about explaining my POV here, since I'm sensing that the group in question has formed quite a negative opinion of ECs (and the HQ system as a whole, really), and I'm not sure how much you really are looking for a solution. I'll forge ahead a little, but let me know if, in fact, this is off-topic for the thread, and I'll stop immediately. If you're not interested in being convinced then it's not worth my time nor yours to go forward.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, let me say that there is another HQ mechanic that you can use to simulate elections really well. Community support. That is, you have players do several rolls to obtain community support from different groups, and then the election is just a "ritual" in which all of these bonuses apply. So each "maneuver" by each character ends up being some sort of appeal to obtain the votes of a certain demographic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that these can overlap. I can win the votes from a village, generally, but then you can win the votes of the warriors of that village. Any community can be sliced up in any way you care to approach it, and can provide many different support augments. You can win the hearts of all of the weavers in the land, even though there are several in the village that I've already won. Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen on election day, you have a simple contest, add the augments up, and roll to see who wins with the simple contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd still do it as an EC myself, however. Because, in part, you can use the above model inside of the EC model, and do much more complex things. I find that as an input/output simulation, HQ does an outstanding job. What it doesn't do is the middle part where it tries to calculate all of the complex interactions of things. The thing is, you could never write up an accurate rules system to figure out how elections are won at that internal interaction level - we just don't know how it works. If we did, we could predict elections way in advance, and there would be known optimal strategies. There just aren't. So elections are perfectly suited to the sort of input/output simulation that HQ contests provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about extended contests is that you can get as fiddly with them as you like. Again, let's look at Community Support. On your turn, you can have your character go before the United Generation Ship Parts-Makers Union, and tell them that you'll fight for higher wages for working folks, and hope to gain some level of support from them. As this is gaining an augment, it's considered an "unrelated action." No AP changes hands. What's cool about this, is that the community support bonus gained can be used later for various things. Yes, it can probably be used for the last burst to win the election. But before that... let's say you get the support of a biker gang somehow. And then you try to sabotage a meeting that your opponent is having somewhere else. Well, the bikers can augment that sabotage attempt, perhaps. All depends on the nature of the contest in which you recruited them (which impacts which inputs you can use in that contest).<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, you get the same effects as the non-EC method, but you can do oh so much more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's cool about the EC is that actions taken represent the sorts of political maneuvers that one actually makes on the campaign trail. As people have mentioned, you can try any number of types of stunts. And these can be directed against an opponent, or elsewhere to gain support. So it's not always about just exchanging AP, but "maneuvering" and "gaining support."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of direct competition, you'd have stuff like bringing up issues, and trying to create the more attractive platform plank for that issue. Ever play the boardgame "Road to the White House"? Great game. The strategy is all about trying to bring to the public attention the issues on which your candidate has strong appeal. Votes are recorded somewhat in the abstract as a result of the stops the candidate makes, and the results of the issues as they relate to a character. You can do precisely this with EC actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's more, when you play long-term stuff like this, what's fun is that each "turn" can take a long while, even in game time. For instance we once did a murder mystery investigation as a long-term EC, involving my character, and another PC. There was a third PC, however, not involved. Her character got to play "in-between" our turns. That is, we'd rotate scenes, pretty much as normal, and when you got a scene it counted as your part of the current "round" of the EC. You didn't have to participate in the EC on your round, if you didn't want to do so, you could always do some "unrelated action" if you preferred. In practice there were few of these.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is that play proceed like normal play, just with there being a contest ongoing. Which is a lot of fun. You don't have to suspend normal play to have a long-term EC, in other words. You don't have to jump forward to the end after a few rounds of die rolling. In the example in question, it took two or three sessions to play through the entire EC (I think we started half-way through one session, did the EC througout the next, and then finished in the middle of the next session, or something).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's more, the rule about not nesting contests can be suspended in this case. That is, a character on the campaign trail might get accosted at random, and end up injured after a contest roll for the fight. This wouldn't neccessarily directly affect the EC AP totals or such, but the mechanical effects of the injuries could have an effect in later rounds. You can even do ECs in the EC in this case. You could even have ECs to determine the outcome of a round, if you liked.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, you could have a debate where 10 AP are at stake overall - not enough to win the election outright (since you can't win an election in a debate), but a substantial amount, potentially. Then you play out the debate back and forth with rounds, each character using their abilities to stab at the opponent's arguments (after suitable narration), and the end result of that EC telling what AP are lost/transferred in the overall election.<br/>\n<br/>\nA key is the timing of the actual election. You don't keep track of time too closely, but always have the idea that time is passing in relative proportions to AP lost. Basically the actual election day is triggered when somebody decides to reel forward to that by bidding enough AP that on anything other than a marginal, the winner will be determined. On a marginal, the narrator can "drill down" to some election night events, and work on those until the actual winner is determined (probably on the next round).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if, in fact, somebody wins on a bid before the election day is being brought up as an action, then that simply represents them being ahead by a landslide in the polls, such that the election night is a formality.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut! Remember there's always the chance to make a comeback, if you can distract your opponent. If the polls come out and say he's won, you can stage a comeback, in theory, and still win on election night!<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74492/#Comment_74492" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T11:51:38+00:00" title="June  8, 2007 11:51AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuing...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Sophie's general criticisms of the HQ system (which really apply to all HQ contests), I can only say that I disagree with them. First, as for the AP being "passing handfuls of tokens back and forth" well the exent to which those handfuls are meaningful is the extent to which you play out the rounds in question, and how much effort you put into coming up with the augments, and how much effort is put into careful narration of the outcome. No, HQ is terrible if all you're using it for is some system meant to come up with a result, and then get out of the way. I content, in fact, that the process of HQ resolution is far, far more important than the outcomes it produces.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, you say you have limits on abilities and augments. Big mistake in my opinion. It seems likely that the thought pattern here is that we have contests just to figure out the outcomes of the contests. So you're trying to make it take less time. To me, the process of discovering the augments, the Narrator asking about how they fit, players qualifying them, or even narrating events that explain how they are pertinent... all of that is critical to the process. In seeing how the character plugs into the contest in question - in detail, not just prima facia - gives us a lot of insight into how the character deals with life, the world, whatever he comes across. It's relevatory of the character - more specifically of how the player sees the character and his abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance does the character augment in his litigation with "Lie Convincingly?" Or does he avoid that for any of several possible reasons?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the extent that you invest in this mechanical examination of things, and make it come to life in the narration, using the mechanics as inpsiration, the system is not "just passing tokens back and forth." It all has quite a lot of meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, on the issue of the d20 having lots of weight: It does, you're right. And I can't say for sure whether or not Robin Laws is that brilliant or not, to say for sure that he intended the HQ curve to work the way it does. But I can say with absolute certainty that I will never again go back to any system that caters to "good ideas" insamuch as those might be tactical ones, or trends more strongly to character abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually the HQ system does allow for benefits of "good ideas" they're called situational modifiers. If John isn't using these, then you as a group have some disconnect on when they should be used between yourselves. I suggest a chat on that subject. Chris Chinn, for instance, plays such that he gives out bonuses up to +20s regularly for what he finds as entertaining narration. Other people use the situational modifiers to introduce a more tactical game; I wouldn't do that myself, but it's an option in the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for trending more strongly to the abilities... yes, HQ is a wild system that produces very random results. From my perspective this is favoring the underdog. That is, it makes it so that the little guy (often the hero) can topple the big guy. It also means that even the most potent of folks fail regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is this good? Because knowing the result before it happens is not dramatic. Is the situation such that you don't feel that it would be interesting for your character to fail? Then the HQ rules say you should use the "Automatic Success" rules and not roll for anything that you feel that no self-respecting hero would fail at. The rules empower you here to make that decision at the dramatic level. Only roll if you're interested in possibly failing. Because you might.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you fail? So much the better! Failure in HQ gives you a penalty and probably a new goal of getting rid of that penalty. Rejoice, you've got new directions for your character. And do not fear, the HQ system can't take your character away from you, only the narrator can.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat that means is that you should go into whatever contest you feel like. There's never a time where you'd say, "Hmm, too tough, might lose." Instead you say, "Hmm, very tough. Cool, I might win, and if I lose, that's cool, too!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all made possible by the fact how the dice curve works to favor the underdog, and generally to randomize things. With augments, I've had near starting level characters overcome mighty supernatural beings that seem beyond their capabilities at first. But which they manage to overcome by the most dramatic of means, employing a ton of augments that say a lot about how important the conflict is to the character, the random dice system, and hero points all in conjunction. This makes it so that the player is always incentivized to get into conflicts, because it's a fun display of the character, and the outcome results are all good. Meaning that the most heroic things happen in HQ, and the most tragic at times, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously I'm passionate about the system. But hopefully if you see why from the above, you can tell us better what it is about the system as it stands that needs modification and why.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr just maybe you might give it a second chance. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74574/#Comment_74574" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T15:24:45+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  3:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>First, as for the AP being "passing handfuls of tokens back and forth" well the exent to which those handfuls are meaningful is the extent to which you play out the rounds in question, and how much effort you put into coming up with the augments, and how much effort is put into careful narration of the outcome.</blockquote>\nIn this instance, it's me who doesn't enjoy the tactical aspect of the game, not the system that is flawed.

I have the same problem with games like <i>Capes</i> or <i>Burning Empires</i>.

In systems where the die roll adjudicate narrative rights, and/or where stake-setting make sure both options are branches equally interesting, those allow me to say "so much the better."  But systems where the group can take a few hours setting up a scenario only to have it go bust on a fluke result of a pass/fail roll, they make me say "so much for that."  Now I figure an HQ-based system can go either way, and I'd just like to make sure it goes where I will be happy with it.  <br><br>Besides, if we have a scene where a character talks the United Generation Ship Parts-Makers Union into supporting his nomination, and one where the bikers sabotage the opopsition, and one where somebody else narrates an alien attack that will convince the public to rally behind the Church, why do we need the dice to mess that beautiful action?  <br><br>The die is a great tool to throw some opopsition at characters while maintaining a GM's ability to say "Wow, guys, it wasn't me saying no, it was the rules."  Because in our most classic games, in most gamers' first approach to gaming, we want only complete success for our beloved characters.  But in a very collaborative story game like <i>Exodus II</i>, the players (and GM) are already doing a beautiful job of throwing twists into the story, and creating difficulties for themselves or others.  Is it more exciting to have the dice say "The bomb goes off," or to have one of the players say it?  For my part, I find it a lot more thrilling when it comes from a player.<br><br>Hey, here is another mechanic idea to handle challenges: use the approach from <i><a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Wilderness_of_Mirrors" rel="nofollow">Wilderness of Mirrors</a></i> to have the players create commplications and difficulties they will have to resolve (e.g., "the Belters support Cardinal Mustapha because they have cut a deal to get the ship outbound ASAP," or "the UGSPMU rep swears she will never sit at the same table as the Association of Micro-Gravity Workers"), for which they receive action points the entire group has access to.  Also include the trust mechanic where individuals can gain trust points by betraying (or appearing to betray) other characters; they can use the trust points as their personal action points.  Then the GM starts throwing little complications in, and watches the group panic.  :-)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74580/#Comment_74580" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T15:45:40+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  3:45PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 6:52PM by johnzo.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, thanks very much for your thoughtful answer.
