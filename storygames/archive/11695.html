When an appropriately dramatic moment is reached, the GM asks the player concerned for a description as to what could happen but with a particular requirement (best case scenario, least violent outcome, if the NPC regards the PC most favourably). Then the GM asks the same player for a description of the same situation, but played out with a contrasting requirement (worst case scenario, most violent outcome, if the NPC hates the PC's guts). The GM then narrates a 'here's what actually happens', but can only include elements that appeared in one or the other of previous versions.<br/><br/>The rationale is that it puts the player in control of what happens to his character, for good or ill, but still with the GM's judgement to keep things smooth. Good ideas, even when they don't become part of the story, still get table-time. When things go badly for a PC, it's because the GM made things turn out that way- but in many cases it'll be clear to everyone at the table that the bad option was a more interesting alternative.<br/><br/>Let's say the character Inigo has finally cornered the swordsman who killed his father. The GM asks him to narrate how he's always dreamed of this moment, during his training and his long search.<br/><br/>"We draw out swords, and face one another. He bows to me, but I don't acknowledge him. In anger, he strikes first, but it becomes clear that my years of training have put me at a level far above him. In a single strike, I breeze past his defences and kill him. It's all over in less than a second."<br/><br/>Then the GM asks him how the battle has gone in his worst nightmares, when he was in the grip of the bottle.<br/><br/>"He moves so fast I can't quite see him. I block his blows, just, and put everything I have learned into play, but I cannot mark him. I use every technique I know, executing them perfectly, but he has an answer to every one. I realise, right then, that for all my skill, I cannot beat him. I can't even blame it on poor form, as there is nothing technically wrong with my attacks. He leaves me alive, and we both know I am no threat to him."<br/><br/>The GM might then describe the fight:<br/><br/>"The first few exchanges go against you. He is fast- terribly fast- and you can't quite sneak your blade past his. As you try everything you know, with mounting frustration, a feeling of hopelessness wells up within you. You break away, panting, your confidence knocked out of you. It's then that you see the drops of sweat on his forehead, and the thin red line on his cheek. His age has caught up with him, and he is running out of stamina. Your last riposte, far from being ineffective, got through far enough to score him. You go en garde again, and he seems to realise the victory will be yours eventually. He doesn't even raise his sword against your next assault, and dies quickly."<br/><br/>Although probably a lot less eloquently given the description would be off the cuff; but you get the idea.<br/><br/>Does this idea have potential? Has it been done before?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260795/#Comment_260795" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T17:05:44+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  5:05PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really neat. I wouldn't have the GM narrating: I'd either give that job to the player or to another player. <br/><br/>What I'd actually do, I think, is roll a die to see where the narration falls, between the two extremes.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260819/#Comment_260819" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T21:52:58+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  9:52PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing that I see is time.

That might keep it slimline most of the time.<br/><br/>"Give me the likeliest outcome when Inigo faces 4 guards."<br/>"Come up with a really narrow success when trying to persuade Miracle Max."<br/>"What's the most humiliating way Westley could face down Humperdink?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
