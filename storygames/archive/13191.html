It serves as the basis for generating Fronts, which provide structure to play.  But you could replace it with... hmm... Envy, perhaps (somebody is jealous of somebody else), or maybe even History (something bad shit happened before, which leads to the current problem).  Or... Lost Secrets from the Age of War before current world was born (which bubble out of the earth and cause problems).  And that would generate different kinds of Fronts which would give the game a very different feel.  I think you're right that the theme of scarcity is also embodied in the moves, but there are other ways to handle moves if you want to really hack the core principles.<br/><br/><a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2010/05/01/ghost-opera-mechanics-in-brief/" rel="nofollow">Ghost Opera</a> is basically built as a AW hack, before I'd ever seen a copy of the AW rules, I think, and it works in a slightly different way than AW.  Instead of "pick or spend" its core moves are based on "assert that you are better."  It's also diceless, but you could probably do it with dice too, if you wanted.  So, yeah, scarcity may be in the core moves of AW, but that doesn't mean you can't hack it to be different.  It just becomes "not Apocalypse World," for whatever that's worth.<br/><br/>But are you wanting to discuss what things are really baked into the system of the game, that might not be obvious to hackers?  Because that's really interesting to talk about.  I'd really love to talk about the different between the normal rolling system and the one that's used for gigs, which is pretty important, so if that's on topic, cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297123/#Comment_297123" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T03:18:35+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  3:18AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't feel like scarcity has to do anything with moves, per se. <br/><br/>Scarcity is the driving force between fronts and is involved with some of the moves (Hocus followers for example), but the whole ''choose 2 out 4'' thing is just about what's important to your character at the time.<br/><br/>I've been wondering about a way to make a horror hack for AW, but I'm having trouble figuring out what to exchange scarcity for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297124/#Comment_297124" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T03:33:27+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  3:33AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>I've been wondering about a way to make a horror hack for AW, but I'm having trouble figuring out what to exchange scarcity for.</blockquote>\nScarcity of safety and information?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297128/#Comment_297128" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T07:03:08+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  7:03AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

One player chooses, then passes it over to another player, then back, etc. Going aggro and seduce/manipulate most especially. Also, they allow for more middle ground than simple pass/fail you get all you want or you get nothing. They'll work fine in games where scarcity isn't the issue, just look at all the hacks there are.<br/><br/>Scarcity in the setting means there's no anonymous providers of stuff. In, say, the modern world, you get your water by turning on your taps. You buy stuff at a store, where you may not even have to interact with a cashier. Or you buy online, and some anonymous mail carrier drops it off. When you buy equipment in most games, it's all check a list, deduct money from character sheet.<br/><br/>In AW, everything you want to get comes from somewhere, and either you find it or make it yourself, or you have to get it from someone. And if you get it from someone, they have a name, and you have to deal with them and stuff. Your water, your food, your clothes, your medicine, your electricity (if any) your home or at least the stuff you put in it, your guns, your ammo, your cars, your gasoline. None of it is ever provided by people you can ignore like the way it works in the present.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297163/#Comment_297163" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T15:19:31+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  3:19PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2010 3:20PM by sage.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Non-obvious things not to hack away: the "fictionally important" stuff like Gangs, Hardholds, Cars. There's a great thread on this on the AW forums, but the basic idea is: the fictional effectiveness (saying stuff about the setting) and mechanical effectiveness (badass moves) are in a sort of balance. Trying to design with only one of those variables (like I did in early Dungeon World) is a mistake.<br/><br/>Edit: Okay, maybe not a mistake but something to be cautious about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297168/#Comment_297168" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T16:03:22+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  4:03PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gigs are kinda like what Sage said, too, actually.  Part of the point of them, along with things like Workspaces, is that there should be multiple ways to mechanically deal with the same thing.  AW definitely has a series of overlapping mechanical systems.  Like, if you want to kill someone, we can play that out action by action. Or you can roll for Doing Murders. Or you can just say "I shoot that dude in the back of the head" and the GM might say "Okay, his brains fly out his face."  Or you can try to come up with a complex plan for killing the local hardholder and the GM might say, "Okay, you're going to need 1) planning time, 2) information about when and where he will be, 3) a good place to snipe him from, and 4) a solid getaway plan.  If you have all those, you can just do it, and maybe Act Under Fire where the fire is unexpected friction."  There's probably more too.  Like you could write a custom move for assassinating NPCs, either generally or a specific move for a specific character.  Or, to achieve similar fictional ends, you could pay some badass a few Barter to kill that fucker.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of hacks that look much more streamlined, where there's pretty much 1 or 2 ways to do most things.  That's cool if it fits what you're trying to do with the game, but people should recognize that it changes the game significantly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297171/#Comment_297171" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T16:31:59+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  4:31PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Walton, it seems like most of the examples you listed are more on the MC side, yeah? Action by action and Doing Murders are things the player can say, everything else is on the MC side: being honest to the world (brains blown out), a combination of offering an opportunity and telling possible consequences (plan).<br/><br/>I see your point, but I feel like that sits more on the MC side where it tells you what to do when everyone looks at you to say something. There's certainly some overlap, but mostly because some moves like the Workspace stuff are designed to let you get stuff done you might not otherwise be able to, and are deliberately open ended. It's not like there's a lot of moves for killing someone, there's one move for that (Seizing their life by force), but there are a lot of moves that are open ended and can do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297181/#Comment_297181" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T19:14:42+00:00" title="October 17, 2010  7:14PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see what you're saying, Sage, but we're already talking about hacking AW, right?  I'm not talking so much about how AW moves work, but pointing out that the underlying AW mechanics offer the MC (and potentially the players as well, if you write moves that allow them access) a variety of methods for handling the same narrative action (i.e. in this example, assassinating a dude).  If you dig into the guts of AW to hack it, you should realize that you have all those mechanics, at the very least, to plug into (in addition to whatever newfangled mechanics you make up) when crafting moves and such.<br/><br/>Or, maybe it's easier to say it this way: if you're writing a "when you assassinate a dude..." move for you hack, you can do it in multiple ways...<br/>-- have it just happen ("...say his name and he dies in the next 24 hours");<br/>-- tell them to use existing moves but take +1 forward or +2 to Read results or something;<br/>-- tell them to treat it like a Gig;<br/>-- have them roll a specific move and read results / pick options ("...on a 10+, XYZ, on a 7-9...");<br/>-- base it on Workspace, where you have to make a plan and gather materials / advantages;<br/>-- tell them to pay Barter;<br/>-- etc.<br/><br/>And, furthermore, when a player addresses a specific narrative assertion to the MC (i.e. "I go assassinate him"), the MC can potentially reach into the same bag of goodies in figuring out how to engage the mechanics to make that happen, because that's just crafting a custom move on the spot, right?  I guess I'm trying to say that the core system of AW is surprisingly robust and flexible, in practice.  It's really cool to write a new move that really nails a particular action, but sometimes that may not be appropriate or feel right in play and AW gives you other things to reach for in those instances.<br/><br/>Does that make more sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297187/#Comment_297187" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-17T22:05:52+00:00" title="October 17, 2010 10:05PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, Jonathan, I think you're trying to say that there's no one single core system in AW.<br/><br/>There's the die mechanic, sure, but you can take the Workspace rules out and make a whole game out of them.

On the AW forum, Barf Forth Apocalyptica, Vincent talks a lot about the different unbalanced parts of the game a lot.  <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=132.0" rel="nofollow">The Battlebabe</a>, for example, breaks a lot of the principles he followed when designing the other classes (the sex move is a good example, but there are many others). Also, the stat block choices for the different classes aren't strictly balanced, plus there are some really interesting or valuable stat spreads that just aren't options for specific character classes.  There's also the way that gangs, followers, holdings, and crews all are kinda similar but operate very differently in practice.  There's no move for wrangling your crew or followers and getting them to do stuff, for example (unlike Pack Alpha or Leadership). The Hocus has to try to use Speak Truth To a Mob, which actually isn't follower-specific and can be used on any mob, so that's pretty different. The Operator gets nothing. Pack Alpha and Leadership are themselves pretty different.  Another good example is the way different characters access Augury, with the Saavyhead getting it as an addition to their Workspace, to be used any time, while the Hocus has to roll+Fortunes at the beginning of the session and might get it or might not.<br/><br/>All of these differences and unbalanced bits are a part of the overlapping systems and robustness that I was talking about earlier.  They make for interesting constraints and interesting choices, both in play, since they can be used for different things and have different idiosyncratic limitations, and when choosing new moves.  If everything was more or less the same, the game would seem clean and pretty and straightforward instead of messy. As things are, people often have to make do with moves that don't quite allow them to do what they want without consequences or striving hard (because what fun would that be?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297681/#Comment_297681" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T14:08:55+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  2:08PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Non-obvious things not to hack away: the "fictionally important" stuff like Gangs, Hardholds, Cars.

The basic moves don't have anything to do with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my eyes, there should be a slight difference between those two: sure, every kind of move (roll and choose, hold, stuff just happens, stuff happens off-screen, workspace-like rules) can be represented in both character and custom moves, but there's more room among the character moves for "moves" that aren't really moves, like "you get another car" and "you roll +x instead of +y when doing z".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297766/#Comment_297766" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T09:38:46+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  9:38AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a big, big toolbox of moves in AW.

'm pretty sure it says right in the book that moves have variable time and scale, and 'I lay waste to your kingdom with my armies' and 'I punch you in the face' could both very well be seizing by force, right? In the first example, you've got a huge-ass gang (your armies) and what your seizing is the security of the kingdom (in other words, laying waste). In the latter, you've got yourself and your fist, and what you're seizing is his face.<br/><br/>Maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301816/#Comment_301816" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T22:41:58+00:00" title="November 22, 2010 10:41PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kinda, yeah, because you can seize by force with your gang (or army).

It's great, the whole "wade in and damn the consequences" thing.<br/><br/>But..."seizing" is maddeningly vague. I end up doing what John's done, which is to push players into Go Aggro in any case where behavior modification is the goal. I've pretty much given up on trying to be evenhanded in what you can and cannot "seize", and keep it literal: grab the guy's gun (but why wouldn't you just go aggro and demand they drop it?), seize control over something (a vehicle or base or whatever, if I want to back the camera off and just get on to the next scene). So, yeah, in agreement with John here.<br/><br/>But like ... seize someone's life? Um no. Because how are you supposed to reconcile "take definite hold of it" and just doing harm? Does "definite hold" mean they're just dead? That's pretty definite.

On a 7-9, choose one:<br/><i>- You exchange blows. You and your opponent both inflict harm as established.<br/>- You seize an advantageous opportunity. Take +1forward.<br/>- You force your opponent back and disengage for a moment.<br/>- You detect a weakness in your opponent\u2019s defense. Do +1harm when you next inflict harm on them.<br/>- You improve your defensive posture. Take +1armor during the next exchange.<br/>- You change the fighting distance, terrain, or nature of the contest (from swordplay in the hall to close grappling on the balcony, for instance)</i><br/><br/>On a miss, the GM may inflict harm on you as established, choose two from the list above for your opponent, or make some other hard move.<br/><br/>----------<br/><br/>This is for a more nitty-gritty action game, but I think it addresses the issues with seize fairly well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cathexis" title="cathexis"><img alt="cathexis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cathexis">cathexis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302198/#Comment_302198" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T15:41:32+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  3:41PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, Go Aggro starts fights and Seize by Force comes out once the fight has started.  The way I think about it is that Go Aggro is the threat of violence: you want someone to drop their gun, or go away, or give up their position, but you haven't started actually shooting yet.  If you Go Aggro and mess up your roll, the only way you're going to dislodge people is by bringing violence to them via Seize by Force.  You can't Go Aggro on someone, fail, and then do it again, but you can Go Aggro on someone, fail, and resort to Plan B (kill everyone).  <br/><br/>Go Aggro is the Plan A move, Seize by Force is definitely the Plan B move, but I think it's still relevant enough to be in the basic moves list, even if it doesn't get used as often as Go Aggro or Act Under Fire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302199/#Comment_302199" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-24T15:49:36+00:00" title="November 24, 2010  3:49PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see it that way, Colin.

It's the specific context of what you're doing that matters.<br/><br/>Also, go aggro can specifically be used to simply attack/kill someone.

Given those odds, taking some harm seems a bargain.<br/><br/>Second, the move is much better if you don't use one of those metaphorical things--"his life", etc.  No, seize something more useful--especially if you have a nice big gun and the other guy is probably dead anyway.
