Otherwise it all becomes a big mess with too many people trying to talk about too many thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, over in the The Forge's Winter Phase thread, Peter asked about games that support Right to Dream. His last post was:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: PeterBB</cite><a href="/forums/profile/David">@David</a>:<br/><br/>I was mostly talking about games that actively support RTD play, like a lot of games actively support Story Now play. Both in the sense of "what games are there?" and in the sense of "what are good techniques for making such a game?". I can point you to lots of good Story Now-supporting games, and tell you how they support theme, and passionate characters in untenable situations, and whatever else. I can't do that with RTD. I'm wondering if I've just missed the conversation, or if this is a common problem.</blockquote>\nI don't think you've missed the conversation, because I haven't seen any real talk about this either. I think that there are many reasons for this, but I wouldn't call it a problem. More of a simple oversight.<br/><br/>First of all, I'll just explain how I understand RtD, if you disagree, maybe we should figure that out first. I know a lot of people read RtD as "exploration squared" - all games are about Exploration (setting, colour, characters, situation, system) but RtD is somehow double that. I'm not buying that definition. I think "emulation" is much closer, but still not quite on target. <br/>"Right to Dream" as the name for the agenda was chosen for a reason. It emphasizes the <i>right</i> and the <i>dream</i>. The dream is the fiction and its specific functions, elements and contents. Right means that the dream is of prime importance in this agenda. To protect the dream (and out right to it) we will fudge dice, eschew dramatic decisions, win (or lose) fights regardless of skill. <br/><br/>If there is a challenge or contest (Step on Up) it <b>probably</b> takes second stage to "getting it right": the outcome is probably consensually known, and we aren't interested in showing our skill, merely affirming what we know should happen. If the dice speak against that, we'll discard them.<br/><br/>If there is a real, actual dramatic decision with consequences to be made (Story Now), we <b>might</b> shy away from it, because it would mean turning off the GPS and making a blind turn.<br/><br/>In Vincent's words it's about keeping certain things about the fiction sacrosanct. It's about affirmation ("this is how it should be") and constructive denial ("I don't want that to happen") and the right to have those claims fulfilled. K?<br/><br/>So, because of these traits of RtD, there are lots of games that can do it. The second reason is that most designers working with CA aren't really interested in pursuing this agenda. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I'm thinking aloud now, trying to identify ways to do RtD with certain games. I might surprise myself along the way.<br/><br/>I think FATE and GURPS can both do pretty good RtD. I wouldn't say they actively support it, but they can support it. I think FATE is enough of a toolkit that you can easily use it for Step on Up play, too, and it's certainly possible to do some Story Now with it. But the way Fate points work, that's a collaborative method of giving people the Right. It depends on the people playing, <i>obviously</i>, but it can be used for this purpose. Paying, compelling, invoking etc. are ways of saying "I want this to happen" and "I don't want this to happen". FATE works well as RtD when the group is collectively using Fate points to enforce a certain tone, genre, archetype or story. When we play StoC, we use points to say "this belongs in pulp". What FATE is missing, maybe, is a way to explicitly say "this doesn't belong", except when you refuse a compel. <br/><br/>I think GURPS on the other hand is very much about keeping Setting and its specific Colour sacrosanct, as opposed to characters or narrative. If we pick up the GURPS WW2 book, we're probably saying "we want to play it <i>like it was</i>". The world, with all its realities, is sacrosanct. This has nothing to do with the rules simulating ingame physics or anything like that, but saying "this is how it was, this is how it should be, this is how it is", the numerous setting books and optional rules help you include or exclude things. Character building also offers lots and lots of options on how to build your specific gal or dude, but it takes second stage to setting. GURPS is pre-agenda design, but if it has any agenda is getting the world/setting right, which can certainly be RtD play.<br/><br/>Next on, I take a peek at Archipelago II. There are things in the game that are very much about challenging the other players' dreams: for example, if I make my character a pacifist, the game advises the other players to make my character shoot a guy by the end of the session - this means that I don't have the right to dream my character as a pacifist. In this instance, the game is hostile to my specific dream. But.<br/>Once the other players create a fate for my character (shoot a guy), we know it's pretty much going to happen. There's a certain level of group consensus going on here about what should happen and how the story should go.<br/>Furthermore, Archipelago has two powerful tools/rules at its disposal: <b>"Describe that in more detail"</b> and <b>"Try another way"</b>. If we were using only these two, without relying on other rules, Archipelago could be a powerful (if simplistic) RtD engine. Describe that in more detail = I want this in my game, I want more of it, Try another way = this doesn't fit into my/our dream.<br/><br/>Moreno also mentioned A Taste for Murder and It's Complicated. Sadly, I own neither game, so I can't really dig deep. But I know a little more about A Taste for Murder, so I'm going to look at that. What A Taste for Murder does, what "it's all about" is emulating Agatha Christie-type murder mysteries. Sure, there might be a competitive element (I know Graham put a certain dice mechanic in where you can compete with another player), but it's not the point, it's more of a fun aside (I think). Maybe finding the murderer could be a "win condition", if you're inclined to play that way, I dunno. It could be story now, because it certainly has characters with passions in hard situations, but we all know what will happen, don't we? No meaningful conflict, the result of "escalation" is clear. So what the game does, really does, is keep the functions of the whodunit narrative sacrosanct. There are three acts, people are fucked up, there's a murder, etc. This is what we want and expect when we read Christie, this is what you get when you play ATFM. I think it's telling that some actual play reports describe a failed game because people were not familiar with the source material: they weren't on board with the dream, they weren't really sure about what was right and what was wrong for this kind of story.<br/><br/>I think David's game <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">Delve</a> is also a very strong, if not the best example, that's why I'm leaving it for last. There's no other resolution than agreement, common sense and judgement calls. When it fits, we include it, when it doesn't we throw it away. The game was certainly explicitly built to support this agenda.<br/><br/><br/>So, that's me. Interested in what other people think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299704/#Comment_299704" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T02:39:59+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  2:39AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are definitely some good "genre sim" games out there. Fiasco and InSpectres also come to mind. I think this is probably the most developed subcategory of RTD, when it comes to games that support it. <br/><br/>I don't know what it's intended to be, but Houses of the Blooded seems like it would work best as RTD. The thing that is inviolable in this case is the culture and its norms. (I have quibbles about how successful it is, but I think it's definitely trying.) This is a subcategory that interests me, are there any other games that are doing similar things?<br/><br/>Universalis is really good for RTD play. It enforces certain narrative conventions, and directly provides tools for affirmation and constructive denial. It makes the players do most of the work, but it gives them the tools they need to do it.<br/><br/>There are also a bunch of games that provide useful tools for RTD, even if they are more directly intended to be Story Now. All of Vincent Baker's games work this way for me. (Certain statements in DitV made no sense until I realized that I was playing it very differently from the way Vincent does.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299707/#Comment_299707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T03:10:24+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  3:10AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are all great examples. <br/><br/>I think the key thing to realize here is that game texts can ever only support an agenda up to a degree. Agenda is still about instances of play.<br/><br/>There are definitely things that sound very Right to Dream-y in Vincent's games. Poison'd for example, is very strict about emulating its pirate fiction, but that doesn't mean it's RtD at all. In fact, if anything it supports SN play, but I think you could even play it as a SoU. Certain games fight you when you play them with an agenda that wasn't intended, or fall flat. Dogs certainly is a boring game if you're playing it SoU. I always get bruises when I try furthering a SN agenda with D&amp;D as opposed to SoU. D&amp;D can also do RtD, but I always get bored to hell.<br/><br/>I'm thinking now about what the fruitful void in RtD is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299720/#Comment_299720" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T06:38:27+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  6:38AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chronica Feudalis seems pretty ripe for RtD play - the very game text is "in character", and there's a lot of detail put into devising how various sorts of conflict work differently from each other, with little fiddly bits here and there (social conflict rules recommend three different options for attack, two for defense, and why). <br/><br/>Now, it's certain to me that the game is not exactly primed for SoU - the Knight is clearly the very best mentor possible, sporting the only d20 tool on the list (his noble steed). Granted, there's room for maximizing advantage (doubling or tripling up a skill by getting all three mentors with the same ability/abilities), but there are enough barriers to immediate optimization that you'd have to mess around with the game to make it suitable for that. <br/><br/>It seems adequate for SN play, but there's an element of "if you've GMed before, you'll just know what to do" going on, at least in the Red Knight edition. Once you get going, it seems easy enough to use Aspects as clues for good bangs, but you have to talk pretty explicitly with the players to get them to tell you what they're interested in. <br/><br/>Fascinatingly, when you endure an Aspect or a Tool in Chronica, it seems to be a matter of getting causality right - for Aspects, the player is tasked with tracking any Aspects that might negatively affect him, and in exchange for being a good scout about it, any concretely negative Aspects give 1 Ardor each. For Tools, the GM is encouraged to bring in one Tool you possess that hinders you - examples of heavy armor (for swimming) and bloody weapons (for social conflict; you scary!) are mentioned. In exchange for this equipment problem, you get 1 Ardor. <br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what to make of the Endure rules - I like them, but what are they trying to do? Since you're being compensated for your trouble, it's not just about getting it "right" - otherwise, you'd gladly take the penalty for the sake of It Makes Sense. But if you take the penalty, you're better equipped to do other sorts of things, and you get a bit more narrative control, to boot. I suppose that's Chronica's equivalent of a nestled merit/flaw system; it's reminiscent of the one in Nobilis, which is abundantly RtD - you are compensated when your pc's flaws are relevant, instead of taking a few extra character points at the beginning and then ignoring your Broken Heart the whole game.<br/><br/>Nobilis, now - - the GM has final say on how everything goes, and is ... sorry, replace GM with <i>Hollyhock God</i>. See? Very "getting it right"! Anyway, the other major facet of Nobilis is that a good deal of play, especially a good deal of using your Miracles, revolves around debating with the play group what you could reasonably achieve, given Miracle type X and your character's Word (their domain, their concept, which informs all Miracles they can create). <br/><br/>For instance, I debated for several minutes with an opposed PC and the GM... sorry, HG... about whether my Word, "Family", could be used to get nuclear particles to stay friends, and thus head off an imminent nuclear detonation. Granted this sort of thing is how SECOND edition plays out; in Third, it sounds like your ability to perform Miracles is greatly enhanced if you're performing them for or on a relationship your character possesses, thus clearly making use of content-preference flags. <br/><br/>Good stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299726/#Comment_299726" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T07:20:07+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  7:20AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like RtD mechanics would necessitate, what's the word, "GMful" play (everyone is GM) or some other shared narration schema.

And I wouldn't call it dysfunctional as such. Now, if player has Dream X and GM has Dream Y, and they don't talk about it, problems! But I am 99,9% certain that there are many groups out there where the players are present just to participate in the GM's Dream, and they enjoy it. This method of play is very dependent on the quality of the GM as a storyteller and the player's consent to enjoy this (it's what you did in most adventure videogames and do in most CRPGs anyway, so not why at the table, right?). <br/><br/>I would say your regular game of D&amp;D where the players save the village/kingdom/world by following the breadcrumb trail and the DM just fudges dice if anything goes wrong (like a character accidentally dying) is a pretty functional example of RtD, and it's obvious the players don't have any real power. It falls apart the moment someone doesn't buy into the GM's scheme but it works (it's not like a SN game can fall apart if someone starts kicking doors in, or a SoU game drag to a halt when a character starts talking to his girlfriend instead of kicking the door it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299740/#Comment_299740" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T08:13:08+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  8:13AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that the main faultline of Right to Dream play is the need for consensus about what the "dream" is.

The first is exactly how you say: The GM leaves bread-crumbs, the PCs blow things up. I played a pretty fun game of that style recently, and I got to be an incredibly intimidating guy who did things like bend darkness to create a staircase for himself. It was awesome. (Edit: The crucial thing here is to leave space for the players' contributions. We knew where we were going and who we were killing, the fun was in finding awesome ways to have our characters kill them. We had a decent number of cool and different powers, and the GM did a good job of describing pretty open situations, so we had a lot of room to make it interesting.)<br/><br/>But more interesting to me is the old-school sandbox model. The GM gets to describe "the background", and the PCs get to decide what they want to do. My most recent Apocalypse World game went approximately that way, although I followed the text's rules about getting player input into the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299774/#Comment_299774" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T10:57:01+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 10:57AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 10:58AM by Vernon R.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the ways that games have typically supported RTD play is that it guides you on how play will develop in the future, gives you a path for where to go with the game.  D&amp;D; (at least pre 4th) was easy to drift towards RTD play because it gave that very specific zero to hero experience and people would modify that to suit their purpose by changing what experience points were given out for.  Gurps works in a very similar way with it's character points showing how the world works, how peopel grow and become better, on top of providing the mechanics for how the physical world works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion Universalis doesnt give you that, it doesnt prescribe a way to play and how play will advance long term.  It's really a toolbox for exploration which can be bent in any direction, RTD, step-on-up, or story-now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299777/#Comment_299777" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T11:07:18+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 11:07AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 11:13AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's an interesting question, right?  Which texts "support" RTD play kinda depends on what support you you need!<br><br>I have a friend who really looks for strength of aesthetic for inspiration.  To him, <b>Vampire: the Masquerade</b> is the best RTD product ever.  I'm sure he'd dig <b>Call of Cthulhu</b> too.<br/><br/>Other friends most need a compelling character concept and consequential ways to express it.  The list of games that make cool characters is as long as the number of tastes on "what's cool".  I'll just throw out <b>Cyberpunk</b> and <b>Marvel Superheroes</b> as examples.  As for consequential expression, a lot of the classic fighty team games provide minimal support, tempting folks to drift Narr games instead.  E.g., Burning Wheel has a really clear way to show "here's what my guy cares about!" -- the only problem is that it's <i>so</i> important that it's never intended to come in second to any aesthetic package.<br/><br/>I think <b>Pendragon</b> does a good job of coolness + consequence.  And hey, clerics and Paladins in <b>D&amp;D2</b> are great opportunities to link personality, belief, and badassery.<br/><br/>Other players need support for situation.  "We've got a vibe and cool characters, but what do we <i>do</i>?"  In emulation games, it's often easy enough for the GM to say, "What gets the characters off their butts in <b>Star Wars</b>?  Okay, <i>that</i> happens."  But in a game that strives to run a simulation of "What would have happened at the battle of Leningrad if the Nazis had a djinn?" it's easy to get lost.  Relationship Maps are one solution; it works nicely in <b>How We Came to Live Here</b>.<br/><br/>Of course, there's system.  You can't run a "what would happen?" simulation with a broken physics engine.  You can quantify every imaginable aspect of the fiction, like <b>GURPS</b>, or rely on player plausibility judgments, like <b>Delve</b>.  And, for those groups trying to emulate a genre, but not wanting to strain the GM's creativity to pull it off, there are systems like <b>Dead of Night</b>, where the logic of resolution mirrors the plot direction of horror cinema.  Or <b>Trail of Cthulhu</b>, which adds some tools for pacing and story progress onto Call's aesthetics and physics.<br/><br/>Finally, there's color.  <b>Sign in Stranger</b> works for me largely because every development in play is a weird creative moment delivered exclusively to the characters' senses.<br/><br/>Adam, I really want to play Universalis!  Would you consider running it at Dreamation?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299783/#Comment_299783" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T11:22:31+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 11:22AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>shared narration is just introducing additional chances for failure points.

Story Now is a good phrase-fit for Narrativism.  Step on Up is a good phrase-fit for Gamism.  But Right to Dream is bloody awful as a phrase-fit for Simulationism.  Largely because I think the inventor of the phrase understood Simulationism least well of the three.  <br/><br/>I think Right to Dream discussions have confounded 2 very seperate impulses into one label, a label that seems to justify containing both impulses.<br/><br/>Gregor you cite one of those impulses in your OP in your explanatio of Right to Dream, where you note "To protect the dream (and our right to it) we will fudge dice, eschew dramatic decisions, win (or lose) fights regardless of skill."<br/><br/>The other impulse is what I consider to be the actual Simulationist Impulse.  I find your description of Right to Dream to include what is often meant by the phrase RtD...but I find it completely incompatable (I'd say even diametrically opposed to) Simulationism.  <br/><br/>Simulationism is inherently dynamic.  To be simulationist play you have to be willing to let go of your starting assumptions and follow play where it leads.  You don't force play to lead to dramatic decisions, but you'd also never eschew them should they arise organically.  You don't fudge dice just because you don't like result, but neither are your decisions driven by min maxing the mechanics.  You recognize the mechanics as being the "impartial hand of the universe" (ideally optimized to for the universe you are simulating) and let the chips fall where they may.  <br/><br/>A better phrase-fit for Simulationism would be "What would it be like", which I've often shortened to "What if" as in "What would it be like to play an exhiled Elf Lord in Tolkien's Middle Earth" and "What if this Elf knew a secret that would greatly aid the Fellowship but no one would trust him due his past".  I've likened Simulationism to a wind up toy.  Getting the set up just right is essential (like setting up a chemistry experiment) but then you have to let play run its course as it happens (again much like a chemistry experiment).<br/><br/>If John Kim is reading this, this is why I think alot of his AP reports sound very Nar compatable...because he sets up an initial situation that seems likely to lead to dramatically interesting decision points...but after play starts, it may or may not hit those points as play follows through the logical chain of cause an effect of the universe.  <br/><br/>The reason I find this sort of play largely incompatable with the Right to Dream, is because the Dream in such play is not what's sacrosanct.  In true Simulationist Star Wars play it would be completely acceptable for Luke Skywalker to die while failing to blow up the Death Star...thereby completely altering the "Dream" of what play in that Universe will look like from that point forward.<br/><br/><br/>Interestingly, for my own formulation of this portion of the Big Model, I put what you've described as the Right to Dream at the Exploration level and defined it as pure explanation without any further Creative Agenda.  I.e. Exploration sans any trace of Story Now, Step on Up, or What If.  So in away...it does become "Exploration Squared".  i.e. Exploration with a Creative Agenda of more Exploration.  Which is consistant with how the Right to Dream is described in the Big Model, but not compatable with what I believe the actual Simulationist agenda really should be.<br/><br/>*Gregor, I'd love to hear more about the perceived inadequacy of Right to Dream as Exploration Squared, as that's where my formulation puts it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299830/#Comment_299830" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T14:10:16+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  2:10PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 2:12PM by Vernon R.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the problem I see with "what if" play.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you decide what the chances of anything happening are?  So you take Luke Skywalker and put him out there against the Death star, how do you decide if he succeeds or fails?  Typically you make up a type of physics engine set of rules that help you determine what happens.  But how do you determine what the chances of anything happening are?  What criteria do you use to determine how likely he will be able to perform this maneuver, dodge tie fighters, hit the exhaust port?  How much does his ability to "use the force" increase his chances?   Take those same questions and remove the Luke Skywalker name and fill in random PC, how good should he be at those tasks and should he be that good at them now or will he develop into that type role.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanics you use to model that universe are going to vary greatly depending on how you answer those questions, and different groups will answer the questions differently,  but whatever you use will create a concept that the game is about, that is pretty much the dream that the slogan RTD is referencing.  Is it a gritty world with useless characters who fail all the time or is it a game of heros who destroy the opposition every time out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Gregor spoke of with fudging dice is one aspect of the other part of the slogan, getting the dream right but what you speak of here is another just as valid interpretation of getting it right sticking with what the mechanics give you.  In Ron's Sim essay those two aspects would probably match pretty closely to High Concept vs. Purist for System.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299834/#Comment_299834" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T14:26:46+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  2:26PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Valamir, I really don't have time right now, but I'll just say this: I don't think Right to Dream and Simulationism are the same at all.

For instance, as I've remarked a number of times (and I think I've seen Jason Morningstar say also) sim play is often the most compatable with free form play, which only fits Ron's Purist for System definition if you squint at it really hard.<br><br>Establishing that "physics engine" as you put it (crunchy or free form) is part of the set up of the initial experiment, which of course is crucial, but sim play goes beyond genre tourism.  It is every bit as deliberate and proactive a form of play as Nar or Gam.  I don't think the Big Model formulation correctly captures this aspect of it by a long shot.<br><br>But at any rate, I've hammered that nail a number of times before.<br><br>I bring it up again here, because what texts are good at supporting Right to Dream play really depends on which impulse is being discussed.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299837/#Comment_299837" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T14:33:44+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  2:33PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 8, 2010 2:37PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ralph,<br/><br/>I hear ya on taking the CA types from "G + N + Other" to "G + N + What if? + Other".

I can't remember the label that was suggested (Dramatism perhaps)...IIRC it related to a big discussion on the difference between Sim games (along the lines of how I've described them here) vs. Theatrix which at the time was challenging the threefold to find a place to put it.

As in, you get all stirred up from taking your exploration into territory that's compelling and powerful, and are far less concerned with "being there" or "winners and losers". <br/>Nar play is actually inherently destructive, or at least transformative, of/to the situation and setting. It's all about untenable situations and relationships, with many possible values for "untenable". <br/>My experience with Sim (for want of a better term, obv) is that the players come together to clarify some kind of subject matter, like in Nobilis, which I now affectionately call "Debate Club". Alternately, in the case of Vampire, it's more like Exploration^2 - - the "getting it right" is all about enjoying someone else's fiction, someone else's really involved world and such. <br/>There are different types of Gamist and Nar play; why not different sorts of Sim, too? <br/>I guess the commonality between Nobilis and Vampire is that Moses still has his revelation to deliver from on high; but in one game, you're Moses, in another, you're the Israelites, and, for comedy's sake, in yet another game you're the golden calf (sorry, had to complete the analogy). You're either deciding What the Truth Is, or you're having it revealed to you. This is why, no doubt, a lot of older Sim designs are extremely GM-centric (as opposed to GMful. You know what I mean): one, sole bearer of Correctness for the genre or subject matter or what have you.<br/><br/>I'm looking at my phrasing around the whole Moses thing, and I want to make it absolutely clear that I am cool with Sim. It's not my favorite mode of play, but yeah.

Except for the wind up part.<br/><br/>In the thread <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13307&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow"> I Have No Words &amp; I Must Design... RPG Toys = Bad Design?</a>, Simulationism became crystal clear to me for the first time. (Of course, whether my view of it is valid or matches that of others is yet to be determined. And, I'm keeping an open mind. But, for now, it is clear to me nonetheless.)<br/><br/>IMO, the degree to which an RPG is a toy is the degree to which the game is Simulationist.  A toy is some construct that can be fiddled with in a variety of ways, but does not provide the player with a purpose.  Once the player decides for himself what he is going to do with the toy, suddenly it becomes a game.  If an RPG supports play where the players determine the goals rather than the game itself, then it is a Simulationist game.  If a game completely lacks a goal, then it is not a game at all, but a toy.  And that is why it has been so hard to nail down exactly what Simulationism<i> is</i>.  We are always talking about Simulationism in terms of a game, and what the player goals are within that framework.  But, that's the wrong way to look at it.  In my opinion, a good Simulationist RPG is one that supports a wide array of player goals independent of any goals the game itself may impose.<br/><br/>I also think that this is why Pathfinder has been so successful.  D&amp;D 4e is a game that is very focused on Step-on-Up tactical play, and does a very good job at that.  In the transition from v3.5, though, this focus on Gamist play lost 4e much of the toy aspects of previous editions.  Players wanting to set their own goals rebelled, and are sticking with v3.5 and Pathfinder.<br/><br/>According to this viewpoint, the most Simulationist RPG I can think of at the moment is Universalis.  From what I can tell, Universalis is actually a toy.  It has mechanics that you can fiddle with to introduce facts into a world, add new rules into the "game", and resolve conflicts, but the game (or toy) itself does not impose a goal on the players.  (I can't find my copy atm, but that's my recollection.)  Of course, the players can introduce their own goals, and thereby make their own play into a game.  As I remember, when my friends and I played several years ago, I was absolutely amazed at the richness and depth of the world we created together with it.  We started out knowing that our goal was to create a world, and, by golly, the system did an awesome job at helping us do that.  And then, once we got to the point of having the characters actually do something, the play suddenly fell flat.  We didn't know what to do.  I suppose we had the abstract goal of creating a good story, but we were very new to story games at the time and just didn't have a clue about how to go about it.  So, we didn't know we should create a premise and then have each of the scenes address that premise in some way.  I'm sure if we had known that, then play would have been a lot smoother.  As it was, we just sort of fumbled around with the toy for a while (in essence kicking the ball back and forth between each other with no real purpose) and then just stopped playing it after a while when we got bored.<br/> <br/>I've been wrong many times before, and I might be now.  But, this idea just seems right to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299918/#Comment_299918" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T21:00:18+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  9:00PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, don't all RPGs require you to create your own goals?

You can bounce it.  You can throw it and catch it.  You can spin it on your finger.  If you have several of them, you can juggle them.  However, once you decide you want to throw it through a hoop to score points, and your friends are going to do likewise with the side getting the most points being declared the victor, you now have a game.  The mechanics of an RPG are analogous to bouncing, throwing, catching, spinning, and juggling.  Individually, they provide no goal, but they do describe to the players what you can do with the toy.<br/><br/>Of course, most RPGs are enough "toy" that they allow some player-defined goals.  In this, some games are obviously more flexible than others.  But, just as a Raggedy Ann doll is a poor toy to use in playing basketball, most RPGs are poor at supporting some player-defined goals and good at supporting others.<br/><br/>As an extreme example at the other end of the spectrum from Universalis, My Life with Master pretty much excludes any player-defined goals.  The goal of the game is explicitly stated: overthrow the master.  All of the rules drive the players toward that end goal.  As such, My Life with Master is very un-toy-like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299925/#Comment_299925" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T22:40:06+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 10:40PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

Outside of those constraints either can also be a toy (Simulationist).  The degree to which that is true depends on the game.  As such, I believe most RPGs have significant toy-like aspects.<br/><br/>In Sorcerer, players have a great deal of flexibility in their high-level goals, as long as they continue to address the premise of the game via Humanity.  I've never actually played Sorcerer, but I don't think it is an absolute that the players must restrict themselves to exploring the relationship map set up by the GM. To the extent that players can set their own goals within the framework of exploring the relationship map, and to set them independent from the relationship map entirely, the game is a toy.  That leaves a lot of leeway, I believe.  (And, actually looking at the text of the game, I don't see relationship maps explicitly referenced, although I know Ron has talked about them many times.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299932/#Comment_299932" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T23:51:28+00:00" title="November  8, 2010 11:51PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Kirk</cite>In the thread<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13307&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow">I Have No Words &amp; I Must Design...

To me (as a player) the point of RPGing is "Being an Elf". I consider a good session to be one where I really had the feeling of "being there", and a memorable session is one where my Elf did something particularly memorable (so Story After, in exactly the same way it happens in real life, with the caveat that the average RPG character's life involves a lot more conflict than mine).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299936/#Comment_299936" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T00:07:09+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 12:07AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Like, I dunno, does Sorcerer start as a toy and then become a game when players finish their Kickers and the GM finishes his R-Map?</blockquote>\nI think what John's saying is that since Sorcerer gives you the structure of Kicker--&gt;Bang--&gt;...--&gt;Resolved Kicker then it's definitely not a toy.

What was left was a big hole, and people were trying to find something in there that could be constructed as a constructive, creative agenda. The name of that agenda is Right to Dream, and it has been initially defined by Ron's essay, and later developed further. Ron's essay is not scripture, it was just the first step.<br/>Simulationism is not defined in the scope of Creative Agenda. I know it <b>was</b> the name early on, but it was subsequently dropped. "Sim" should refer to the old GDS. When we're talking about the big model, Right to Dream is the correct phrase. Likewise, I personally find Narrativism to be a wholly confusing and wrong term for Story Now play. I think it doesn't describe Story Now at all. So, let's forget GNS.<br/><br/>And if we're talking about GDS "simulationism", that's something else entirely, yeah?<br/><br/>Furthermore...\n<blockquote>The other impulse is what I consider to be the actual Simulationist Impulse. I find your description of Right to Dream to include what is often meant by the phrase RtD...but I find it completely incompatable (I'd say even diametrically opposed to) Simulationism. <br/><br/>Simulationism is inherently dynamic. To be simulationist play you have to be willing to let go of your starting assumptions and follow play where it leads. You don't force play to lead to dramatic decisions, but you'd also never eschew them should they arise organically. You don't fudge dice just because you don't like result, but neither are your decisions driven by min maxing the mechanics. You recognize the mechanics as being the "impartial hand of the universe" (ideally optimized to for the universe you are simulating) and let the chips fall where they may. </blockquote>\nI would need more info but what you describe sounds to me like either functional old-school zilchplay (agenda-less) or Right to Dream that favours the setting. You say the mechanics need to be "ideally optimized for the universe you are simulating". Ok, great, let's say the universe is one of superheroes, or perhaps Alice in Wonderland? Then if the mechanics don't "simulate" that experience you will throw them out of the window, or fudge, right? Hence, I think that's very likely (but not necessarily) Right to Dream. Getting the universe right is our priority.\n<blockquote>A better phrase-fit for Simulationism would be "What would it be like", which I've often shortened to "What if" as in "What would it be like to play an exhiled Elf Lord in Tolkien's Middle Earth" and "What if this Elf knew a secret that would greatly aid the Fellowship but no one would trust him due his past". I've likened Simulationism to a wind up toy. Getting the set up just right is essential (like setting up a chemistry experiment) but then you have to let play run its course as it happens (again much like a chemistry experiment).</blockquote>\nBut:<br/>1. Creative Agenda is something that only happens in concrete instances of play, over time. Deciding on a setup or setting or situation doesn't make it an agenda. I could just as easily play Story Now in the "what ifs" you describe.<br/>2. Since CA requires a prolonged, active investment on part of the players during the game, "What would it be like to play an Elf in Middle Earth" becomes the agenda. We keep the facts that this is <i>an elf in middle earth</i> sacrosanct. What do Middle Earth elves do? That's what he does. What does it mean for a Middle Earth elf to be exiled? That's what happens to him. If you leave those parameters, you break from the agenda (if there was one in the first place).\n<blockquote>The reason I find this sort of play largely incompatable with the Right to Dream, is because the Dream in such play is not what's sacrosanct. In true Simulationist Star Wars play it would be completely acceptable for Luke Skywalker to die while failing to blow up the Death Star...thereby completely altering the "Dream" of what play in that Universe will look like from that point forward.</blockquote>\nWhat's the "What if" here? Like, if this was an actual game, what would be the "What if?" drive with which we entered play?<br/><br/>I think this is the crucial question, so even if you skip the rest, please answer this.\n<blockquote>Interestingly, for my own formulation of this portion of the Big Model, I put what you've described as the Right to Dream at the Exploration level and defined it as pure explanation without any further Creative Agenda. I.e. Exploration sans any trace of Story Now, Step on Up, or What If. So in away...it does become "Exploration Squared". i.e. Exploration with a Creative Agenda of more Exploration. Which is consistant with how the Right to Dream is described in the Big Model, but not compatable with what I believe the actual Simulationist agenda really should be.<br/><br/>Gregor, I'd love to hear more about the perceived inadequacy of Right to Dream as Exploration Squared, as that's where my formulation puts it.</blockquote>\nOk, sure. Two analogies I like: jamming with a band and hiking.<br/><br/>Jamming: "All gaming is exploration" is almost like saying "All music is making sounds". Exploration Squared would be "let's make double the sounds!" or (less snark-ily) "let's make sounds for their own sake". Then I start breaking a beat, you start playing classical violin and someone else plays the honkey tonk. And we look at each other like "what the hell?". "Let's explore" is not enough to constitute a creative agenda, we got to get a groove together. There's something missing.<br/><br/>Hiking: So let's go hiking in the open country. We've never been here, we're exploring. Each step we take reveals a new patch of land, we're going into the unknown. So what's exploration for exploration's sake here? Just running around, each in his own direction, to see if we fall into any holes? Mapping the territory inch by inch, drawing intricate maps? You need to explore <i>something</i>, right? If we're doing "double exploration" we still need an object of our exploration. That's why exploration in itself cannot constitute an agenda, in my eyes. "Exploration Squared" is not an agenda.<br/><br/>So what are we exploring? Our own hiking skills, seeing how far we can go or if we can climb that mountain, testing limits, figuring out which shoes work best for what occasions? Step on Up.<br/>Are we exploring what happens to people like us, stuck together out here? Where will our passions drive us, and how will we act in untenable situations? Story Now.<br/>Are we exploring the world, seeing how it works? Or our role as hikers? Or hiking to affirm our friendship? Right to Dream.<br/><br/>Now, watch it, the world doesn't exist. We need to maintain it and preserve it. The object of our exploration is the world, then the world is the dream, we must keep it real. Our role as hikers? What do hikers do? That's what we'll do. We won't throw trash on the ground or pick wild flowers. There are conventions and rules about what's appropriate. Affirming our friendship - we're friends on a journey, that's what we're doing. I won't stab you because you took my chocolate beans. I won't push you down when we try to climb that hill and I won't try to be first in line to fight the bear when he comes to eat our lunch.<br/><br/>So, exploration, yes, but there's always exploration. For Right to Dream exploration the agenda is not "exploration" but rather keeping certain elements in check, censoring what we don't like or is intruding in whatever our dream is and supporting what we find to be right for the dream. <i>That's</i> the agenda. That's what we do at the table, collectively, over a period of time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ok, now to read the rest of the posts...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299939/#Comment_299939" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T00:46:38+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 12:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 12:52AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, let me see if I'm reading you right:<br/><br/>Exploration is a Toy.<br/><br/>When you add a goal of victory, the Toy becomes a Game, while retaining some Toy-like features.<br/><br/>When you add a goal of addressing premise, likewise.<br/><br/>When you add a goal of simulation, or celebrating an aesthetic, or virtual experience, the Toy is still a Toy.<br/><br/>Is that correct?

That makes them less like toys and more apt to deal with certain agendas.<br/>"The toy is still a toy" might apply to RtD games, but we still play a game with it. Like, think of children playing in the yard. Someone on here once talked about how he watched children play with a hose in the summer. At one point, someone said "You can't go behind the tree!" <br/><br/>Sure, the hose was a toy, the whole yard was a toy, but it was a game. "You can't go behind the tree!" is us playing a game with the toys. "Tolkien Elves don't shoot magic fire out of their hands!"<br/>Luke Skywalker might die, if that's what we agreed on to play, but it was because "The santhulorian fusion-engine shields always explode when hit with a lightsaber!"<br/><br/>A text that supported a particular Dream would have stuff like "Vampires need to drink blood once per fortnight." or whatever. Does it make less of a toy? Probably maybe. HWCTLH is a great example of the game providing structure to "getting it right".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299943/#Comment_299943" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T01:05:07+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  1:05AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 1:22AM by David_Berg.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor, I think we can agree on how RTD's been defined (below), but I think it's really hard to say whether that's one CA type, or several, or whether it's on the same "level" as Gamism or Narrativism.

I'm not going to argue if someone comes up with a convincing argument for splitting it into several, but I haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>I <b>do</b> think it is on the same level as the other two agendas, because (if functional) it requires consistent player investment (through affirmation and constructive denial) over a period of play.<br/><br/>For "what if" games, I think it's very important to ask what the specific "what if" question for each game is. "What if" can be just a setting or situation or colour pitch. <br/><br/>"What if Cthulhu actually woke and ravaged the earth?" is a way to determine setting/colour and does NOT constitute any specific agenda.

From what I can tell, Universalis is actually a toy. It has mechanics that you can fiddle with to introduce facts into a world, add new rules into the "game", and resolve conflicts, but the game (or toy) itself does not impose a goal on the players. (I can't find my copy atm, but that's my recollection.) Of course, the players can introduce their own goals, and thereby make their own play into a game. As I remember, when my friends and I played several years ago, I was absolutely amazed at the richness and depth of the world we created together with it. We started out knowing that our goal was to create a world, and, by golly, the system did an awesome job at helping us do that. And then, once we got to the point of having the characters actually do something, the play suddenly fell flat. We didn't know what to do. I suppose we had the abstract goal of creating a good story, but we were very new to story games at the time and just didn't have a clue about how to go about it. So, we didn't know we should create a premise and then have each of the scenes address that premise in some way. I'm sure if we had known that, then play would have been a lot smoother. As it was, we just sort of fumbled around with the toy for a while (in essence kicking the ball back and forth between each other with no real purpose) and then just stopped playing it after a while when we got bored</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly why I say Universalis is just an exploration toolbox.  It gives you the tools to create a great basis for Exploration but it gave you no goal or agenda that moved play forward.  It relied on you to bring that agenda to the elements of exploration you created.

So the rules should be simple and fast to use/resolve.<br/><br/><b>The System Gives Results That Support the Dream</b> RtD players and GMs have a reputation for fudging results, which is probably well deserved. If it doesn't fit our conception of Batman to have him slip on a puddle and knock himself out, we'll ignore the dice if they say that happens. So a text can support RtD by not throwing that result up in the first place. There's several different paths you can take to get to this - one is diceless gaming, as mentioned by Lorraine above. A second path is to make fudging part of the game by giving both players and GMs a limited pool of reroll tokens (Savage Worlds does this, as does 7th Sea). A third path would be to have a resolution system which gives predictable results, where people generally perform at their expected skill levels (e.g. Fudge). A fourth option is to use resolution systems which give more than a binary yes/no result (so using "yes, but" and "no, but" options).<br/><br/><b>Comprehensive Simulation of the World</b> In RtD play, it can often be important to know not only whether you can fight orcs or defend your passions, but whether Spider-Man can pick up a bus. To be more specific - the RtD player will want to know not whether it's appropriate for Spider-Man to do this to further the story, or whether he can do it for combat advantage, but simply whether Spider-Man could "actually" pick up that specific bus. So it can help to have a system which is easily relatable to arbitrary real-world concerns. This seems to inevitably mean tables of one sort or another. Personally I think the most elegant solution is the one seen in Greg Gorden's designs for Mayfair and others in the 90s (DC Heroes, TORG, Underground), where everything is represented in game units. So a bus might have a weight of 8 game units, which means that if Spider-Man's strength is 8 or more, then yes, he can lift it. But most people seem to just prefer to have a table which tells you how much Spider-Man can lift, and start from there.<br/><br/><b>System Tied to Setting/Genre/Style</b> What I mean by this one is that, given System Matters, it makes sense to use a set of rules which have been designed to support the specific Dream you want to have. So much as a Story Now game will focus on a specific premise/story, a Right to Dream game should focus on a specific setting, style and/or genre. There's a bit of looseness here though, given overlapping expectations across styles and genres. There's a few systems out there for example which model "cinematic action", which can be used successfully with a range of genre tropes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300229/#Comment_300229" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T07:27:36+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  7:27AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To give an example of this last one, someone observed once that as in the books James Bond sticks with his Walther PPK in spite of its inconvenient habit of jamming, a James Bond RPG in which all handguns are equivalent and never jam would not be satisfactory.

What I'm saying basically is that as a Right to Dream focused player, you want to say "I throw my batarang at the Joker" based on the fact that that's what Batman would do, rather than flipping through the rulebook to find the optimum tactic at that moment. So (arguably) a game with a lot of tactical complexity is bad for this agenda, because the complexity invites you to engage with it, when the player would prefer to pick an action which "feels" right.<br/><br/>The other side of this is sheer speed of resolution. The "value" of a given scene to the narrative may not be very high, and so it shouldn't take too long to resolve. It may well be "right" for the genres/tropes in use for the current dream to have a scene where Batman has to fight an army of thugs, but this is in no way an important scene. If it takes three hours to resolve at the table, the players will start to forget what the point of the scene was in the first place...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300251/#Comment_300251" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-10T09:46:58+00:00" title="November 10, 2010  9:46AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, I dig <i>The System Gives Results That Support the Dream</i>.

One is genre/setting/what if-based play where people want to explore the setting further (like a version of Star Wars where it's OK if the story turns out totally different, so long as certain things are retained). The other is based on wanting to experience a world in its own right - Tekumel and Jorune are the two obvious examples here - just for the fun of being there. With those two games, there's very little in the way of canon to experiment with (none at all, for Jorune).<br/><br/>Obviously the two agendas are compatible enough to cause no big problem at the table most of the time.

That has two dimensions - the physical environment that you're dreaming (the "there"), and also the understanding of how things such as physics work in this place (I'm tempted to call this the "being" by I may be guilty of trying to over-stretch definitions to do this).<br/><br/>Both of these are important, and both need to be commonly understood and agreed by everyone in the group for sustainable RtD play.<br/><br/>(sprinkle "I believe" as needed through this post, I'm saying how I see things, not writing a manifesto or anything).<br/><br/>So, to return to your examples, in a Bond game there's a big slice of physics/reality to be agreed on, and a smaller slice of location (as Bond is a "real world plus" setting). To run a sustainable game in something like Tekumel or Jorune, you need to have shared understanding of what those worlds are - both in terms of their geography and social reality, but also the physical reality, as modelled by the game engine. <br/><br/>I <i>could</i> ignore the Jorune rules and use a pulp game engine to run it as a free-wheeling planetary romance, and if my group were all on board for that, it might be a successful game. But if I invited someone else to the game who only knew Jorune via the published materials, it wouldn't be satisfactory to them.<br/><br/>Does that make it clearer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300568/#Comment_300568" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T11:30:10+00:00" title="November 12, 2010 11:30AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to hold to the "being there" idea for RtD play but I think that's a bit off and you can get that feel in any of the CA, Apocalypse World seems to aim for it in a game aimed at Story Now play.  What RtD requires is a bit more complex and I tried to point it out above but the Jorune talk gives me an example from my own play experience that might help to illustrate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran a Jorune campaign in the early to mid 90's.  It started with the Tauther quest (a quest to become Citizens of society by performing actions on the behalf of those who are already citizens) and lead to a quest involving Shanthas and secret crystal cities.  Two of the three characters were fairly easy to integrate into the campaign, a Bronth and a Human, but the third was much trickier.  The player created a Crugar thief which was a fully valid character in the system but it caused some problems.  Due to the history of the world of Jorune Crugar (a race of catmen) were not all that welcome in the Human lands that had the quest, on top of that a thief is not the profession of someone you expect to be looking to become an upstanding citizen.   We ended up having the Crugar arrested and forced along on the quest (with the aid of a kind of restraining collar).   He was able to act mean and vicious but still go along on the quest and help defend villages from Ramian pirates, go on a hunt for a Corondon, stop a swarm of giggits ravaging out of the jungle, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasnt just about getting Jorune right it was about using Jorune to give us exciting material for the questing experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300575/#Comment_300575" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T11:47:25+00:00" title="November 12, 2010 11:47AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>Let me go back to my own personal definition of RtD as being all about the creation of the feeling of "being there".

If your game is pretty dissatisfying, it's possible that creative agenda analysis can help you figure out what's wrong. Creative agenda as a concept only says, "If y'all reinforce the same things about what makes the campaign good, your game will be better." It's not magic. <br/><br/>Except it's a little more focused than that, on the creative aesthetic and not the technical choices, and that's that. <br/><br/>You really haven't described any of your play at all, except for this brief snippet:\n<blockquote>As a Sim-style player (or at least someone who is not Gam or Nar and so Sim by default) I'd agree with this. To me (as a player) the point of RPGing is "Being an Elf". I consider a good session to be one where I really had the feeling of "being there", and a memorable session is one where my Elf did something particularly memorable (so Story After, in exactly the same way it happens in real life, with the caveat that the average RPG character's life involves a lot more conflict than mine).</blockquote>\nYou're talking about what made you happy without mentioning any other players. There's no way from what you've described to make any reasonable predictions about your group's creative agenda or lack thereof. Really, every gamer thinks that a memorable session is one where her character did something memorable, since characters are the agents of play in just about every RPG. It kinda begs the question. Really, we should be asking <i>why</i> whatever happened was memorable. <br/><br/>* Was it because the choices you made for your Elf overcame great challenges in the face of adversity? <br/>* Was it because the choices you made for your Elf resonated with you and the rest of the group? <br/>* Was it because the choices you made for your Elf reinforced a group-shared sense of setting, character, situation, or even system?<br/><br/>If everyone in your group is nodding at one of those, you have a coherent creative agenda. Coherent in the sense that everyone is pushing in the same direction, so your game goes further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok" title="Grymbok"><img alt="Grymbok" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grymbok">Grymbok</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300594/#Comment_300594" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T12:38:52+00:00" title="November 12, 2010 12:38PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>So when you say "I'm an agenda free player", do you mean that (a) you aren't meshing with groups, (b) you're meshing with groups because of direct social stuff and not because of game play itself, or (c) you're meshing with groups over random momentary acts that aren't part of a larger set of standards and priorities?</blockquote>\nWell, that was a bit of an over-statement, which was why I went back and edited the point about it not being important to me. When I stand back and look at it I can see that ultimately my group <i>is</i> focused on Right to Dream, in the sense that we don't generally follow the other agendas, and that we would do different things if we were. But, going back to the definitions Adam gave - <i> a group's shared commitment to elements of the fiction that have been established before play, and getting them "right."</i> - it just doesn't feel like an important part of what we do.<br/><br/>Where I'm coming from is this. Story Now was defined as an agenda, and games were made to focus on it, and people who liked Story Now liked them. Same for Step On Up. But a game that focused specifically on genre/fiction fidelity sounds utterly uninteresting to me, and, I believe, also to the people I game with.

That's what I call "getting it Right," and that's a hallmark of Right to Dream. The positive reinforcement is important, but the negative reinforcement (what we theory wankers call "constructive denial") is just as important. It's your Right to say, "No, that isn't what I mean.

My experience of running BRP CoC was that the less of BRP you use, the better it works. Probably for the same reason - I didn't want BRP to simulate anything much in the CoC universe, except maybe SAN loss. Mainly I wanted it to get the hell out of the way of the atmosphere.

I'll try to explain better.<br/><br/>My understanding about the CAs, based on these discussions and elsewhere, is that the important thing about them is that they're <i>exclusive</i>. If, at a given moment in play, you're prioritising Right to Dream as a player, then you're inherently <i>not</i> also thinking about Step On Up or Story Now. However, there's a million other things you <i>may</i> be doing, which exist at different levels of the Big Model, or potentially even in unmapped zones of theory but still related to engagement with the game and/or the Shared Imagined Space.<br/><br/>With me so far? If I'm wrong up to here already please point it out!<br/><br/>So. What I'm saying is that, in my group, I can absolutely see these agendas present in our play. We have a mix of Step On Up and Right to Dream predominantly, with Right to Dream existing as our "trump" agenda, in that any challenge arising via Step On Up still needs to feel right within the fiction. But - and this is the key point - neither of these are that important at the table. Let me go back to something Adam said to me upthread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>we should be asking<i>why</i>whatever happened was memorable.<br/><br/>* Was it because the choices you made for your Elf overcame great challenges in the face of adversity?<br/>* Was it because the choices you made for your Elf resonated with you and the rest of the group?<br/>* Was it because the choices you made for your Elf reinforced a group-shared sense of setting, character, situation, or even system?<br/><br/>If everyone in your group is nodding at one of those, you have a coherent creative agenda. Coherent in the sense that everyone is pushing in the same direction, so your game goes further.</blockquote>\nNow - I will note in passing that I think that what's enjoyable in play and memorable after play is often different, but let's leave that aside for now.<br/><br/>So what's memorable to our group? What are the "war stories" we tell each other again and again? Well, in general, it's the stuff that was memorable because it was just inherently exciting or funny. Just like the stories people tell about real life. We talk about the epic battle with the unkillable man (which was engaging just because of the disruptive terror of not being able to kill something in AD&amp;D, and our worries that he'd kill us all in our sleep), we talk about the silly little character moments, like the uptight PC who wouldn't go in the sewers without being carried, and we joke about GM descriptions gone wrong (antechamber/anti-chamber, and the time when I described a mix of whistling wind and unearthly screaming and the players decided it was a large monster on a squeaking trolley.<br/><br/>Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that, in my experience, with my group it's memorable if we have an encounter where James Bond is fighting some guys while dangling on a cargo net at the back of a plane in flight - not because of the Creative Agendas that may or may not be in play at that moment, but purely because it's a fight on the outside of a flying plane.<br/><br/>My read of that is that CA isn't a big thing to us. Others may read it that we have a "stealth" RtD agenda where we're playing to an assumed set of background tropes and that it's getting those right rather than the What Would Batman Do agenda that we usually associate with RtD that rings our bells.<br/><br/>My point though is that - with the group I play with - it doesn't seem to me that a better understanding of CAs will help me run better games, so I'm not too worried about having them further diagnosed in my play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300845/#Comment_300845" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T08:18:14+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  8:18AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for playing along this long, Steve. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> <br/><br/>Where Forge theory really gets interesting is when you get down to specific techniques (like "IIEE" -- Intent, Initiation, Execution, Effect: the order in which stuff is established in the fiction).

In a DitV game, it's the time from character generation (included) to the end of the final city.<br/><br/>If GDS talks about one person buying a train ticket, and considering the single decision, of course in a year everybody buy different tickets, GNS considers the entire train traffic of the united states in a very long time period. From that, deduces the population movement in the entire country (aka "the gaming group"), to see if there is a general tendency to go from east to west, or to west to east.<br/><br/>And, if the total train traffic shows that more people travel east to west, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's not possible</span> that in the same time period (in the same game) shows that more people travel west to east.<br/><br/>(the example is very imperfect, don't take it as saying that GNS counts the choices of the players, it's only to show you the different scales at which these theories works)<br/><br/>This is the reason why most people, when they "get" GNS, exclaim "but it was obvious! I thought that it was something much more complex", and most people who already got GNS are really fed up with the amount of traffic generated by this really obvious part of a much bigger theory...<br/><br/>So, no, if you have "moments of step on up" in a game where you address premise, it's perfectly normal. Happen to everyone in every game. it's not a proof that you play in two different creative agenda at the same time (seeing as CA is defined, it would be even logically impossible:"in my game overall we preferred step on up over right to dream. But at the same time, we overall preferred right to dream over step on up")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300864/#Comment_300864" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T10:24:40+00:00" title="November 15, 2010 10:24AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, let's lay off Steve.

I'm interested in taking my gaming "from good to great", and I think we're all agreed that CAs aren't a tool that will help me on that journey.<br/><br/>There's a side issue of course of whether or not I'm qualified to advocate for Right to Dream by being someone who regular participates in instances of play which prioritise this agenda. My view is that what I wrote above (and quote below) is still true at the larger "instance of play" level than on the moment of play level I made the anecdote at. Which is to say - no, I don't think I am someone who can speak authoritatively about RtD play, and therefore we're all cluttering up Gregor's thread a bit <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that, in my experience, with my group it's memorable if we have an encounter where James Bond is fighting some guys while dangling on a cargo net at the back of a plane in flight - not because of the Creative Agendas that may or may not be in play at that moment, but purely because it's a fight on the outside of a flying plane.<br/><br/>My read of that is that CA isn't a big thing to us. Others may read it that we have a "stealth" RtD agenda where we're playing to an assumed set of background tropes and that it's getting those right rather than the What Would Batman Do agenda that we usually associate with RtD that rings our bells.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300901/#Comment_300901" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T14:15:25+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  2:15PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>That's not what I'm saying. I'll try to explain better.<br/><br/>My understanding about the CAs, based on these discussions and elsewhere, is that the important thing about them is that they're<i>exclusive</i>.</blockquote>\nThat's the thing: they aren't. Or rather, they only are when you look at that much longer, bigger cycle of play between moments of real satisfaction, <i>and</i> when they conflict.<br/><br/>It's important to remember that CA and GNS were both derived specifically from looking for kinds of play that conflict at the same table. So IMO a kind of "hard cases make bad law" effect kicked in, and this foundational thing called CA ended up being derived from social conflicts. Which, as it turns out, are actually pretty darned complicated. So sometimes CA is "conception of play," sometimes it's "long-term reward of play," and more often it's this weird amalgam of the two... which is not to say that we don't sit down to do this due to a weird amalgam of stuff in our heads. 'Cause I think we do. But it'll take knowing a whole lot more than we do about status, games and stories to sort that out; it doesn't need a place in the Forge model in the meantime. I'm in favor of keeping it simple.<br/><br/>Note that all this is opinion and blowhardiness, which is how theory is done. (THIS IS JOKE. IS JOKE TIME.) Also note that IMO there are substantial nuggets of theory goodness within each of the "CA families" and we shouldn't throw the babies out with the bathwater.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300903/#Comment_300903" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-15T14:20:50+00:00" title="November 15, 2010  2:20PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grymbok</cite>I'm interested in taking my gaming "from good to great", and I think we're all agreed that CAs aren't a tool that will help me on that journey.</blockquote>Most likely; but it kinda depends on what's holding you back from greatness.  <br/><br/>The idea that you're all sharing certain creative goals might come in handy.  And who knows, some of the RTD topics like aesthetic standards, agreement on input material, constructive denial of how y'all create the fictional world, etc., might give you inspiration for new ways of doing things.<br/><br/>But yeah, your odds may be better just focusing on practical specifics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13312/game-texts-that-support-right-to-dream" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13312/game-texts-that-support-right-to-dream" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13312/game-texts-that-support-right-to-dream/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13312%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13312%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
