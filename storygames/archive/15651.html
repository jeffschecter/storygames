For reasons.<br/><br/>Here's some examples, from what I know and have played.<br/><br/>1. Spirit of the Century - has a really neat way of tying PCs together at character creation by doing a round robin history writing. PC interactions often come into the focus in this game!<br/>2. Ganakagok - the relationship map, order of play, and relationship building with other characters is really important in this game<br/>3. Burning Wheel - Circles tests are a unique mechanic that tell you what NPCs you might know<br/>4. All of Emily Care Boss's games, which I have yet to play, seem to focus on this exclusively, in magical ways I have yet to understand<br/>5. Fiasco - forces players sitting next to each other to create PCs that have a relationship with each other<br/>6. Apocalypse World - creates instant history between PCs in character creation, and evolves throughout play. and sex moves. of course.<br/><br/>So, I'm looking for PC + PC relationships, PC + NPC relationships. Games that focus on these exclusively or primarily, or examples of a specific mechanic in a game which does this really well.

Let me think of some ways they're addressed in various J-RPGs, I might be able to think of a few.<br/>Outside of that fringe element, though:<br/><br/><b>DREAD </b>(horror action RPG): You have a list of (up to two) contacts, which are your character's "NPC friends/mentors/etc". You know up to two. As soon as you gain a third, one of the other two DIES, usually HORRIBLY. It's in the rules.<br/><br/>Hmmm. Y'know, I'm trying to visualize my game library in my head to think of more (I'm at the library), but I'm kinda drawing a blank on interesting, cool PC or NPC relationship mechanics aside from all the games listed above.<br/><br/>If I squinted my eyes, I might say "<b>shock: social science fiction</b>", where your relationship between your character and that character's antagonist is THE SINGLE RELATIONSHIP THAT MATTERS in the game, rulewise. It drives everything.<br/><br/>I'm trying to put Polaris on this list, too (in the way that the other NPC characters that appear in the game are categorized into 3 classifications, etc?) but it's been long and I'm a little rusty.<br/><br/>The current/unfinished version of <b>Bliss Stage</b> has you name all of the other NPCs your character encounters as girls/guys You Liked In High School, which really tripped me out in a bad (read "good/sensate way") way.<br/><br/><b>With Great Power</b>, relationships are just like any other power, ability, or aspect of your character. You can punch the bad guy with your Love of your Girlfriend. And like any other skill or power, relationships can be lost or changed in the same way.<br/><br/>I have not finished my read-through of <b>Amaranthine</b> yet, but your relationships are the central part of the game, and there's a weird circular grid thing to track the stage, status, health and direction of those relationships. <br/>(PDF of sheet is here: <a href="http://machineageproductions.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Amaranthine-Sheet-2-Page-8-30-20111.pdf" rel="nofollow">Amaranthine RPG Char Sheet</a> )<br/><br/><b>Weapons of the Gods/Wulin</b> had two interesting things:<br/>* You actually created an honest-to-god character relationship map, and got bonuses or drawbacks to some rolls depending on those relationships<br/>* For most background NPCs, you have to buy relationships with character creation points (Lore Sheets). Having a gay lover might cost 15 points, being a friend of the empress might be 50 points (for some examples). Not all these grant mechanical bonuses, just story points and elements to use in-story.<br/><br/>If I think of more, I'll re-edit this post.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354905/#Comment_354905" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T17:10:37+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  5:10PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm surprised no one's mentioned <b>Hero's Banner</b>.

It's a double-edged sword however: trusting someone a lot is great when they're helping you, but they can also use that trust to stab you in the back more effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn <b>Hot War</b>, this gets altered to a relationship mechanic: you can have a relationship to any PC or NPC which is positive or negative. You get first choice on using +ve relationships but the target gets first choice to use your -ve relationship with them, adding to the dice pool rolled by that side in both cases. Also, relationships can only be changed by spending the consequences of a succesful roll, so you can give other characters increasingly -ve relationships with you: you make a lot of enemies, but you're very powerful against them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354946/#Comment_354946" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T08:24:20+00:00" title="January 19, 2012  8:24AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.
