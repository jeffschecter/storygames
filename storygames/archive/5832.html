The setting chapters were full of timelines, locations, occupations and theories about the horrible state of the world, humanity desperately clinging to survival with one hand, clutching a mechanical spike launching parasol in the other. But the start of the character creation chapter threw me such a turn, I haven't been able to pick the book back up.<br/><br/>Y'see, after the character attributes are explained, we move on to the corruption ratings. In addition to the traditional bullets and claws, a fine Neo-Victorian citizen can be laid low by encroaching zombie disease, good ol' madness or other supernatural invasion, for examples. But what got me was the line saying that one day your character WILL succumb to one of these means of decay and it will then be time to make up a new character. <br/><br/>Yeah, I know it doesn't sound like much, but after the 100 or so pages of set up, I had to step back and ask "Why isn't this on the first page?" This changes the entire tenor of the book, as I had been reading it, up to that point. It is actually not a game about steampunk adventure in a world of horrors, it is a game of personal horror and the downward spiral, like Vampire was supposed to be. Or is it? Do the designers expect that people will chuckle about that line and move on? Maybe there's a retraction of that statement another 5 pages in?<br/><br/>What matters is that it really got me thinking. How just one casual phrase in the rules, an offhand description of how they will affect your character, bowled me over. Made me feel I had MISUNDERSTOOD all the writing up to that point. Yep. I felt dumb. I mentioned it to Jenn and she asked me "What did you expect?" I don't know. I wasn't expecting that!<br/><br/>Is there a lesson here? Sure. Transparency of intent I suppose. Maybe something about editing. But most importantly, I stopped reading when I felt I had been mislead. I'll come back eventually, but my fervor has been diminished.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130503/#Comment_130503" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T08:57:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  8:57AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything strikes people in different ways.
