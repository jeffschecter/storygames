He has asked me to take over and will work with me but he has to leave a month or so before the con starts so he can help me for a bit. The reason he picked me is I run the most gaming events at the con so my names comes up. At least I can't see any other reason.<br/><br/>It is mainly a sci-fi convention that has a smallish gaming (RPGs, CCGs, and board games) areas. So mostly i do timetable organization for a small section of the convention. The general go of gaming has been people hold games, the con head for gaming occasionally shows up and hands out tickets for a draw. So not much.<br/><br/>Anyone have a suggested event that could be run there? Or something to do aside from providing table space?<br/>Or advice for someone that has never tried to do anything like this before?<br/>I'm coming into it with next to zero XP on the con side of things, just running several games over the last few years of the con.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121635/#Comment_121635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T00:33:56+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 12:33AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            He left and threw you the 25th anniversary of the con?

In general most cons have the following income sources to pull from\n<ol>\n<li>Previous income. If your con or group has a bank account with money then there may be some left over from previous years, this will be pretty much the only source for any outlays</li>\n<li>Door tickets. Find out how many people normally come and then assume you can get full price entry for about 80% of them (the rest will be guests, staff, traders, people with discounts and the like in an average con, plus a bit more to allow for a bad year)</li>\n<li>Traders. If you have a trade hall or area then you will normally be charging traders money, but this is hard to bank on. Just a little market downturn, or bad scheduling, can rob you of half the stalls that were coming, and a small con usually has to give space away for free in circumstances like that, since it can't afford to have empty stalls. Maybe assume you can get 75% of the traders that came last time without extra effort.</li>\n<li>Advertising and Sponsorship. You can make some money if you have a program to sell advertising space in, but it usually only covers the printing costs unless you are big. Sponsorship is a similarly uncertain form of revenue. Some games companies coming as guests may contribute, but it is more likely to be in terms ot products and demos than actual money unless you are very lucky</li>\n<li>Merchandise. It's possible to make a profit on merchandise, most commonly t-shirts, but not a lot. Some cons will have a stock of old t-shirts and the like to sell, which will bring in a small bit of money on the day, but its nothing to bank on.</li>\n</ol>\nOnce you know where the money is coming from have a look at the outlays and see what you can pay for. The most important is the Venue, which is likely to eat most of your up front money, unless you are lucky to have a free venue (as student societies sometimes do) or lots of money. Most Venues need to be booked well in advance, and you need dates and a location to be fixed before you can get traders or advertise. So step 1 is always secure your venue. If you want the same format as last year then the same venue is a good bet (unless it had annoying problems), but it can be worth shopping around, and you will certainly need to do so if you plan to expand greatly.<br/><br/>Once you have a venue and a date look at the remaining money. If you still have a fair amount you can consider flying in guests from somewhere, which is especially good if you want to expand or like in this case when it is a big anniversary. If you don't then find some local guests instead, or friends or friends who will come for cheap. Guests are a big draw for most cons, so I would think about them even if your con has not had them in the past.<br/><br/>The other immediate thing is advertising. My mantra was always advertise early, often, and everywhere. You can certainly advertise well before you have guests, games, or traders. Get a website up, or make sure an existing one is updated. Get the word out on online lists of cons, and mention it on forums as soon as you have a fixed date. As the date approaches consider if you need paper advertising. Some cons will need flyers at other local events, posters at gaming stores and clubs and the like, some will get away mostly with online adverts. Personally I'd always advise posters in the local area regardless of the online response, but I might be a fuddy-duddy there <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>After you have a date, and adverts, and are negotiating for guests, start looking for traders if you are having them. Many stores will travel a long way to come to a con, but they need plenty of advance warning, much more than games companies, demo teams, GMs and the like. If you can get advance payments (which are plausible for established cons with good turnouts) then this can be a real boon, giving you money 3 or 4 months in advance, but many traders will want to pay on the day out of their takings if they don't know you or the con is new.<br/><br/>Then, finally, when all that stuff is out of the way, you can start thinking about calling for GMs, organising events, scheduling slots, working out your signup and advance booking (if any) systems and the like. In my experience wargames and CCG tournaments require a lot more advance warning than tabletop games, with LARP events inbetween<br/><br/>And my final, key, advice ... get other people to help you, and get them soon <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122026/#Comment_122026" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T09:24:28+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  9:24AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have attended the con 3 times before.

It is also primarily a literary sci-fi convention, but there are always gamers.  <br/><br/>I tried some new things to get new folk into the game room this year.  <br/><br/>First was my cross-pollination plan.  I had games run that related in some way to the convention's special guests.  We had Eric Flint and author guest of honor, Sue Dawe as artist guest of honor, and Voltaire was the musical guest.  Luckily, there is RPG set in one of Eric Flint's fictional worlds and an RPG based on Voltaire's cartoon Chi Chian.  Sue Dawe had done some illustrations for some card games, but they are out of print - so that was a little stretch.  Fortunately Kat Miller is working on a story game that uses art as character and story inspirations.  I was able to get permission from Sue Dawe to use her art in a demo of the game.<br/><br/>I also had a friend run an introduction to improvisation workshop.  That was pretty awesome.  <br/><br/>"Paint and Take" miniatures painting workshops are fun.  I didn't have the space to have one this past convention, but I hope to have one in 2008.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122297/#Comment_122297" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T07:28:19+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  7:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're talking about heading the gaming track at the con, right?

Some larger board games can be played at the banquet tables. Check with the current gaming chair to find out what types of games are usually played at the convention. This will give you a good idea about the number of tables needed and the configuration. Get the convention site to put tablecloths on the tables. You won't need drapery on the tables.<br/><br/><b>Gaming HQ</b><br/>At a table by the entrance to the gaming room/area, have one of those classroom seating tables, preferably with drapery on the front to make it visually look like a different table than the regular gaming tables. Your security person should have already checked the badges of anyone coming to the gaming room. If this has access to the public, non-convention areas you'll need room for a security person here. At a larger convention, you will not be security for the gaming room.<br/><br/>At the table you will need a vertical space for GMs to advertise games. Check your convention center contract -- the ones I've seen state that certain things cannot be tacked or taped to the wall. A nice bulletin board to pin up advertising flyers for my game slots is one thing I really like at gaming rooms. <br/><br/>If you have clipboards with signup sheets, keep the entire sheet visible. Don't stack the clipboards. Let people see what's being played. On the signup sheets, include the description of the game. For those of us with crazy indie RPGs that nobody has heard of, this can help to draw new players in. Don't think that your handwriting is legible -- do this up in Illustrator, Word, OpenOffice, or your computer program of choice. (Don't go for wacky fonts either -- you want people walking by the table to be able to read big bold text.)  Keep a few blank sign-up sheets for last minute games.<br/><br/>If you've got games and things that people can check out and play, open-gaming style, if they can, put the boxes/books up on edge, like you'd find in a game store. Big art boxes and fancy cover art is more interesting to passersby than small side panel art and spines of books.<br/><br/><b>Events</b><br/>You don't play CCGs but they're a big draw to the con? Reach out to local card game stores to see if they can run organized tournaments. Give them a few tables and let them run the thing, bringing requests and con support to you. Local stores will probably bring their own prize support.<br/><br/><b>Registration Desk</b><br/>Get the gaming room in the convention guide. Not just a mention of it, but a full article like the anime room is going to get. You don't need a schedule in the guide, just mentions of how AWESOME it is and ('specially it's a sci-fi con) something about how if you've ever wanted to take control of your favorite science fiction show or movie, the gaming room is where it's happening. <br/><br/>The convention guide is being printed up sometime before the convention itself. Gaming events fill up in the week or so before the con. How to get this information in convention goers hands? Get the convention committee to add a gaming supplement to the convention bag. Two or three nights before the convention, layout all the games that are listed as running (even if they are full) and all events that are running (like the CCG tournaments you got the local game shop in town to run). Get this to fit on two sheets of paper, take it to your local copy shop and get them to make X black and white double-sided copies where X is the number of convention guides. (Do a fold to make it the size of the actual convention guide. Also get with your marketing or design guy to make it look like part of the convention guide. Note that you will be spending hours folding these if the convention is pretty large. Cough up the extra cash to the copy center to get them to fold them as they are printed. The expense is worth it.) Take this box of printouts to registration and tell the volunteers to make sure every convention attendee gets a copy of the gaming supplement when they pick up their badges. (Take your receipt to your con's finance guy for reimbursement. Make sure you get this cleared with the finance guy before you do it and get quotes from the copy shops so finance will know about this expense.)<br/><br/><b><i>Before the con</i></b><br/><br/><b>Meet people</b><br/>Get involved with the RPGA in your area. Find out who the Herald-level GMs are. Get them to come and run things.<br/><br/>Go to meetup.com and find out if there are any board game, card game, or RPG meetups in your area. Contact the organizers about the convention. Attend meetups in person.<br/><br/>Check out the livejournal community for your city/area. Post about the convention.<br/><br/>Trawl through yahoo groups, searching for [your city] and "game", "gaming", and "gamers". Spend too much time trying to find local area game mailing lists. <br/><br/>Contact high schools and the local university to find out about gaming clubs. Get the word out that there's a gaming room at the con.<br/><br/><b>Go to stores</b><br/>Drop off flyers at card game stores, board game stores, RPG stores, and comic book stores. Create your own gaming room specific flyers for the convention. Shake hands with the owner/manager/whomever is behind the counter. <br/><br/>For the love of Zod, don't wear a t-shirt with stains on it and ratty-hole jeans. Think business casual: collars on an ironed shirt, jeans or khakis that are in nice condition. Shave or trim that facial hair. You want them to think you know what you're doing not that you're just a kid trying to get people to come to a game day.<br/><br/><b>E-Mail</b><br/>Always give them your contact information: set up a gmail account like [yourname]<a href="/forums/profile/gmail">@gmail</a>.com or get gaming@[convention website].

And those can be a problem to con mangement because they see that as a "sale outside of the dealers room", which they don't want over their heads. Make a policy that the packs can only be charged at retail or lower, and anyone can bring their own unsealed packs (as long as it fits the tournament requirements) to the event.<br/><br/>Demos always were awesome. We got so many people from demo teams come to show off a new game. Usually players got free product of some sort, so it worked out.<br/><br/>Have a loaner library! Get some classic board/card games together and make a sign-out sheet so people can play whatever. Best of all, you can use these games for pick-up tournements. My department was crazy on Munchkin.<br/><br/>Make sure the GMs get comped! This was such a headache for me, considering that the con higher-ups preferred to work a staffer into the ground and some departments took offense to me giving "free badges" to people offering 8-10 hours of entertainment, when they had teams working 20. Stand by your department and your GMs and you'll get a better level of support (and a better room for the guests) than just cowtowing to someone who isn't into the whole "Dee un Dee" thing and aren't really sure about how a gaming dept in a con works. The last guy I had to deal with demanded that the GMs could be given free badges, but only if he ran a panel about the game he was running as well as the game.<br/><br/>Also, we recruited a good deal of our staffers from the people who just frequented the department and weren't creeps. They were practically staff and we encouraged staff to start up and play games (as long as there was one guy watching the door) anyways.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122363/#Comment_122363" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T11:16:06+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 11:16AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 11:20AM by Thomas D.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great thing that Mike just reminded me of -- taking sales from the dealer's room. Or rather, not taking sales from them. You'll want to find out what dealers are coming to the convention and if any are gaming-related. If so, check with them to see if they want to run events. At the events like CCG tourneys, you can direct attendees to these vendor booths for cards and whatnot. Depending on the size of your convention, the booths in the dealers room might not have anything to do with gaming and you don't need to worry about stealing sales from them. But if you can drive sales to the vendors, the vendors love it and the convention as a whole loves it: conventions make money from the dealer's room. If the dealers are happy, they will come back next year and the con makes money. If they're not -- such as thinking the con is taking money from them by selling CCG starters and boosters directly to the players in the gaming room -- they might come back and the con loses that booth revenue.<br/><br/>If you're interested in general convention running or just helping the convention out, after sending people to the dealer's room to buy dice or whatever, drop by those booths near the end of the day and introduce yourself as the gaming chair for the con. While you're small talking, let them know that you've been sending attendees to their booth to buy CCG boosters and dice. They'll like knowing that you're driving business to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122372/#Comment_122372" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T11:30:44+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 11:30AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The wording we gave to the high mucky mucks when it came to Sealed Deck purchases done in the room were "Equipment Fees". <br/>After all, we (or the host of the event) didn't <i>sell</i> the stuff, just something you needed to play in the event. No more no less, since we couldn't count on any one dealer to have available stock on hand or the dealer room to be open then. Hey, if Bill's Game n Anime world wants to stock those cards too, we'll point players in the right direction. <br/><br/>The dealers both in the dealer room and in the general area can be your best friends, especially when you know if a gaming focused dealer is coming and you can give them a list of events so he knows what to stock. Which in turn makes guests happy because they have a chance to buy their own copy of that new game they just played and loved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122638/#Comment_122638" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T06:16:51+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  6:16AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the advice everyone.<br/>Febuary 17 is the next con meeting so I'll let you know how it goes then.<br/><br/>The gaming area I am in covers CCGs, board games, miniature battle games (1-2 demos by Warhammer), and RPGs.<br/>Gaming advertisement postersis a great idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
