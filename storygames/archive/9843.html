I was running AM using 5th ed. rules for my group about a year ago.  We'd been going for months, and it became very clear that the rules were simply too dense and grognardy for this group.  For me too, actually, since my tastes had drifted since first playing Ars in the early 90's.  We had great characters, but the time scale management and difficulty of magi doing anything without letting years slip by made the players feel boxed in.  For example, we had a Verditius who simply wanted to make lots of cool animated stuff, little clockwork critters.  Under the existing rules, it would have taken years of in-game time.<br/><br/>When I implemented the rules, we ran one session, which turned out to be a major conflict among the magi and their grogs v. a company of Byzantine cataphractoi that went down in the local village.  It ran like a dream.  We didn't get a chance to play with relationships, but the combat and action sequences merged seamlessly with the magic.  The bits that stood out were the Bjornaer in huge wolf form pulling a leaping stunt to bowl over a horse and rider, and the Merinita using a rusting spell to destroy the armor, weapons, and saddle fittings of a half-dozen cataphractoi charging down the road (range for the spell was "road").  In that one session, all the rules headaches and difficulties simply vanished.  Everyone felt empowered, the rules weren't at all intrusive, and the super cool magical flavor was kept in full force.<br/><br/>The aforementioned Verditius was able to have a bunch of small animated clockwork and willow animal figurines as followers, so he was happy.  The Merinita was able to have the door in her chest and the seven rooks that roosted there in place of her heart as allies, the Bjornaer's Wolf form was potent, and the grogs were as demented and lively as grogs always are in Ars.  I'd call the conversion a smashing success.  Sadly, scheduling and life logistics put the group on hiatus shortly thereafter.  There's been some interest in picking it up again.  I'd probably streamline with keywords, and only break out skills the players wanted to focus on.  I found the sheer number of traits a bit on the heavy side.<br/><br/>I had been jonesing to run HQ, and thought I could do it with Ars.  The main thing people wanted to keep was the magic system, which they found terrifically flavorful.  The challenge was how to port over the spontaneous v. formulaic system and have it (a) not be mechanically burdensome, and (b) still retain enough of the distinct flavor.<br/><br/>In brief, I used three keywords: Vulgar birth (nationality and social class), Follower of House X, and Hermetic Magus.<br/><br/>Here's the rough version of the magic rules I worked out, warts and all.  They are really rough.  A fellow HQ-Ars person on RPG.net was good enough to send his thoughts on spellcasting, which proved valuable with regard to lab work.  We were working out kinks in playtesting, but the notion I started with was to keep the approximate numbers for spellcasting from Ars Technique and Forms, so that the player stats could migrate without too much difference.  In play, the rules set out below seemed to work fine.<br/><br/>Lab work was going to be based on Extended Contests, complete with wagering, pitting player traits on one side and the resistance of the particular project on the other.<br/><br/><b>DETERMINING CASTING TOTAL</b><br/>Add Technique to Form.  This is your base Casting Total, which functions like a Theistic Affinity in HeroQuest.  Add any Augments or applicable Virtues prior to rolling.  Formulaic spells work like Feats--you can raise them independently of Casting Total, though as a bonus called Spell Mastery.  When Casting Total increases, so does Spell Mastery.  Casting Resistance is the Spell Magnitude (Level/5).<br/><br/>Spontaneous magic just gets a -50% improv modifier, whichever is greater.  If a player is willing to take Fatigue Injuries, he or she can reduce this penalty by 10% per Injury taken.  These injuries \u201cheal\u201d at a rate of one hour of rest per level.  All augments and bonuses must be included before the improv modifier.  Casting Resistance is the desired level of effect.<br/><br/><b>SPELLCASTING PROCESS:</b><br/><br/>\t1)\tCASTING ROLL - Casting Total + augments/modifiers v. Spell Magnitude (Level/5)<br/>\t2)\tEFFECT ROLL - Casting Total + augments/modifiers + Casting Victory Bonus v. Target Resistance - Spell Magnitude<br/><br/>CASTING VICTORY BONUS is determined by the CASTING ROLL.<br/><br/>\tMarginal Victory:\t +1<br/>\tMinor Victory: \t\t +3<br/>\tMajor Victory: \t\t +6<br/>\tComplete Victory: \t+10<br/><br/>DETERMINE RESISTANCE:  If the spell succeeds, the target has no native magical resistance unless it has an active avoidance or endurance trait, e.g., a man with a stamina trait may try to soak a Pilum of Fire at a penalty equal to the spell\u2019s magnitude.  This is a simple contest.<br/><br/><i>Does the target have magic resistance?</i><br/><br/>IF YES, then augment the Casting Roll with Penetration.<br/>IF NO, BUT...EVADE.  The target can evade the effect actively.  Augment with Finesse.<br/>IF NO, BUT...SOAK.  the target wishes to soak the effect using a stamina or endurance trait, assess an improvisational modifier before the roll.  <br/><br/>RESOLVE:  If the target has an active ability to resist (e.g., Parma Magica or Magic Resistance), roll as Simple Contest against the Casting Roll augmented by Penetration or Finesse.  The target\u2019s resistance is reduced by the spell magnitude.  If the target cannot actively resist or evade, roll against a target of 1 + any augments.<br/><br/>Magic is DEADLY.<br/><br/><i><b>Example: </b> Catulus casts Pilum of Fire, a Magnitude 5 spell at Alexis, a soldier with scale armor at 1M and Dodge at 17.  Using his Casting Total + Mastery of 17M, Catulus rolls against a target of 5+5 for poor visibility for a total of 10.  He rolls 9, the spell resistance fails outright with a roll of 11, so Catulus succeeds in casting the spell.  Alexis opts to dodge, augmented by his armor at +2 for a total of 19, reduced by the spell\u2019s magnitude of 5 to a final target of 14.  Alexis rolls a 15 and fails.  Catulus bumps his Success to a Critical, and earns a Major Victory.  Catulus rolls again, augmenting with his Finesse of 5M for a +3 bonus.  Catulus gets a Major Victory and spears Alexis with a burst of flame that sends the soldier tumbling to the ground, out of the fight.</i><br/><br/><i><b>Edit:</b></i>  Let me know if this is the kind of information you're looking for.

My brain has turned around Ars Magica in my head for years, knowing I love the fictional elements but needed a new system.  For some reason HQ never occurred to me.<br/><br/>Now, one of the things I like about using HQ in Glorantha during the Hero Wars is that you can hot wire in all the conflicts of religion and family and whatnot directly into attributes.  It allows PCs to directly plug into the setting's starting <i>situation</i>.<br/><br/>I know you haven't really had a chance to play yet, but did you anticipate anything like this?

I keep my notes in Scrivener, and I have character sheets in OmniGraffle (which I think are pretty spiffy).  I'm happy to email them to you or anyone who asks.  I haven't yet bothered to figure out document webhosting, so I don't have it all available for download yet.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I wanted to mention that the Hermetic Magus keyword was meant as the repository for Hermetic Virtues and Flaws as well as common abilities like the Parma Magica.  The House Keyword was for politics and specialties.  If I were to refine, I'd keep Vulgar Birth as a keyword, but not flesh it out unless the player wanted to.  The other keywords might be House, Hermetic Magus, and perhaps Occupation (e.g., Astrologer, Elementalist, etc.).  Not sure if I want Magi to have four keywords, though.  Grogs just had Birth and Occupation.  Companions had Birth, Occupation, and Talents.<br/><br/>What's a pity about our truncated saga post-conversion is that I think HQ's main strength lies in how it handles relationships, and we didn't get a chance to put that bit through its paces.  My second favorite part of Ars after the magic system was always the reputations and personality traits, but these always seemed bolted on mechanically.  I was looking forward to seeing them assume a more center stage role under HQ, especially since the covenant is always a stew of soap opera and interpersonal drama, at least in the games I've participated in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218882/#Comment_218882" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T20:16:58+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  8:16PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Christopher,<br/><br/>I did have the notion of hotwiring conflicts in mind.  We weren't in a starting situation, however, which made the setup more challenging, since HQ pushes things in different ways than the standard Ars system.<br/><br/>One of our magi was an Arab Hermetic from the Levant, the player not wanting to play a white guy.  This character was a Moslem, and we weren't soft-pedaling anything.  As we had a companion who was a pagan priest (setting was 12th century Bulgaria, starting in 1180) and a powerful NPC Flambeau who was very definitely Catholic and grogs who were Greek Orthodox, we had some very interesting conflicts waiting to ignite.  In my mind, however, the central conflict was eventually going to center around the political tension between Venice and Constantinople that eventually culminated in the Fourth Crusade, all spiced with the Bulgar Uprising.  As the saga unfolded, I hoped the players would be drawn into choosing sides or at least feeling conflicted.  HQ would have been ideal for this.  At the same time, we had two players who were deeply into the politics and machinations of the Fae, not something I'd envisioned before character creation.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this part didn't get off the ground, in part because of the saga faltering, and in part because we changed horses mid-stream, so we weren't able to wire in a starting situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218884/#Comment_218884" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T20:48:56+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  8:48PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, the word "relationships" was one I should have mentioned in my post.  The situations don't mean anything without those, and the rules let you plug it all onto the character sheet...<br/><br/>And now that I'm thinking about it more...<br/><br/>What was interesting is that Lion Rampant/White Wolf created a setting that was rich in all this social/political detail -- and then created an environment that allowed the Players to set their characters apart from all of that in a (hermetically) sealed environment.  It would be easy for the Players to simply be above and beyond the entire social/religious/political fabric -- bothered by it on occasion, but never part of it and new conflicted by it.<br/><br/>"I was a Frenchman, but now I live in a covenant."  "I used to be a member of the Church, but now I know magic is real and those guys in the Vatican are stupid."  "I used to have family, but let's face it -- I'm a MAGE now -- I got men and women who work with me and give me all I need."<br/><br/>It's sort of like -- if the group goes down this road -- everyone is the orphaned, independent loner with an eye-patch -- except they all live in a great dorm together.<br/><br/>Which is great.... but kind of blows off what I think works so well (for me at least) when one mixes HQ with Glorantha during the HeroWars.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how I'd actually tackle this yet.  But I'm reading the 4th book in John Crowley's <i>Aegypt</i> series and really loving how in the historical passages about Dr. John Dee and Giordano Bruno and other characters -- even as they deal with magic -- never lose track of their homelands, homesickness, the faith they were brought up in and so on.  Like <i>Pendragon</i>, which deal with the tension between the fantastic and the mundane, I think I'd want to make sure the setting and situations really kept the PCs grounded in the world they grew up in even as they are trying to expand what people could think about the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218892/#Comment_218892" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T23:01:06+00:00" title="July 16, 2009 11:01PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're absolutely right about the relationships.  I'd put those front and center in a reboot of the game.<br/><br/>I think you could make a powerful saga by grounding the characters in their era.  Ars as it stands seems to do this, but I think it actually sets up to accomplish the opposite.  The thing about Ars that works so well for many players is that while set in the medieval era, the magi and covenant have a much more modern mindset.  Egalitarianism, reason-based pseudo-secular pseudo-science, a flattened class structure, isolation from feudal politics for the most part--you could make a good argument that it's a cyst of near-21st century culture dropped in a deeply spiritual medieval environment.  The isolation puts the group outside of history in a way, which probably makes it easier for many players to get into it without having to bone up on medieval history or immerse themselves in the (to us) surprisingly alien side of medieval culture.<br/><br/>Many groups who do the research and dig in can brush against or incorporate the historical aspect, but I'm not sure how many of them let their characters become involved with it.  Further, Ars has a whole other secret history and politics going on with the Order itself, which further adds to the "hermetically sealed" element.  You can have a ton of intrigue going on within the Order without having to step into Mythic Europe at all.<br/><br/>So in a way, I'd say Ars soft-pedals the religious and homeland-based connections deliberately, and makes family connections "vulgar."  The "hermetic" covenant qualifies as an intentional design feature.  Fortunately, I think one could quite easily drift this into conflicts of relationships.  The conflict that jumps out at me first is that of loyalty to the Order v. loyalty to vulgar family.<br/><br/>A lot of Ars dynamics depend on where you set the saga.  If in a remote Welsh valley, you'll probably have a more inward-turning dynamic that will depend on local conflicts, family drama, and maybe a strong fae influence.  Put it, as we did, in Bulgaria on the eve of the Bulgar rebellion against the Byzantine Empire, in the midst of the Constantinople-Venice rivalry, and you have plenty of background upheaval that includes religion, politics, Hermetic meddling, families in jeopardy, divided loyalties, and so on.  Plus we were only a few years from the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which was due to spur all sorts of religious fighting.<br/><br/>Man, talking about this makes me want to pull that group together again and take another run at this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
