Trouble is, I'm not sure where to start. Is there a forum for that, or a set of best practices for finding players and organizing a game?</p>\n<p>I currently run Tunnels &amp; Trolls games for my daughter and nephew, and my wife and brother-in-law join in too. For family play, T&amp;T delivers: It's easy to prepare for, and the Gamist Creative Agenda makes it easy for the players to get into character. It's also very easy to bring in whatever the kids are interested in at the moment, whether it's Moogles, Pokemon, or wizard school.</p>\n<p>But I'm keen to play some Story Now with other players who don't mind the intensity of Sorcerer. Do any of you have experience kicking off an online game? Are there hazards I should know about? Any other wisdom?</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br/>\nJohn</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290996/#Comment_290996" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-01T20:35:56+00:00" title="September  1, 2010  8:35PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Write up your one-sheet and post it online somewhere so you can point people to it.

We have a regular Skype group and we use the dice roller for pretty much every game we played. We've used it to play Fiasco, Dogs in the Vineyard, Grey Ranks, and Hero's Banner so far, and it's worked quite well. Of course, Skype games take about twice as long as a normal game, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>It's not Sorcerer, but I posted some <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12237&amp;page=1#Item_9" rel="nofollow">screens of how we used it to play Fiasco over here.</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291407/#Comment_291407" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T11:02:14+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 11:02AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the games I've played over Skype, I prefer it when I can just use physical dice and report my results rather than having to use a die-roller (obviously this works better for some games than others). I enjoy the tactile sensation of rolling dice, so having to use automated methods detracts from the gaming experience for me. <br/><br/>For me, the biggest Skype-related problem is crosstalk -- either the actuality (which means neither person can be heard) or the fear of it (which means people hold back because they don't want to drown out someone else). Figuring out the "who talks when" thing can be important to making the game flow well, because you probably won't have body language clues to help you like you would in a face-to-face game. Things like targeting questions or statements to specific people rather than "the group" can help the game flow more smoothly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
