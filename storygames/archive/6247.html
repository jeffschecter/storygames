Who would've thought there would be a nest of story gamers in Auburn-Opelika, Alabama?<br/><br/>We're meeting every Friday night at 8pm CST at my house (creepy turn-of-the-century joint with plenty of room for out-of-town-guest crashing). Consider this an open invitation to attend. We're conveniently located off of I-85 or 280, an hour from Montgomery, an hour-and-a-half from Atlanta, and two hours from Birmingham.<br/><br/>Anyone interested should contact me via email: brennen dot reece at gmail dot com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
