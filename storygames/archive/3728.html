Please be aware that the selection process for choosing judges for the ENnies Awards 2008 is going on <b>NOW!</b><br/><br/>So that the judges can be announced at GenCon, so that publishers can hand off their products at GenCon, so that the Judges have an entire year to read the materials (and maybe for more reasons than that), Judges are going through the election/selection process as we speak.<br/><br/>If you are interested, here are some links for you:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.ennieawards.com/voting.html#2008" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennieawards.com/voting.html#2008</a><br/><a href="http://www.ennieawards.com/judgenominees.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ennieawards.com/judgenominees.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83787/#Comment_83787" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T08:58:10+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  8:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3599&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">mentioned it a little over two weeks ago</a>.

Simply put, the "indie"/story game side of the house doesn't, because publishers can't be judges -- that's Ennie policy.  And given that the indie ethic is "everyone can publish a game", it's not too shocking.  So we have to rely on folks from the other "mainstream" communities who are also keeping an eye on what's developing in the small press scene to give us a fair shake.  Jeramy and Chris definitely did that this year, and they have my backing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83813/#Comment_83813" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-28T16:05:36+00:00" title="July 28, 2007  4:05PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think SG and the Forge have been pretty excited about being invited to play a stronger role in the ENies over the past few years.  But, yeah, like Iago said, most of us are disqualified from being judges, even if the time commitment didn't look pretty forbidding.

To me you're the best thing that has happened the ENnies and you single handedly resolved my biggest criticism - that no one really knows what's going on.  I was always a little skeptical because I could just imagine someone looking at a book and saying "Nope, this doesn't cut it" and tossing it aside without touching it.  Your blog provides insight into the process, makes the process more accessible to the rest of the community, and even serves as an excellent reviewing platform.
