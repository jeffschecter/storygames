There are LOTS of reasons why people at any RPG table might do THAT.  Like, if an announced action:<br/><br/>A) wouldn't logically work, based on the "what"s and "how"s of the fiction<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> wouldn't be suitable to the game's emotional tenor<br/>C) wouldn't be suitable to the game's stylistic idiom<br/>D) would make a participant uncomfortable (lines/veils)<br/>E) wouldn't be conducive to future play for reasons of boring situation<br/>F) wouldn't be conducive to future play for reasons of plot derailment<br/>G) is less cool than something else they thought of<br/>H) violates the system for playing the game (e.g. breaks a rule -- good call, Corley)<br/><br/>Any of these could be asserting a shared value <i>for</i> the group or an individual value <i>upon</i> the group.<br/><br/>"No, that just doesn't work" clearly <i>claims</i> that A is the case (your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> are subsets of that).

Why?<br/><br/>An impressionable young man who's just been torn away from the only life he knows, swept up into a world of shady adventures... that sounds like a guy primed for crude violence to me.<br/><br/>Genre conventions are great! The reason they're great is that it's equally okay to uphold them or subvert them: those are both ways to meaningfully interact with genre.<br/><br/>Having the noble young hero make a bad decision and kill the wrong dude in cold blood is great. The hero's journey is still underway, but now there's this grief and shady backstory looming over the hero. If we treat genre convention as something that we're not supposed to mess around with, it becomes a boring prison.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355378/#Comment_355378" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T19:33:59+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  7:33PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -Here's a reason in a level-based system: the thing you want to do, while basically genre-appropriate, is a goody (or effect thereof) acquirable only at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n-To generalize on that one: the thing you want to do is doable by _someone_ in the system, but letting just _anybody_ do it invalidates the relevance of the choice to be that other person.

I will do it, be utterly open about why I'm doing it, and, as we're using Fate, there's a mechanism for me to do it, but it really is better if I don't do it.<br/><br/>One reason I will do it is, "Er, guys, I actually didn't come up with an answer to that question." In one case, one of my players actually came up with a great answer. But basically, that kind of No is "No, I fucked up. Have a Fate point, and I'll try not to do that again."<br/><br/>The second is the one that's trickier for me, but again, going bluntly meta and saying, "Okay, I want the other players to be able to do something, so I'm going to rule you can't solve all the problems" is usually acceptable.

In that game (conflict resolution, GM's task is mostly about dramatic coordination) I call the standards the GM uses in modulating conflict stakes the triple principle of "leverage, propriety and scope". This is slightly different from Matt's list up top: leverage is the situation where the character is not in position to accomplish what he seeks (jumping to the moon or whatever), propriety is when the action is out of genre for the campaign (simply wishing somebody back to life because you're so much in love with them, to pick a positive example), and scope is when what the player is trying to accomplish is basically achievable, but we don't want to resolve it just yet, with just this one simple action, as it's really going to be more complex and take more attention and processing from us as a group.<br/><br/>I'm pretty happy with the above in the context of TSoY, as I feel that it captures the task of declaring stakes in a pretty analytic manner. Basically, if one of the above standards doesn't conflict with a player's declaration of character intent, then the GM should simply allow it to happen, or go to the dice about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355412/#Comment_355412" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T03:12:43+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  3:12AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>I think GM's say "no, that just doesn't work" for three different reasons, broadly speaking.<br/><br/>1) The action is simply beyond the threshold of plausibility: a relatively normal human trying to leap a 100' chasm.<br/><br/>2) The action would normally work, but there is a legitimate in-world reason why it doesn't in this case, although that reason is hidden from the players at the moment: the house is owned by a dude who's secretly a powerful wizard, so simply using knock to unlock the front door doesn't work.<br/><br/>3) The GM is simply blocking / doesn't want to "lose control" of "the story": the players realize who the bad guy is "too early" and go to confront him, but nothing they do to try to find him works.</blockquote>\nLula points out a fourth category: "Because it would be socially disruptive / break the group's social contract / it's just not your turn even if the idea is cool."<br/><br/>Thoughts?

There really are two very different definitions in operation. The indie gamer's definition, in this context, is "unusually skilled"\u2014that is, that unless you have players and (especially) a DM who are actually quite extraordinary, the game will necessary suck. As in, you don't just have to be engaged and have reasonable social skills and have made a reasonable attempt to understand the game's rules. In order to have a good experience, you must be able to do (much) more than simply apply the rules and principles in the text to the game.<br/><br/>I doubt that's what you meant, of course, Zak. I think you meant more like, "reasonably competent." GM is well-prepared and understands the game and is ready to teach it to new players (or parcel out such duties appropriately), players are basically cooperative and good-humored, don't spotlight hog, etc.<br/><br/>The pressure to be a "good" (read: amazing! awesome! stupendous!) GM among many trad groups can actually work against becoming a "good" (can competently run a fun game consistently) GM. This was and to an extent still is certainly an issue with, for example, the group I gamed with in college. The "GM-as-auteur" model was very much the dominant paradigm, so when I started running games there (D&amp;D 3.0), I tried really hard to put in all this "deep" stuff about metaphysics, thematic choices, and other such grandiose and pretentious bullshit. Whereas if I had been culturally able to ignore all that and simply focus on the nuts and bolts, both I and the people playing in my game would have had a much better time!<br/><br/>And it's *that* pressure that many of us self-identified "indie gamers" stand against. And, of course, the OSR also demands competent (but not insanely brilliant!) GMing, so we're all good as far as that goes. But there are legions of gamers who grew up in the era when the ideals of "being a true Storyteller" and other such hogwash* were regularly promoted in the GMing advice sections of all published RPGs.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*It's not complete hogwash. I do know one or two people who can do it, but even they have off-days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355607/#Comment_355607" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T19:46:08+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  7:46PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2012 7:47PM by Zak S.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess my point is more that such fine distinctions never even came up or mattered in the experience I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were:<br/>\n1. good smart people who were good, smart GMs and thus fun was had,<br/>\n<br/>\nand there were<br/>\n<br/>\n2.people I didn't know, didn't like and wouldn't roll with in the first place<br/>\n<br/>\nand that was the entire spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am learning that every shade of grey apparently exists out there in the rest of the planet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355643/#Comment_355643" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T00:23:57+00:00" title="January 24, 2012 12:23AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>That sort of thing isn't once in a blue moon when you're a hardcore "macho Narr" masochist and play lots of games that deal with sensitive real-world issues.<br/><br/>Matt</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Or if you play Poison'd!</blockquote>\nI know that was a semi-facetious response, but....can't we just leave these things to personal responsibility?

When "good play" goes against what the rules say. <br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>Also something that is maybe getting lost in this discussion is that there are various subjective values of "good". Someone's "best DM ever" might run a game that would suck for me personally. So even with "good" players and a DM, not everyone is necessarily going to have fun with them, because they have a different expectation of what a good game is.<br/><br/>Like, I know for a fact that some people just want to sit there and listen to the GM telling a story, acting their characters from time to time. So their definition of a good player is "a good thespian that goes along with the GM's cues" and their definition of a good GM is "a good illusionist and storyteller". I would <i>hate</i> (or at least be bored senseless) to sit in that game, not matter how good they were, for their value of good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355664/#Comment_355664" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T03:15:20+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  3:15AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and ontopic, because the above was pure digression.<br/><br/>I think saying "no" necessarily relates to "what we're doing here".

I think we've all been there - and it can be as simple as something like price. Once in a recent session I quoted a price to rent a "clean" car for criminal activities and the players (rightly) protested that there was no way it would cost that much. I agreed and changed my mind.<br/><br/>I wonder if we could come up with a list of situations in which it's acceptable for the players to say "no", and situations in which it's not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355799/#Comment_355799" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T15:24:16+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  3:24PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night, I remember saying no in two different cases. One was "No, don't spend that fate point now -- wait until I give you all the information" with a coda of "so, you are supposed to get the fate point, not pay it". This was... mm, sort of a Robert's Rules of Order thing, or an info-dump equivalent of initiative rules. We were purely in the realm of mechanics, so there were clear guidelines, and either side could call the other on fuckups.<br/><br/>The second was "No, this is not your scene, and the player whose scene it is has no problem coming up with ideas, and you do not get to take more screen time by pushing into his scene to give him your out of character advice, especially on mechanics issues, when he is just as competent as you are at finding the loopholes." This is also the case where exact context is important and might take me twenty minutes to explain, as a lot of it boils down to I know these players, I know I'm not crushing anyone's psyche, and there's enough pie to go around. The player on whose behalf I spoke could and would have called me on it if he had wanted the advice. I have empirical evidence of this.<br/><br/>But, both were meta, not "Your PC can't do X". Both were some flavor of "Wait your turn", if very different ones. One was, "No, wait, because you don't know all the facts yet", while the other was, "No, wait, your fellow gamer does know all the facts."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355811/#Comment_355811" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-24T16:10:59+00:00" title="January 24, 2012  4:10PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about:<br/>\n<br/>\n"No because you are drunk and next time we roll you won't remember you wanted to do that and you'll blame _me_ for your character being dead in a ditch with 'John Stamos Rules' tattooed across her stomach so maybe we should stop now or at least you should."<br/>\n<br/>\nMight fall under category 4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355865/#Comment_355865" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T05:04:36+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  5:04AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>What about:<br/><br/>"No because you are drunk and next time we roll you won't remember you wanted to do that and you'll blame _me_ for your character being dead in a ditch with 'John Stamos Rules' tattooed across her stomach so maybe we should stop now or at least you should."</blockquote>\nActually, I had something similar to that, but less, um, dire.

That's fine, we walked him through the idea and he got it.  The stranger thing that we hadn't detected through all this was that he didn't know what a comic book was like.  He continually behaved as if he were playing some member of the Street Fighter video game genre and resisted our too-subtle attempts to guide him in what the fiction was supposed to be like.  When I eventually asked him if he'd ever read a comic book, he told us he hadn't.  We didn't end a campaign over it or anything, but it was an awfully trying game session and I don't think any of us are idiots or horrible social misfits or whatever.

More than just a nice guy misjudging things. <br/><br/>Otherwise I'm not sure why "let's just pretend that didn't happen and start over again" wasn't an option?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358414/#Comment_358414" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T22:46:51+00:00" title="February  8, 2012 10:46PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the category of "Because it would be socially disruptive / break the group's social contract / it's just not your turn even if the idea is cool.", I said, "No, you cannot go right to the villain's lair at 2am because you'd be leaving one PC out of the action, and that's not right. Here's a Fate point. Go and collect him, and then you can go right to the villain's lair (at 3am or whatever)."<br/><br/>Regarding "How does this shit happen?": How the shit happens varies. Often, it involves things snowballing over time until the situation is so tangled up that no one knows what to do. Often, it involves one person being an unabashed jerk and other people caught off balance by this. If you're off balance and unable to react correctly, fast, it's hard to figure out what to do after the situation ends, but the problem continues. Think of any dysfunctional situation -- at work, in a relationship, whatever -- and translate it to gaming.<br/><br/>From the outside, it is baffling. After the fact, it may be baffling to the people involved. As it is happening, if you're not very centered and sure of yourself (and, let us presume, more or less in the right, just to keep things simple), you can't freeze time and get your head together. You're not necessarily making the most logical and optimal move. It may or may not be clear what that move is from outside, presuming it exists, but from inside, a lot of people, including Yours Truly, just won't see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
