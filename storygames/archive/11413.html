There's a new games director and there's an opening for more stuff but I don't know what to offer or expect.  This is not about me (I have an Eternal Membership and I live in town).  It's about trying to get some of you guys who are interested there and making it good for everyone.<br/><br/>If you need more info just email me    saintandsinner *dot* jmj at the gmail.    <br/><br/>Thanks, Scott                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
