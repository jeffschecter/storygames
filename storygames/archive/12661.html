Our tales has two-three sentences, often with a deadly ending, and with a chic 'snippety!' to end it. My son has been very enthusiastic about it, and me, the old man, have followed in his joyful steps like a thirsty dog sniffing pocketfuls of happiness.<br/><br/>Example\n<ul>\n<li>The son: <i>Once upon a time there lived a daddy so bald, and then he got a biiig stone on his head and died! Snippety!</i></li>\n<li>The father: <i>Once upon a time a little boy was a toy, and it broke! Snippety!</i></li>\n<li>The son: <i>Once upon a time a daddy had a toy that grew and grew and grew, and then it ate the dad and burped! Snippety!</i></li>\n<li>and on we go ...</li>\n</ul>\nIt is mostly silly or teasing, and then there are moments of pure poetry or insight. It is a kind of story-game for two, with an incredibly simple method:\n<ol>\n<li> Keep it short; two or three sentences.</li>\n<li> Let the surroundings inspire the tales.</li>\n<li> Be frank and free in what you tell, and be not afraid of the burlesque!</li>\n<li> End it with a 'snippety'!</li>\n<li> Let the co-player respond with his/her own tale.</li>\n<li> Respond to your co-player with your own tale.</li>\n<li> Keep on until you tire, or laugh too much to go on.</li>\n</ol>\nInvite a playful partner and have a go at it! ;-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284340/#Comment_284340" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T17:13:07+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  5:13PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2010 6:47PM by mease19.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For some reason your example really struck my funny bone.

It's exactly as simple as that. The one thing not shown in the example is how we may turn the theme from murdering figures conspicuously similar to the opponent, and towards elements in the surroundings, and more freewheeling stories.<br/><br/>Like this:\n<ul>\n<li>The son: Once upon a time a daddy fed a duck, with himself! Snippety!</li>\n<li>The father: Once upon a time a duck felt lonely, but then it found a cat and they had flying cats for babies! Snippety!</li>\n<li>The son: Once a flying cat flew to the moon, and built a house there, and then all the cats in the whole world lived in that house! And they had lots of mouse! Snippety!</li>\n<li>The father: Once upon a time a cat talked to the other cats. He told them they were beautiful. And that made all the cats grow wings and fly to the moon. Snippety!</li>\n<li>The son: Once upon a time the moon fell down, and a boy played soccer with it, and scored, and he became the world champion! And he won the gold medal! And the worlds biggest diamond! Snippety!</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\nWe did it again yesterday, lying on a floating mattress in a lake in the woods (nice, warm water).

Yes, it is wonderful, and really great to do with children; they get so enthusiastic it makes you tick ...<br/><br/>On "snippety"; well ... actually we are doing it in Norwegian; where the traditional ending of fairy tales is <i>"Snipp-snapp-snute, s\xe5 var eventyret ute!"</i> (on-the-fly translation: "Snitch-snatch-snout, and then the tale went out!"). So my son and me have used "Snipp-snapp!" - to make a short and cool ending for our tales, as it also mimics the sound of scissors (in a cartoonish way). "Snippety" got some of the same qualities. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285006/#Comment_285006" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T16:26:52+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  4:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must be far too young and mean-spirited to enjoy this; I'm not feeling a wave of paternal love here. <br/><br/>That said, cool stuff Tomas.
