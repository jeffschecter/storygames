Let me know if someone's already done this.  In this game, the only outcomes of any conflict-resolution mechanic are life or death.  Your character sheet is just a set of three lists.  List <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> contains a few things which, if any are present in a scene, will lead to your definite and final death.  List <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> contains a few things which, if any are present in a scene containing any items from List <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, have the potential to prevent your death through a mechanic of some kind.  List <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> contains a few things which, if present in a scene, will guarantee your not-death.<br/><br/>Haven't really taken it any further than that, because this delicious curry has demanded more of my personal attention.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
