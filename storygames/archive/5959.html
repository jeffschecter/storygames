I'm now getting everything together for Indie Games Explosion and Games on Demand.  I don't have a whole lot of specifics yet but I do want to let everyone know that these things are going to be happening.  I also want to gauge what kind of interest there is out there.  So, here's the kind of preliminary information I'd like to have from folks.  <br/><br/>If you want to run a game associated with the Indie Games Explosion, let me know.  Give me just the generalities at the moment.  If you have a specific game in mind, that's great.  If you just know you want to run something and have it narrowed down to 1 or 2 things, that's still fine at this point.  I'll get back with you about about deadlines on when I actually need to know what it is specifically you're doing.<br/><br/>If you are interested in being a Table Custodian for Games on Demand, let me know.  This is a really cool job.  I did it in 2006 and had a blast.  For this, I just need to know that you're interested.  There are no "set" games here.  I do need to know what games you could comfortably run in a pick-up session.<br/><br/>I do know that GM's (or Table Custodians) get a free badge to the Con if they run a certain number of sessions over the weekend.  That number used to be 3 sessions.  I'm reading through stuff at the Con right now and will find out if that number has changed or not.<br/><br/>To contact me, you can reply to this thread but I need you to email  me at aecooper AT musfiber DOT com.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Andrew                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133145/#Comment_133145" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T04:41:20+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  4:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, I just want to say thanks for organizing this!

Indie Game Explosion is the overall event which includes the GoD event(s), and any indie events that people want to get on the schedule. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor GoD, we (I hope that I'm not being presumptuous in including myself in "we") have tables that are assigned for long chunks of the day or all day. With many thanks to the most understanding and accomodating Peter Adkison and crew. The activity at GoD is largely that you walk up, start talking with the other potential players mingling about, and somebody says something like, "Hey, I'd love to play some InSpectres or Dust Devils." Discussion ensues until enough players there agree to play something. There is a person assigned at all times as the "Table Custodian" who does the administration for the event. Meaning that they help people organize into games, get space on the tables, take tickets, etc. They put you at a table, take tickets, and you play. <br/>\n<br/>\nTheoretically the custodian is supposed to attempt to accomodate whatever requests he gets for games, but practically speaking it's just up to whatever the people who are present feel comfortable running (Rich Forrest actually manged to badger me into running The Fantasy Trip, of all things, last year). The "on demand" part refers less to being able to play whatever you want, and more whenever you want with whomever you want who is available to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is great for filling in gaps on your schedule, or just "freeforming" your attendance at the Con. Schedule only those "must play" events, and then create events as you need to. Or just "discover" them. Some people fear that they won't be able to fill out their time doing this, or won't be able to find something they want to play this way. But I can tell you that from what I've seen nobody has had any trouble. In fact, rather the opposite, you get this, "Oh man, I wish I could be at three tables at once" effect. You get really torn between which games to play that are forming up. <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrew, Jonathan, put me down as definitely attending the theory roundtable (Push should definitely be a sponsor of this). Also please put me down as a table custodian with enough sessions to get a badge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI see on Kat's site that there's going to be an explosion at Origins, too? Awesome. I'm in for that, too!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133225/#Comment_133225" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T09:19:04+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  9:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>his will be my first GenCon.

Shower. Grab a granola bar. Head to the Con.<br/>9:00 By this time I'm at the con. My eyes are bleary, so I'm wearing my sunglasses. I approach the green tables (about 5), to see that Mike Holmes, Eruditus, a few others are there, talking. I sit down, say "mornin' ", and shoot the shit for about 30 minutes or so.<br/>9:30 or thereabouts: The conversation drifts to gaming. People talk about what they want to play. More people have joined or are walking by. People start offering up games.<br/>10:00 or so: Folks have split up: Gaming is happening at two tables. Two folks who just woke up/arrived are talking bleary-eyed at one of the tables, waiting for hangover/ehaustion to subside, and plan to grab the next few folks into a game of whatever.<br/><br/>The next 7 hours or so are a blur of Hippe Game, talking (about general stuff, or gaming), hanging out, playing classic games like The Fantasy Trip, D&amp;D, Tunnels and Trolls, etc.<br/>There's also a bulleting board where people can announce games and create "sign up posts" for them. Until Thursday I had no definite game-running plans. By that afternoon I planned three sessions at various times that weekend, and posted sign-in postit notes announcing those games ("X at 2:00 here! Who's interested?") etc.<br/><br/>It was honestly like a mini-con inside a con. It was cool for me because I got to hang out and meet a lot of my online acquaintances, but also because I could run and play stuff, freely, without having to have it registered in triplicate 7 MONTHS EARLIER. The "plan a game the day of/the day before" style suits me much better, and this area was totally like that.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133235/#Comment_133235" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T09:33:22+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  9:33AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to have a better time at GOD this year than I did last year.

I'm going to be going over the the threads on the Forge from last year and noting what worked and what didn't.  I've got Kat and Mike available to me as resources on how things have been done in the past.  With that to draw on, I'm going to try and keep what worked, improve what I can and throw out what obviously didn't work well.  As the time gets closer and closer, I'll be posting (here and/or elsewhere) on what you can do to make GoD awesome for you.

What works better at GOD is prepping something you want to run, just like a scheduled event, and then seeing if you can grab a group that wants to play.  Or bugging the guy who wrote / is good at running Game X until they agree to run it for you.  The "wander in, pick something to play, play it" strategy only works for games that are super supportive of pick up / improvised play (which is still a fair number of games, Shock:, the Roach, 1001 Nights, PTA, Universalis, etc.).<br/><br/>That said, I see GOD through the lens of JiffyCon and Story Games Boston, which operate very much along this model, just with set time slots.  A bunch of people prep games and then we sort out who's going to play what.  So, take that with a grain of salt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133263/#Comment_133263" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T11:59:02+00:00" title="March  7, 2008 11:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have much in the way of solutions for you, Jason. I'm thinking that we could try to recruit dedicated GMs for slots in addition to the table custodians. This would broaden the range of games available (likely), and ensure that there are people enough to run games for more folks if they come along. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe can, of course, ask that people make this a team event, and not to poach players from each other. I hope I didn't steal anybody's players... I know I've given up players in the past in order that other games can run. This is the spirit of the event. Making sure the maximum number of players get to have the sort of good time that they decide they want. That includes GMs. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut outside of this all, I think that you're stuck largely with simply asking as many people to participate as possible, as well as possible. And hoping. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe packets were a grand effort, and I'm sorry it didn't work out. I think that the pick-up nature of this situation makes that impractical on the spot, however. As somebody said, if we were to organize this ahead of time, perhaps. But, really, nothing really prepares me to play a game like running it first. If I haven't, then I may well not feel comfortable running it at the con. Well-prepared packet or no. At the very least I'll want to have played it recently before the con (if not run it). <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps we could get people to accept packets from you, as training to be ready? Still got the packets?

Part of that was also working the Ashcan Front booth &amp; some of the podcasting stuff, so I didn't really get to visit GOD except when I was a custodian.<br/><br/>I would suggest that there be clearly posted rules on the whole GenCon ticket issue.  I had some folks last year that got pissed with me because I told them that their three-hour game would cost two tickets per player, not one.

Here's how I did it:<br/><br/>On Thursday I went to the GOD area with the goal of putting up a note on the bulletin board about planning to run a game at a specific time on Friday. (I do like the GOD "on demand" spontaneity paradigm, but because of the booth I needed to arrange when I'd be away, so that's why I decided on the note method for scheduling the game.) When I got there I saw that TonyLB had posted a note about planning to run a game, and that he'd put little spaces on it for people to sign up. That struck me as a very good idea. So I wrote up my note, with four spaces for names, specifying that I would run My Life with Master, Lacuna, or a playtest of The Niche Engine, "a game I've been developing," at my available timeslot and that we'd decide which game as a group. When I showed up on Friday there was a full slate of player names on the note, none of whom I knew (which was awesome). And to my surprise, the game they chose was the playtest. They were great, and it was a blast. And so I'll have Ashcan Front booth commitments again but I'm really hoping to arrange two games this same way this year.<br/><br/>Andrew, If there's one request I have for GOD this year, it's that the location be publicized in advance somehow and that bulletin board and Sharpies and Post-its be ready on Wednesday so myself and others can potentially get games organized for Thursday via notes on the board.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133344/#Comment_133344" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T15:26:43+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  3:26PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll certainly be submitting some games to Gen Con and I'd very much like them to be part of the IGE.
