In this episode, we read and respond to an email from Judd, share the last of our recording with Andy Kitkowski about his Game Chef entry, and discuss the end of the Dungeon and Dragon magazines.  We also mention Jason Morningstar a few times (and I hope he takes it well).<br/><br/>I'm pretty happy with the interplay between all three hosts in this episode.  We're starting to gel and show our talents.<br/><br/>You can subscribe to the show through iTunes by looking for canonpuncture or look for the listing under the Other Games section.
