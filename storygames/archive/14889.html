(Wished +Jim Crocker could have shown up an hour earlier!) I found myself having a frustrating go at the 1950s retro-pulp sci-fi game. Read the game if you'd like: it's available for free at the attached link.<br/><br/>For reference, Eppy played the Robot Detective AP3-13, Bryant played the Ghost Warrior Tecumseh, Erik played The Solar Sage, a Mystic Explorer, Grant played the Psychic Daredevil Forethought, and Maya played the Two-Fisted Commando Buff "McMan" Huge.<br/><br/>In a conversation with the above and +Emily Care Boss in the parking lot, I isolated the three main problems where John may be able to intervene:<br/><br/>* Lack of relationships among the Danger Patrol:<br/><br/>You pick your Style and Role and then...? You're expected to come up with all the interesting backstory between you and the other characters. That's cool, except when the system otherwise promotes you creating an individual monad character that can do a certain limited array of things. That places us firmly in D&amp;D 4E territory, where the players then look to the GM for plot, leading me to...<br/><br/>* The GM has to do too much goddamn work:<br/><br/>So I've got to make a bunch of index cards for everything important that everyone says, keep track of all the bits of fiction mentioned in the "Previously On Danger Patrol..." section without imposing my own "vision" on the action, and then have to come up with a bunch of backstory as the players look to me to provide the transition between Action \u2013 Interlude \u2013 Suspense sequences? No way! I'm either handed a pile of pre-encoded opportunities to apply pressure on the characters (i.e. Fronts, Vulnerabilities, Whatever) or the players have to be incentivized to come up with their own adversity. I'm otherwise too busy TRACKING adversity for me to be INVENTING it anew to match PC specifications. When I'm the guy keeping the game rolling and coming up with all the ideas, there's something wrong here. There was a definite attitude of "Entertain me! I dare you!" \u2013 a reactive rather than a proactive stance \u2013 encouraged by the game that I couldn't rightly qualify.<br/><br/>* Interlude scenes crash and burn:<br/><br/>Given the lack of relationships, it was hard to keep the Danger Patrol characters from either launching into another Action sequence or immediately start investigating the threat (Suspense). The only incentive to have an Interlude scene for this group was, obviously, the fact that you recover some of your Danger meter and some Equipment/Abilities. People were way more eager to mark off their stats than role-play towards relationships, clues, etc. There has to be a way of making the refresh of various stats tied in with different RP activities. (Recovering your Danger meter? Tell us how you accidentally reveal something to your fellow DP members about your life outside the DP). The Interlude scenes definitely rely on a different, genre-related meta-game logic than the Action scenes, which are more confrontational (Hey! You're being attacked by flying bunnies. What do you do?). It requires a knowledge of pulp that, quite evidently, was by no means uniform across the table.<br/><br/>On the bright side, however, Danger Patrol is one of the few games that makes me as a GM really eager for Action and Combat, because it's a LOT of fun and the stuff in-between has been otherwise deprived of its protein.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338408/#Comment_338408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T09:32:23+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  9:32AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's some suggestions for next time:<br/><br/>For the relationships and Interludes, if the players can't think of any clever connections between each other, aside from that they're on the same team, then just assume they're professional relationships only. Lots of the 40s and 50s source material has NOTHING connecting characters aside from their goals as a team. Then, when doing interludes, use those as a chance for the characters to tie up loose ends, declare where they're heading next, etc.<br/>When it comes to the players looking to the GM for the plot, they need to be told that they're writing part of the script, themselves. The "Previously On" bits are the time when they get to think of things they want to see introduced, themes they like and don't like, etc. This can be a bit of a learning curve for some people, but shouldn't be insurmountable.<br/><br/>As for the GM needing to do so much work? I think you may be overthinking what the GM needs to do. As the players are doing their "Previously on" bits, just write down the details you think are interesting on some notecards, and set it down on the table. There's very little that needs keeping track of. And as you go, when the players bring up ideas or musings that you think sound good, write them down, too. Then they'll suddenly be, "Oh, we just hit on something important!"<br/><br/>For me, Danger Patrol is the lowest-prep game I've ever had to run on a regular basis. My starting scenarios are simply a slam-bang intro with stuff happening all over, and a few threat cards placed on the table. I don't even need to detail them too much, as the game encourages making stuff up on the fly. Add more stuff as the players come up with their own ideas, and just run from there. Need a new villain? Introduce "Shady Guy with a Strange Chrome Arm." What does he do? Who knows? We find that out as we go. I've never had to sweat the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338424/#Comment_338424" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T10:36:02+00:00" title="August 12, 2011 10:36AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can probably come up with a half-dozen issues I have with the Danger Patrol beta, but the GM having to do too much work is not one of them for me.  I actually make more work for myself in the form of pre-play preparation of materials just because there's so little actual prep or work that the GM has to do for the game.<br/><br/>Aside from the players helping to build the situation through the danger die mechanic and the general principals behind the danger meter, the main thing I like about Danger Patrol is how much of the game is put in the players' hands.  It's one of a handful of games with a GM I'd just as happily run as play.<br/><br/>Interlude scenes may very well crash and burn if you don't establish some small threads of relationship between the characters before the game begins.  I do this by asking leading questions about how/when the members joined the team, how they feel about the other members of their team, etc.  I find the Roles suggestive to this end.  <br/><br/>I tend to do this in most games I run whether or not there's great textual/mechanical guidance.  I think I got better at this recently from running and watching others run Apocalypse World.  For Danger Patrol, I had the benefit of having John run it for me and seeing the kinds of questions he asked prior to the session beginning.  Well, and to be honest, playing with folks that were just itching to jump in and establish their characters and their characters' relationships with one another.  There're a couple good notes on this in the beta document, but I agree it might be stronger.<br/><br/>Danger Patrol Gamma's current direction, as I understand it, might even end up eliminating Interlude scenes in moving towards more of a 4E/Ravenloft/Ashardalon construction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338466/#Comment_338466" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T13:34:29+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  1:34PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few thoughts.<br/><br/>Yeah, the interludes and (especially) suspense scenes probably need some more structure.  This is a known thing.  It's in beta!<br/><br/>I've never thought the GM in Danger Patrol had too much to do, so I'm not sure what to say on that front.  You just listen to the "last time ons" and segway to the characters in the midst of some awesome catastrophe.  I'm not sure what you mean by either "tracking adversity" or "inventing new stuff to match PC expectations."  I've also never felt like it was my job to entertain the players, so clearly we've had pretty different experiences running it.<br/><br/>That said, relationships -- in the form of something like the Hx questions in AW -- would be an easy thing to add if you thought it would be helpful.  I mean, in my experience, the "last time ons" sometimes do this for you, yeah?  "Last time on Danger Patrol, the psychic commando and I were imprisoned by the warrior ant people of Theti Omega!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338481/#Comment_338481" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T14:32:09+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  2:32PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback, Evan!

But enough slander.  In any case, several of the players weren't tying enough interesting details to keep everyone engaged, so I increasingly felt like my documentation of their own ideas was a waste of time when <i>they weren't particularly interested in those threats/clues which they came up with</i>.<br/><br/>I mean, the themes I had to deal with were: Bunnies are cute. Their eggs suck the power out of robots.  They have formed together as a giant mustached man.<br/><br/>So I'm like: "Cool. You're on your way to fight the mustached man."  I made up a 100-foot tall humanoid made of bunny eggs, several flying bunny squads and civilians caught in the middle.<br/><br/>After this was done, the plot began to pull at the seams.  One player discovered it was the Neptunians.  Others discovered it was the Stygians, and was more right.  But then someone mentioned that the mustached man was supposed to have looked like Stalin, and was all a ruse by the CR.  My brain was a-spin during the first Interlude scene, and I tried to rein it in a little on the Suspense sequence.  So I jerked them toward the Palace of Paranoia, the episode title and where some of the mad architects of Rocket City live (a la <i>Top Ten</i>) for an Action sequence.  Well, they certainly wanted one of those, as did I, but nobody could really agree why they were there.<br/><br/>I haven't been that bored as a GM (while working hard to please the players) in a long time.  And this for a game to which I said "Dude, I'm totally running <i>that</i>!" which is why all the pathos now. :-P<br/><br/>Keep in mind that I've been running Story Games since 2005 and am regularly to be found running InSpectres, which has a similarly plot-generating impulse.  But at those tables I (usually) don't have problems with players expecting the world from me...<br/><br/>Anyways, thanks for hearing me out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338524/#Comment_338524" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T19:58:34+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  7:58PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Attack of the Giant Easter Commie, huh?<br/>Sounds like these players really don't have the mindset for a game like DP. I mean, when they grasp for ideas every now and then, that shouldn't be so bad, especially if they can pow-wow with the other players for inspiration.

"Lack of relationships among the Danger Patrol"<br/>I agree that this is true, but I haven't seen it as a problem - It's never been my expectation that characters have meaningfully connected back-stories.<br/>In games I've played and ran, the characters were pretty disparate, and the genre allowed for it.<br/>Perhaps the game would benefit from a shout-out note in the text, which addresses how interconnected the characters should be.<br/><br/>2.) "Too much goddam GM work"<br/>I agree, that the GM has to introduce a lot of threats. Sometimes, when you're writing your 10th index card in a scene, you feel exasperated with the process.<br/>One thing I've observed in others running the game is that the game benefits from keeping initial situations simple, and new threats simple too.<br/>"There's a gorilla attacking the bank! And over here, three lazer spiders are terrorizing traffic! One of the cars in the traffic is carrying the President." Done. No more detail to start.<br/>New threats should be equally simple: "The gorilla's trainer shows up, and attempts to take all the money from the bank!"<br/>John's examples in the text look really complex, compared to how simple I've seen it be in play. Those examples should get simplified.<br/><br/>As far as keeping track of stuff, when I GM this game, I write down a few words from each "Previously on..."<br/>-Ex Lover: Pirate?<br/>-Data Bank Malfunction<br/>-Evil Space Dogs<br/>-Why are lazer cats sexy?<br/><br/>And then when I need a new threat, I glance at those, and try to shoehorn one in.<br/><br/>3.) "Interlude scenes suck"<br/>Yeah, they do. I'm glad they're being cut from the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tork" title="tork"><img alt="tork" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tork">tork</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338541/#Comment_338541" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T21:45:49+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  9:45PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Evan, did you start the session with an opening teaser? It doesn't really sound like you did.  The opening teaser establishes the basic situation for the first action scene before the gamemaster solicits input from the players through their "Previously, On Danger Patrol!" monologues. The details you note down as the players do their monologues don't have to be worked into the first action scene - just use any that work well with the teaser, and then look for opportunities to work in the others as the game progresses. My usual pattern is to work the player details into later suspense scenes, revealing them as the dark forces behind various calamitous events that have befallen Rocket City. Working this stuff in before the players have had time to interact and generate some plot is much harder.<br/><br/>Aside from that, though, it sounds like at least some of the players weren't particularly excited about Danger Patrol. The ingredients you're describing don't really show much respect or enthusiasm for Danger Patrol's source material - they're more the sort of loony stuff I'm used to seeing from players who are bored and engaging in sabotage. <br/><br/>In any event, I didn't come on tonight to critique your Danger Patrol game, I was coming on to respond to your original post.<br/><br/><b><i>Lack of relationships among the Danger Patrol/Interlude scenes crash and burn</i></b><br/><br/>I'm putting these two issues together because in my opinion, the second problem is mostly caused by the first.  It's really hard to figure out what to do with the first few interlude scenes because the characters aren't interconnected, and there's not enough back story established for fruitful flashbacks.  If you run Danger Patrol on an ongoing basis, though, the interludes quickly become pretty awesome. One thing I've found can be helpful in providing fodder for early interludes is using one threat in the first action scene that is interpersonal in nature, or at least internal to one of the characters. This is something that happened more or less by accident in some of my early Danger Patrol games, and which I thought would prove to be a disaster, but proved to be pretty entertaining in play, and provided a starting point for interludes. In one game, one of the threats in the action arena was a character's crippling fear of heights. In another, it was an extra-dimensional character's inability to comprehend human communication. Mechanically, they presented threats which would lead to disaster if not addressed, which makes decent relationship/story fodder, and they gave the characters something to bitch at each other about during interludes.<br/><br/>Something I'm planning to try in my next Danger Patrol game is specifically asking the players to come up with a melodramatic relationship issue we can use as a threat in the first action scene, giving the game a sort of silver-age Marvel quality.  I'm thinking of things like 'Agent D3-TCT has come to doubt that a woman such as Cosmo Girl could truly feel love for an artificial man, constructed of cold iron', or 'Captain Astro has become addicted to moon lotus extract. Will his abuse of this diabolical drug spell doom for Danger Patrol?'<br/><br/>I've been tinkering with this because I'd like to have more consistently awesome interludes, but it's worth noting (as others do above) that Danger Patrol's source material isn't particularly character-driven, it's all desperate battles and daring rescues, with brief interruptions to figure out the mastermind's diabolical plan.<br/><br/><i><b>The GM has to do too much goddamn work</b></i><br/>This one, I don't think should really be true. Danger Patrol is really intense in play, and demands a lot of creative energy from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everybody</span> at the table, but it's incredibly low prep.  It's important to remember that the plots of the pulp stories Danger Patrol was inspired by are often paper-thin and shoddy, and that the causal relationships between events are often incredibly tenuous.  You don't really need much more than diabolical laughter, moustache-twirling, and a deathion beam for a good Danger Patrol plot.<br/><br/>One of the keys to success in Danger Patrol is to slightly overload the players with threats, so they'll really be scrabbling for Danger Dice, and to then push them hard when they're coming up with danger details.  If they offer up a danger detail that's not going to make the fiction more entertaining, reject it. Tell them 'That doesn't sound very dangerous! You've gotta raise the stakes!' When they come up with awesome danger, celebrate it! Tell them how badass they are. In my experience, the players always rise to the occasion, and do most of the work for me.<br/><br/>To be clear, when I talk about overloading the players with threats, what I mean is that it's generally a good idea to have one or two countdown threats that the players will have a very hard time knocking down in time, and that additionally, it usually works really well to start the scene with one more threat than the total number of PCs (or more, depending on how many characters have ways to attack multiple threats in the same round) This drives the aforementioned scrambling for Danger Dice, and gives you a good shot at getting a disaster out of the scene, which will provide good fodder for later scenes.  When I don't do this, I end up having to work really hard to make the game entertaining.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338542/#Comment_338542" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-12T21:49:20+00:00" title="August 12, 2011  9:49PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>Gamma is going in a slightly different direction (no "scene types" or Interludes for one thing) </blockquote>\nAny chance you can drop some science on how scenes are handled in the Gamma?
