I'm sure several attendees will go down the nostalgia rabbit hole, but I want to do something different (partly because <i>now</i> is the best time of my life, as far as RPGs are concerned) and I'm considering bringing a sample of <i>Sorcerer</i>, my own <i>Everway</i> hack/remake and possibly <i>Witch Quest</i>.<br/>However, and probably not as originally, I'm also considering hosting a dungeon crawl - the kind of dungeon delve I was never able to pull off as a teenager, but you guys have shown me can be done.<br/>I'm now thinking of a similar event I was a player in at a strictly Forge-indie oriented convention a few years ago: emphasis on navigating a dungeon using a ten-foot pole, evading dangerous encounters, caring which way a door swings before you first try and open it, monsters oozing onto you from the ceiling, that kind of stuff. The ruleset in use was some or some other D&amp;D out of a red-colored box. I was one of three people total (DM included) who were entertained, amongst a bunch of players who were bored to hell - both touchy-feely people and swashbuckling-adventure people allied in lamenting the game's emphasis on avoidance (one's bottom line was: "The only game where, when a hint of story seems to be coming at you, you turn and run". I'm still LOLling to that). In my opinion, the only problem with that game was that the dungeon was too large (20-something rooms!) to even hope to carefully explore in the allotted time slot (4 hours or so).<br/><br/>Similarly, I'd like to run something which isn't about drama (neither in the deep emotional sense or in the action-adventure sense) as much as about cleverly interacting with the smallest features of a self-contained environment.<br/>For a ruleset, I'm considering <i>Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> 1st edition or possibly the Italian <i>Tunnel e Troll</i> (a mid-80s translation of 5th edition which, interestingly enough, came from a big-name all-purpose publishing house), both to avoid some of the complex cultural baggage gamers attach to the D&amp;D brand and because I like the abstract melee combat rules (I'm hoping that less emphasis on what your guy does in a fight, blow by blow, translates to more emphasis on what your team does in the dungeon). Also, I've never had a chance to actually play T&amp;T, despite owning a couple different versions of the rules. <small>An alternative I've considered is a modified <i>Dread</i>, but I know I won't have the time to pull that off.</small> Anyway, that's the <i>easy</i> part: if anything, I only have too much in the way of choice.<br/>What's hard:<ul>\n<li>I don't really expect to have the time to design a dungeon, nor any significant experience <i>successfully</i> doing so (I've drawn a lot of dungeons throughout my life, for games I definitely wouldn't count as my role-playing successes).</li>\n<li>The game has to fit in a 3-hour convention slot, complete with any explanations of principle, character creation, buying equipment for the delve, etc.</li></ul>\nI'd love a suggestion of a dungeon which can perform well under the above time constraints: either a published product, your own tried-and-tested notes from successful play or whatever.<br/>I'm thinking, not a large number of rooms. Something with a number of branches is fine, it just means that not all of the prepped material is going to be used. But a more-or-less linear dungeon of a dozen rooms, where the only treasures are to be found in rooms 9-12 after traversing a minimum of 6 other rooms, isn't cool. I'd like to be able to describe the dungeon in vivid detail, which in my opinion requires a smaller number of rooms over a large number of mostly-similar ones.<br/>I hope we won't just have to call the game to an end after 3 hours with everybody feeling like nothing has happened. I'd also love it if the players, some time in our second hour or play or so, had found something worth their time, and the choice was really on the table whether to head back early or delve deeper. But, above all, I want <i>them</i>, not me, to be in charge of the pacing - so whatever happens happens.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463182/#Comment_463182" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T12:55:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2017 12:55PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I would do in your stead would be to shuffle through the One Page Dungeon contest entries until I got to something that felt intuitively interesting - striking imagery, clean layout, the proper sort of tactical intrigue.

If you have three hours to play, any time spent on character generation (including gearing up) is an enormous waste of time. If you're looking for OSR simplicity, I'd recommend Swords and Wizardy. <a href="http://osr.smolderingwizard.com/cgi-bin/random_snw_wb_char" rel="nofollow">Here's a link to a S&amp;W Whitebox character generator.</a><br/><br/>Just be warned to print out extra characters if you're doing OSR. The high lethality of the system means you're going to have character deaths (to be on the safe side, I'd plan three characters per player). Keep an idea of how you can pull new characters in during the game without long delays.<br/><br/>For dungeons, I had a blast with Caves of Chaos. The module is a bit long for one session, so I'd recommend pushing the party to explore one section of the caves (probably the cultists with their undead zombies).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463190/#Comment_463190" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T14:56:58+00:00" title="May  9, 2017  2:56PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://tonydowler.com/projects/purple-worm-graveyard/" rel="nofollow">Purple Worm Graveyard</a> makes a good one-shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463191/#Comment_463191" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T15:41:07+00:00" title="May  9, 2017  3:41PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu, I strongly suggest to use "Magia &amp; Acciaio", just released.<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/?page_id=3497" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/?page_id=3497</a><br/>Together with one of the "one page dungeon" adventures already ported by me. <br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/?page_id=3501" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/?page_id=3501</a><br/>Ciao, <br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463192/#Comment_463192" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T16:32:56+00:00" title="May  9, 2017  4:32PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a solid plan!<br/><br/>I think that for OSR-style play, in most game systems character generation is really quick, with the possible exception of equipment selection. There are various alternatives you can use for that, like the following:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.necropraxis.com/2012/07/20/odd-equipment/" rel="nofollow">necropraxis.com/2012/07/20/odd-equipment/</a> (Scroll down to table)<br/><br/><a href="http://swordandscoundrel.blogspot.ca/2016/04/random-starting-equipment-for-bx-or.html" rel="nofollow">swordandscoundrel.blogspot.ca/2016/04/random-starting-equipment-for-bx-or.html</a><br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16088/osr-starting-equipment-packages" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/16088/osr-starting-equipment-packages</a><br/><br/><br/>The best one I've seen was simply a visual collection of equipment - you throw down these drawings of various useful items, and then let the adventurers fight over them. ("Who will carry the shield? Ok, but what about the rations?") Unfortunately, I can't find the link just now. (Anyone know?)<br/><br/>I would actually recommend making your own dungeon. It won't take long, you can make exactly what you want/need, and you'll have it "internalized" before bringing it to the table, since you put it together in the first place.<br/><br/>My take on an OSR game is that you don't need to worry about pacing and how long the session will take - that's up to the players, who "drive the bus" at the speed they like. Let them know that's the case and then simply roll with it - your job in this style of game is much less proactive than in other styles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463197/#Comment_463197" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T17:19:34+00:00" title="May  9, 2017  5:19PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2017 5:21PM by adamwb.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Start the players as prisoners of some foe, with maybe just one item, and make sure there is equipment scattered around the dungeon. Easy structure (get out alive, treasure and exploration is the b plot). I've in particular used this at events that aren't structured as cons\u2014where the game is one among many and people drop in and out. Very quick to start!<br/><br/>I personally find running just megadungeon expeditions great with con groups but it requires some different framing for sure\u2014making sure people don't play defensive is very important. In part I like it because it is so refreshing\u2014make them start at level one, and try to make sure that character creation produces some quick but notable or humorous results. Instead of moving carefully and slowly, the players should quickly recognize that trying to \u201ccomplete\u201d the dungeon is literally impossible, and instead the game should turn on some bold or even foolish plays made because stakes are so much lower than an on-going game, or even intra-party drama. Fun-house dungeon, not play-to-win dungeon. You have to work to make this the tone though.<br/><br/>You also have a stick: the session is three hours. If you are still in the dungeon when the clock strikes midnight, you save vs death in your last desperate escape attempt.<br/><br/>I always use my own dungeon\u2014but part of the promise there is also that it contains remnants of previous expeditions and the players if they make big plays become a part of its history too.

It wasn't hard to do: those were already on my mind after falling in love with the tasty &amp; tasteful implementation in <i>Nightmares Underneath</i>. So I'm either stealing liberally from any of the sources you've kindly provided, or cobbling together my own, also depending on the exact ruleset I end up picking.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm doing pre-gen characters, though. I'd rather have players roll 3d6 in order, pick a character type (systems currently under scrutiny only have about 3) and roll for an equipment package. Skipping equipment shopping should considerably speed up things. I'll be careful to avoid those rule systems involving a lot of derived stats and aim for 15-minute character creation.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If you're looking for OSR simplicity, I'd recommend Swords and Wizardy.</p></div></blockquote>\n<i>Swords and Wizardry</i> is cool, but I'm a bit worried about the "D&amp;D baggage" at a convention, where I can't control who I'm playing with.

They're coming in behind the players, and will always happen to arrive shortly after a major fight where PCs die. (Just enough time to roll up a new character, or to grab a previously made one from a stable/pregens.)<br/><br/>This is indeed a major violation of the "impartial referee" ethos of the form, but it's a necessary one (and one most players prefer, in my experience) to make sure that players are able to stay engaged in the action. This is especially true in a con setting (e.g. 3 hour slot), but is also common practice for home games. Otherwise you might lose over an hour as the party exits the dungeon, for all intents and purposes erasing or endangering much of their progress. <br/><br/>Real life time is precious--collectively break realism for a moment if necessary to get the players all back together and moving forward!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463224/#Comment_463224" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T08:49:19+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  8:49AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Stephen P" rel="nofollow">Stephen P</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Real life time is precious</p></div></blockquote>\nI hear you!<br/><br/>Does anybody have any experience with having everybody play 2 or more characters to begin with, so that "replacements" aren't actually needed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463225/#Comment_463225" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T08:52:14+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  8:52AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2017 8:52AM by rgrassi.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It looks like quality work, but it somehow doesn't give me the feel I'm aiming for at the moment.

Probably a <i>better</i> game overall, but definitely not one with an "old school" feel about it. I'm preparing this for a convention where the theme is "retro", and that's what I want to embrace in full.</dd>\n<dt>Aesthetics</dt>\n<dd>Visuals are important to getting everybody on the same page quickly, and getting on the same page quickly is key to successful convention play. Your choices of visual aesthetics for your game, from the illustrations you picked for the board to the character sheets arranged in circles with skill levels emanating from the character portrait, are all very cool, but tip me the wrong way. They remind me of D&amp;D 3, Pathfinder, D&amp;D 4, Fantasy Flight boardgames such as Descent, computer games from Baldur's Gate to Diablo to whatever the kids are playing online these days... That's going to trigger one side of what I've called "the D&amp;D baggage", especially for younger people, who've only been playing D&amp;D since after 2000.</dd></dl>\nElaborating on the above, the "D&amp;D baggage" is of course a huge, complex thing - older players have it too, in a variety of different forms, related to their childhood and teenage experiences with RPGs and nostalgia for those days. Things I'm vaguely worried about (and made me wary of, for example, B/X and S&amp;W, merely because of possible brand association with childhood memories) include everything from fantasy racial typecasting to hilarious fumbles, to HPs as "meat points", to fights to the death, and much more - but none of these is what I'm worried <i>Magia &amp; Acciaio</i> might lead to, of course...<br/>Rather, what I was trying to put my fingers on, when I mentioned "post-2000 D&amp;D aesthetics", is a feeling that the player characters are cool action heroes in shiny (or spiky) armor and goth black cloaks, with all that entails. That rule-of-cool applies, say, or that, as "main characters", they can occasionally get away with dumb stuff for the sake of plot.<br/>The player characters in the kind of dungeon delve I'm envisioning aren't heroes or cool - they're a bunch of desperate lowlifes entering a hole in the ground to look for treasure because they either don't have any better options or can't be bothered to work for a living. They're about as heroic or cool as a crew of pirates (see Vincent's <i>Poison'd</i>), with armor probably as shiny as post-apoc scrounge gear. But they aren't incompetent comedic reliefs, either - they're assumed to possess a mix of basic skills granting them a fair shot at getting out with the loot. Just how many lives lost a "fair" shot entails remains to be seen.<br/>To communicate that, I feel extremely lo-fi, vaguely punk, handwriting &amp; scratchy etchings visual aesthetics are required. No neat arrangement of skills in a circle around a handsome, clean-shaven character portrait.<br/><br/><i>Edited to add:</i> I hope I managed to get my point through, because it's really hard to put a finger on a feeling this vague, and I hope I didn't sound confrontational.

When a PC bites it, the player can just roll a new character who rises from the ranks of the redshirts with their new spirit of initiative, motivation and heroism (that is, PC-hood) to lead the rest to victory over the dead body of their erstwhile employer.<br/><br/>I feel that this is better than playing multiple characters in that it supports roleplaying, keeps the character perspective (what the character knows, as opposed to what the player knows) clearer and keeps the amount of information under robust control. Having multiple PCs per player does not actually give the game anything that having henchmen doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463233/#Comment_463233" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-10T15:24:37+00:00" title="May 10, 2017  3:24PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> <br/><br/>I usually start with In the Care of Bones<br/><a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/search?q=in+the+care+of+bones" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blog.trilemma.com/search?q=in+the+care+of+bones</a><br/>This places you in a vast grasslands.<br/><br/>As the grasslands grade into scrublands we have<br/>A Litany in Scratches<br/><a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/2014/12/a-litany-of-scratches.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blog.trilemma.com/2014/12/a-litany-of-scratches.html</a><br/><br/>On the other side of the ruins in Litany as you move out of the desert scrub into a mesa you wander across<br/>The Roots of Ambition<br/><a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/search?q=roots+of+ambition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blog.trilemma.com/search?q=roots+of+ambition</a><br/><br/>After Roots you drop down into a lush valley only faced with another massive wall from <br/>The Oracle's Decree (<a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/2015/10/the-oracles-decree.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blog.trilemma.com/2015/10/the-oracles-decree.html</a>).<br/><br/>In both Litany and Roots I dropped hints of the Call of the Light (<a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/search?q=call+of+the+light" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://blog.trilemma.com/search?q=call+of+the+light</a>).

Have them play one character each, but contrive for there to be some other people nearby/around. When a PC dies, they can roll up a new character and "become" one of those hereto unimportant NPCs.<br/><br/>Hirelings are great. They're important and useful, but remember that they're not "meat shields" - they're just here to make a buck. They're not going to bravely march into the maw of death for you. (How much are you paying them, again?)<br/><br/>This means that most of the adventuring still falls to the PCs. However, should they snuff it, they have backup roles they can take on.<br/><br/>In OSR-style D&amp;D games I've participated in, occasionally other ways to contrive having other characters available has been used. Some were pretty extreme! For instance, once, after a PC's death, the GM simply announced that the treasure chest we were searching had an unconscious person inside! We woke them up - they had little memory of how they got there, and the player of the dead PC created them as their new character.<br/><br/>This sounds incredibly contrived, but it can be a good source of humour at the table.

I can drop the dungeon in the middle of mostly uninhabited but non-dangerous land and have the PCs go there attracted by rumors alone. Additionally, none of the monsters in the adventure have obvious D&amp;D baggage attached - they're all original, and quite inventive, creations, allowing me to stat 'em up at whatever Monster Rating I need them to be.<br/><br/>My current plan is to state the PCs are part of a "company" of two dozen or so adventurous never-do-wells camped in the immediate area. The company has split to look for the dungeon entrance (they only know it's approximate location) and the first batch of PCs (plus any personal henchmen they might have) just happen to be the scouting party who've found it, thus earning "first entry" rights.<br/>I'll take care to warn the players I'm pulling no punches and casualties might be high. It's then entirely up to them whether to alert the larger company before trying the cliff face, and if so, how many extras to take into the dungeon as reinforcements. Ideally, a second wave of delvers will be waiting right at the entrance or following up just a couple rooms on the first wave's heels, justifying the introduction of additional replacement PCs as needed.<br/>The treasures to be found in the dungeon - if found - are gemstones of such huge size that their value can easily be handwaved to "just enough loot to keep everybody happy" anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463289/#Comment_463289" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-12T11:58:53+00:00" title="May 12, 2017 11:58AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you plan on handling XP, if that's a concept in T&amp;T? One one hand, I can see the point of ignoring it completely for a convention oneshot to save time both explaining how it works and recording it, but at least some old-school D&amp;D players see XP as an integral part of the experience. It's the score system to see how well you did, and if you know upfront what gives XP you can direct your efforts in that direction.<br/><br/>I ran a Whitehack game as a oneshot at a convention and prepared a list of what would give XP. The idea was that other groups could try the same dungeon later and try to beat the high score. I only recorded total XP, but someone suggested I could have divided it by the number of PCs used to penalize deaths. If you run the same game for multiple groups at the convention it could be fun to have an objective score to see how they compare. Or not, depending on your tastes.<br/><br/>I ran oneshot B/X D&amp;D game with level 1 PCs that was very deadly, as a filler for our regular Whitehack game. One thing I used that was very popular with the players to quickly give character to newly created PCs was <a href="http://bxblackrazor.blogspot.se/2010/08/bx-headgear-new-charts-to-gear-up-your.html" rel="nofollow">B/X Blackrazor's Headgear Table</a> (the link is halfway through the post). Each new character rolled to see what headgear they had, which would give some creative variance to the character. They weren't just another fighter, but had some personality from the start, surprising even the player. The headgear table uses B/X classes, but could easily be modified to support T&amp;T classes if there are any in that game, or just pick one class and have every character roll on that table row.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463298/#Comment_463298" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-12T22:42:18+00:00" title="May 12, 2017 10:42PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This sounds incredibly contrived, but it can be a good source of humour at the table.

I hope this doesn't get too distracting, because IMO immediately getting EPs in the thick of things should feel fun and I'd like to retain that.<br/>At the end of a dungeon expedition, you get additional EPs for "daring" (how deep you ventured into the dungeon) and for treasures found, including magical items (which the GM is supposed to rate for experience value - that's the most fiddly part, but for a 1-shot I don't have to worry much about giving too many or too few EPs).<br/><br/>Blackrazor's headgear table was already in my toolbox, but that kind of funny flavor details I'm probably going to integrate in the equipment packages I'm compiling - after <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> 's very fine suggestion - so that character creation is strictly rolling 3d6 seven times in order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463350/#Comment_463350" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-15T00:43:41+00:00" title="May 15, 2017 12:43AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For the record, of Prescott's dungeons I'm now leaning toward <i>The Full-Dark Stone</i>, as it looks about the right size, has an open-ended "plot" with an interesting NPC to interact with, ...</p></div></blockquote>\nKorm has become one of my campaign's favorite NPCs!
