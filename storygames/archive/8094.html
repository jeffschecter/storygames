If you played your last few games totally as the book described with no changes at all, post that as well!<br/><br/>4E: Currently, I'm in 2 4e campaigns (one bi-weekly, one monthly). We have the same houserule in both groups, even though the members and GMs are different: You can use an Action Point to Redo whatever you just did. In other words, rather than simply a free action, if you tried to do a Daily but failed, you can use an Action Point to try the Daily/Encounter again. <br/><br/>The bi-weekly 4e game is set in the X-Crawl setting (specifically Miami). We've added a "grandstanding skill" (which was originally in the 3x X-Crawl setting), based it on Charisma, and doing it after defeating an opponent or room raises your popularity with the crowd.<br/><br/>Before that, I ran an L5R campaign where I pretty much changed the wound track, added a fanmail mechanic, added a "last ditch attempt/but give the GM an opportunity to screw you over" mechanic, added a kind of "spiritual attribute" (from The Riddle of Steel).<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178349/#Comment_178349" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T11:40:17+00:00" title="November 12, 2008 11:40AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running PTA all kinds of wrong.

There's probably some drift happening, but it's not conscious.<br/><br/>Before that, I played in Eric's massively drifted D&amp;D3.5 game before I had to drop out for time constraints.  It's hard to remember all the ways we broke it.  Half the classes were ones Eric invented.  The other half were stolen from the internet.  I was a she-yak who was the incarnation of the Himalayan goddess of destruction.  My main weapon was a giant metal bell that I more or less dropped on people.  My "niche" was terrain manipulation, creating cover, tunneling, doing all kinds of earth-bending.  Other characters were similarly crazy.  Before each session, we rolled off to see who was the "narrator" of this portion of the story.  They got to add an extra d6 to every roll (assuming that you always look better in your own version of events) and also tell each other player how their character viewed the other characters, and the other players attempted to embody that stereotype for that potion of the game.  That was often hilarious.  Also, when we all died (which happened a lot, since Eric was running The Red Hand of Doom) we got to re-spawn before the battle occured and could completely change what we tried the first time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178383/#Comment_178383" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T13:53:27+00:00" title="November 12, 2008  1:53PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My last couple have been played unchanged.

No experience. We level after each climactic plot point - usually, but not always, once a session. No number tracking, no monster or encounter grinding and a very dynamic game.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. No random magic items. We each have a 'legacy item', a iconic magic item tied to the setting and the story. These items grow in power as we do. So, for example, I have the Hammer of the Earth Titan. At level 9 it adds +2 to hit, damage, AC and defences and +2d6 to criticals. It has one encounter power (an earthquake power that knocks people prone) and a daily (free action healing surge use). At level 11 I will get another daily. This sort of thing covers the recommended bases for magic items but stops the WoW-style upgrade syndrome.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Skill challenges have a very 'indie' feel with narration rights and alternate loss mechanisms. Its a bit complicated but, for example, if we want to move across a large desert we will do it as a skill challenge. If the players win a roll, we narrate how awesome we are. If we lose a roll, the GM describes how we fail and then charges us according to the encounter. So we might lose a healing surge, a daily power etc. Its very effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. We have wiggle in flavour for everything. So our Mage is a Sea Mage and just reflavours everything to his liking. Magic Missile is a screaming seagull.

This minor shift keeps the low-starting-skill characters from seeming like complete buffoons. The WFRP rule book kinda-sorta talks about this, but in a vague way.

A divine power-source class must have a divine patron (or faith) with which they are \u201cin favour\u201d.  If their behaviour falls away from what this patron favours, their powers weaken and they must either \u201cget back on track\u201d or \u201cfind an alternate patron\u201d.  It remains the case that there is no visible sign displayed in powers showing a change in patron.  See notes to Divine Character Classes.  This translates as well into a requirement that all Players create PC\u2019s that are compatible with the faith of a Cleric or Paladin PC (and these two are coordinated).<br/><br/>Play with Flavour - Players must be descriptive in narrating their actions in tactical fights or skill challenges.  "I cast magic missile" or "I use Diplomacy" is sucky and the target's defense is given a +2, DC is +2.  [This one is phased in, first few times using 4e rules going easy].  DM nudges.  Simply using the flavour text in a power is fine 1st time it's used in an encounter, from there get creative.<br/><br/>Aid Another\u2019s DC is not 10, it is 10 + \xbd the level of the challenge.  For example, using Aid Another to help defeat a trap that is level 6 or 7 is a DC 13.<br/><br/>Skill Challenge mods (mostly from Keith Baker):<br/>- a PC can spend an Action Point to reroll a failed skill check, representing \u201cthe extra distance\u201d;<br/>- if it is plausibly of assistance, you can use Powers in Skill Challenges, an applicable at-will gives a single +2 bonus, an encounter power gives a reroll of a failure and a daily power gives a single automatic success.<br/>- you can use a Ritual in a skill challenge, if it is plausibly helpful and the narration believable, to give a +2 bonus to up to three skill checks (simultaneously or consecutively) - the time constraints of Ritual casting remain in effect [meaning it's often not plausible as skill challenges are frequently for extended time actions]<br/><br/>A house rule (recommended by 4e Designer Jonathan Tweet):  you do not get the benefits of an extended rest until you have also reached 2 milestones.  A milestone is reached every 2nd normal encounter, thus you are expected to face at least four encounters before healing all damage and recovering use of daily powers by resting.<br/><br/>Not Quite a "rule change" but "change from expected", Coming Back From Dead not So Sure.  Playing in a military campaign and PC's wanted heroism to matter, risk of death is real risk.  Translated not as a rules change but a change in NPC attitudes/economies.  You can't buy raise dead, it's done for those "who merit it".  Have you impressed officers or "someone else"?<br/><br/>This connects to their being an ongoing Minor Quest of "heroism" (doing something brave the system's math really doesn't suggest is a good idea), voted on by the whole table.  If a PC dies being heroic, this may create a "unit tradition".  From then on, any PC spending action points in the course of attempting a similar heroic act (similar in purpose, not method) finds that all other PC\u2019s may act out of initiative and spend an Action Point to carry out any single action they choose be it an Aid Another or other action - as long as it supports the success of this act of heroism in \u201cunit tradition\u201d.<br/><br/>The starting tradition is the Standard Shall Not Fall.  A standard must be destroyed or recovered, and it is better to die defending the standard than to retreat from it.  Over the nineteen years of the Regiment\u2019s existence, ten soldiers have died for its standards.  Only two standards have ever been lost, both at the Battle of Seven Towers.  One of the PC's (a dwarven paladin) was an Ensign (standard bearer) before the PC's were formed into a special unitl (he destroyed a standard rather than see it fall).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178991/#Comment_178991" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T10:16:54+00:00" title="November 17, 2008 10:16AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Mutants and Masterminds</b><br/><br/>The GM never rolls dice.
