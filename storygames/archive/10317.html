Basically the incentive is to mash as much trash together as you can muster in an explosion of bright colours and low frame rate animation. How much weirdness can you produce using as many incongruous references as possible? Carebear_Voltron vs The Smurfinator?<br/><br/>As you can see I'm not really big on rule sets so I'm after any suggestions for engines or mechanics or anything really.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229501/#Comment_229501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T00:55:12+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:55AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have much insightful commentary (it's also very not my genre), but I'll offer a link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.zmangames.com/products/CAH/about.htm" rel="nofollow">Cartoon Action Hour</a> might (or might not) already do everything you need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229712/#Comment_229712" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T17:55:13+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  5:55PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, what do you want Play to reward? <br><br>If players are rewarded by the system by inventing weird mash-ups between cartoon characters, or bringing in an as-of-yet-unmentioned 80s pop culture icon,<br/>or describing the low-frame-rate aspect of the action (and the repeating backgrounds, simple colors, etc), then you have to make the system, because nothing exists yet to do that. <br/><br/>Alternately, you can modify my system: each player must bring a box of sugary cereal. the gm (that's you) brings a lot of milk. this is a game to play instead of eating dinner, FYI. <br/><br/>1. when any player introduces SOMETHING BESIDES one of the above three things into the game, any other player can pour cereal into that player's bowl. (um, everyone has a bowl, including the gm.) AS THEY POUR, they a) keep their eyes shut, and b) make their best laugh track impersonation.<br/><br/>2. When the gm decides that a player character is undergoing internal conflict, then the gm pours some milk onto the cereal in the bowl. That player then begins to monologue about the internal conflict that they've just been told they are in, and shovel cereal into their mouth at the same time. They continue to eat until their cereal is gone, at this point they can again be penalized for adding non-80s-cartoon-things to the fiction.<br/><br/>3. being quiet too long also receives some cereal. Cartoons are never quiet.<br/><br/><br/>/ so, obviously my system just punishes te players, so it's not ideal. But hey, good luck. &amp; tell me how those belly aches work out for your crew!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
