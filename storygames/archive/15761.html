I made some fairly broad characterizations of the game without providing sufficient context. So, that is what I am going to try to do here, as well as exploring how player behavior has developed and been shaped by the evolution of the game.<br/><br/>Here are some excerpt to get the gist of the situation:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I have no idea what 4e supposedly did that was so destructive to that ability, so I have no idea how to tell you to get it back. Did you eat a bunch of paint chips or something? I donno.</blockquote>\nIt wasn't so much destructive, so much as it withered due to lack of use. 4E is a very highly structured game, combats are played on a grid. Dungeon delves are played on a grid. And the power system created a set of player actions that were nearly always better than engaging the core system. Thus, there was a strong walled garden effect, and routines were established early.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>It doesn't really say much of anything about it, which is the issue. The tactical strategy elements of the game reward risk aversion.</blockquote>\nThis is exactly what I'm talking about.  4e promotes risk aversion to a drastically lesser degree than earlier editions of D&amp;D:<br/><br/>- the existence of healing surges and more broad-based healing abilities means risks are less catastrophic when an idea goes bad<br/>- the lack of save-or-die situations means risk aversion is reduced<br/>- the quicker refresh of encounter abilities means you're encouraged to try things out with magic spells (in earlier editions this was a bad idea due to risking having to wait a whole day to get that spell back)<br/><br/>What I am trying to get at is not the specific elements of the game, such as visuals / grids, risk aversion and what not as they are definitely present throughout other editions of the game. I am interested in how those elements have changed in the development of 4e.<br/><br/>So, while it is true the 4e provides an environment that is much safer for exploring by eliminating save or die situations, and generally being more forgiving of mistakes it incentives it in different ways. My suggestion is that the power system in 4e diminishes much of the exploration nature of the game because it becomes somewhat unnecessary. Powers represent pre-negotiated character game interactions. Powers generally provide exceptions to the underlying rules that are generally better than what would be negotiated with a DM in most situations based on my experience. Additionally, they act a sort of menu for activity within the game that boxes in the players mindset.<br/><br/>In previous editions a player may have been risk averse because they knew interacting with the environment could be lethal. In 4e players may be risk averse because they have an explicit structure to fall back on.<br/><br/>Thus, my suggestion is that while player motivations may remain fundamentally the same throughout the editions, the rules in previous edition encouraged creativity to support that behavior, while as 4e presents a set of boundaries to fall back on.<br/><br/>And that is my ramblely, redundant two cents. I may go back and clean that up later, but for now I just want to get the ball rolling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357582/#Comment_357582" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T11:11:36+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 11:11AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>Powers represent pre-negotiated character game interactions.

Factors might include: what's not written, how much text is dedicated to certain ideas, supporting examples, emergent behavior encouraged by the way sub systems interact, how much what's asked works with or against established habits from in or even outside the game, the modules that help teach the DM the rules, D&amp;D Encounters at retail stores, who's teaching the game, and much more. <br/><br/>Past editions of Call of Cthulhu didn't say, "roll spot/hidden even when what's there is obvious or even if the investigation will hit a dead end if they fail." Yet a lot of people (not everyone) seem to be doing exactly this. The editions I have don't say to do this. But they also don't say not to. But even more importantly, when I flip through my old published Call of Cthulhu modules, they include many things you have to roll Spot/Hidden for that if you fail, the investigation hits a dead end. And I don't know why, but most people I know who run CoC (which is a lot) didn't even read the rules text. I don't know why. Maybe it seemed so simple they didn't think they had to. Maybe because it was 300 pages. But many of them learned how to play from those modules. And many of those modules have these crappy habits baked into them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357592/#Comment_357592" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T11:37:06+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 11:37AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jenskot, that is an excellent point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357594/#Comment_357594" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T11:37:52+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 11:37AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>So, while it is true the 4e provides an environment that is much safer for exploring by eliminating save or die situations, and generally being more forgiving of mistakes it incentives it in different ways.

I think that (in my experience) players in a position of uncertainty will avert their eyes from the rest of the party (because people are looking at you all "what are you going to do!?" and if you don't know, it can be very intimidating) and look down at their sheet, searching for answers there.  It's a learned behaviour that, once you unlearn it, you can see the rules as triggered actions that kick in when they need to, rather than a shopping-list of stuff you can do.  Though, that's exactly what it is in 4e - a list of answers to "what do I do now" and so without it, you're not actually able to act.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357602/#Comment_357602" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T11:51:54+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 11:51AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>It does not say much of anything at all, which creates the murk that players avoid by choosing to stick with powers.

I'm not a DnD buff by any means, but I think powergaming through optimizing in 3.5 relies on a similar underlying structure - one that gives the appearance of rewarding them more for knowing the rules than for engaging with the GM's world. This is also the case in computer games (except Sleep is Death, which is really a computer story game) since the GM does not exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's probs important to remember that the functional effect of rules on a game isn't limited to their specific and explicit statement of rules - it's also the way they are typically interpreted and used by players. So whether or not 4e states things is separate to whether it has a good but to do with a game being played in a particular way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first time I ever ran a game (quote recently compared to most here, I suspect,) I ran one of the 4th edition pre-mades at the suggestion of another player in my group. I spent a lot of time writing down numbers and moving things on battle grids and describing outcomes as the players crashed through the structure laid out in the book. It drove me nuts that it didn't seem like I was doing anything and eventually I cracked. I improvised a mounted combat escape-from-dungeon-location section using rules I made up on the spot. Apparently it was their favourite part of the whole game. That's how I learned to stop caring, ignore rules that don't suit me and make stuff up. You could say that it's my fault for being a terrible DM. I'm certainly not the best person in the group when it comes to running games. The pre-made and the way it describes things could also be partly to blame. In my next game, we used a different system and it was still more engaging when the players went thousands of miles in the opposite direction of the one I intended them to go than when they did things according to plan in DnD4.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's also worth considering that different players and GMs are affected differently by each system of rules. Especially from their preconceptions, both about games and about the universe. So, in at least some cases, powers and DnD rules in general can go quite wrong. With people who know and like 4th, they aren't a problem. But that's a tautological statement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357607/#Comment_357607" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T12:08:21+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 12:08PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 3E + supplements is so full of options to play in multiple styles that I find it very hard to generalize what playing is like.

It's a learned behaviour that, once you unlearn it, you can see the rules as triggered actions that kick in when they need to, rather than a shopping-list of stuff you can do.  Though, that's exactly what it is in 4e - a list of answers to "what do I do now" and so without it, you're not actually able to act.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: todd</cite><cite>Posted By: jjafuller</cite>I have run into that issue so much with Dungeon World that I don't hand out the moves sheets to players any more.</blockquote>\nWait, what?

I think we stopped doing that because we were looking for a way to speed up combats in 4e. And, the fiction was one of the first things to go.

I've since reversed my position on the game, though, and I think that the people saying it gets in the way of role-playing are onto something. Just to define terms, by "role-playing," I'm talking about character development outside growing your powers, even though that's all technically part of role-playing. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that you can't role-play. Of course you can. But you can play Monopoly or RISK and role-play, too. You just don't, for a variety of reasons, including table expectations. But one of the reasons is that you're being rewarded for all this other stuff that has nothing to do with role-playing.<br/><br/>4E is the same way. You are rewarded for killing stuff and overcoming traps and hazards, and occasionally for beating skill challenges. Maybe your DM gives you XP for role-playing. Great! You spend that XP to level up and get new powers. These powers don't have a lot to do with role-playing as I defined it. So you start play at the new level with all these new powers, and you really want to try them out. So you do. And a lot of your focus and concentration is on the fighty stuff, because that's what the new powers make you better at. And with each level advanced, you get new distractions and new incentives to fight, fight, fight, and few incentives to role-play.<br/><br/>Add to all of that the disconnection between fiction and powers, as described above, and the game can start to feel more like a wargame than a role-playing game. Or at least, when you're role-playing, it has nothing to do with the system. <br/><br/>It's like saying you like driving in your car with friends because you enjoy all the talking. But your engine is really loud and the drive is necessarily fast and race-car-like and everyone is hanging onto their seats and can't hear each other. So you have to stop the car and get out to talk to each other. Is the car great for talking? Not really. Does it stop you from talking? Not when you get out of the car, no, but you want to talk while driving. That was the whole point. Not to race it really fast.<br/><br/>That's my feeling, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357629/#Comment_357629" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T13:33:36+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  1:33PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>ran into the Move list thing with one group for AW.

I was not pulling it off as well at Paragon level and both the 4E group I was DM'ing for and the 4E group I was playing in fell apart (for me) mid-to-early Paragon; I haven't played 4E for more than a year.<br/><br/>I agree with those that have the perception that several elements of 4E make it harder to find space for "role-playing," and/or "exploration."  I only ran 4E RAW a few times and quickly added two hacks - my own version of Stalker0's Skill Challenge system and a formula for increased PC and monster damage to help mitigate some of these elements.  I later added an "Iron Heroes-esque" third hack to encourage improvised PC stunts far more than what I saw as p42's inadequate attempt to do so.<br/><br/>I definitely soured on 4E a bit over its lifespan.  I really forgave a lot of its sins early on because there is a lot of gold in there and I feel confident in my abilities to improve games by hacking them.<br/><br/>I am a little curious to see what WotC will do with the game but not so curious that I'm really following what's going on with "D&amp;D next" so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357737/#Comment_357737" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T06:48:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  6:48AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2012 6:49AM by JDCorley.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Adam says is indeed true about 4e, but it is also true about all prior editions of D&amp;D - "level", in D&amp;D, is (almost) entirely about combat capability.

Check out the advancement table on p.29 of the 4e Player's Guide.  <br/><br/>Between level 1 and 30 there are 29 levelups.<br/><br/>For 7 of them you replace an existing power with a different power (net gain in character complexity: 0)<br/>For 9 of them, you either gain 1 power or gain 1 feat. (net gain: 1)<br/>For 10 of them you gain 1 power + 1 feat, or a path feature + 1 feat (net gain: 2)<br/>For 2 of them you gain path feature(s), a power and a feat (could be multiple things here)<br/><br/>(Looks like I missed 1 somewhere, whoops!)<br/><br/>Anyway, compare this to playing, say, a cleric in 3e, where every <i>adventuring day</i> you have to choose what to put in spell slots from a list of hundreds of possible spells; thousands if you use the add-ons.<br/><br/>Virtually always in 4e you only ever gain 1-2 things per level - and this is true for all characters, not just fighters.<br/><br/>Edit: I'm not arguing with your perception. People perceive 4e to be a WOW babby's game, with no roleplay like we had in D&amp;D in the OLDEN DAYZ, it's "D&amp;D on easy mode", etc. Players often come to 4e games with these expectations and it affects their play.  This in turn affects the perceptions of others at the table.  I've had someone look right at the page that says "Random Encounters" in 4e and tell me 4e didn't have any random encounters, (and thus 4e "ruined his immersion.")  Like, I was literally showing him the page - he chose to believe what he heard about 4e rather than his lying eyes.

I look forward to buying all the books used when 5E comes out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357763/#Comment_357763" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T10:51:40+00:00" title="February  4, 2012 10:51AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2012 10:55AM by nemomeme.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played and ran a LOT of 4E  but played at least three times more 3.X (rarely ran it), and was usually the caster<br/><br/>With some variation I would play the same dozen or so spells across multiple campaigns and characters.  My daily spell selection for a given character was usually the same playlist of spells I knew well with one or two swap out options at the bottom of the list.  Further, a lot of the spells were of the fire-and-forget or buff-and-forget variety, providing a constant bonus that the recipient would just record on their sheet and consider as part of their static state going into any given combat. "Redgar always gets the Bull Strength, just before breakfast and in the early afternoon."<br/><br/>I chose to take on this amount of complexity because few of the others in our groups liked it or had much aptitude with it.  4E requires <i>every</i> player to be a "caster" and, as their levels increase, to make a staggering number of tactical decisions from turn to turn.  It works pretty well for the first few levels, but the number of options and the interactions associated with all the interrupts reaches a critical mass, and crowds out certain kinds of gameplay.  To play optimally you have to know not only all of your powers well, <i>but what every other member of your X-team is capable of and in what order, along with all the status effects (buffs &amp; de-buffs) in play, effects that are changing constantly between each of your actions.</i><br/><br/>I like 3E and 4E enough to give both of them a "B" if that's what I'm in the mood for, but I found them hugely different experiences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357807/#Comment_357807" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T18:52:21+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  6:52PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>That's a good point.

And don't forget that playing anything other than a caster at high levels is fairly pointless in RAW 3e. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
