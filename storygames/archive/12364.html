At this stage in the game's lifecycle the loot is largely worthless, the tokens are of higher value, since they allow access to the highest tier of raid content in the game. Each 5-man group requires a tank, a healer and 3 DPS (damage per second) players.<br/><br/>A little while back, Blizzard introduced the cross-realm Dungeon Finder. A realm is an instance of the game world, and there is no in-game interaction between players in different realms: they're parallel universes. By drawing from multiple realms, the tool expands the pool of players available for a group many times, and automates group formation, making it far easier and quicker to put such parties together. Blizzard further incentivized group formation by giving extra rewards for the successful completion of a random dungeon: some cash and more tokens.<br/><br/>So, <em>fundamental</em> because any player that wants to participate in the most recent content that the game has to offer will be farming said tokens to get the gear that allows them to set foot in end-game raids and not fall over dead. Putting five strangers together at random is inherently social, even if the dungeon is run with no chat at all. If the tank sucks, the healer's fail, or the DPS are terrible, other players can tell (the details aren't that important, and are somewhat debatable... just trust me here).<br/><br/>Blizzard launched the tool with a feature called <em>"Vote Kick"</em> which allows any player to start a vote on any other player in the party, and if two other players agree to kick them, buh-bye person-three-or-more-people-don't-like. With this in mind, many players with bad gear, but some competence will choose to say something at the start of the run; it makes it less likely that you'll get kicked, if you initiate human interaction*.<br/><br/>The degree of interaction can be highly variable, but at some point, people are making choices between things like <em>"kick the terrible tank with rotten gear"</em> and <em>"help out the noob tank, because more tanks is a good thing and s/he seems like a decent sort."</em> In other words, as you would expect, real life behaviour in the virtual world modifies real life responses from group members; it's a social game.<br/><br/><b>So what's the little big deal?</b><br/><br/>Today's patch introduces the following change:\n<blockquote>The functionality of the Vote Kick feature in the Dungeon Finder will now behave differently according to a player's history with the system. Players using the Dungeon Finder who rarely vote to kick players from a group, or rarely abandon groups before a dungeon is complete, will find that the Vote Kick option will have no cooldown. For players who frequently abandon groups or vote to kick other players, the Vote Kick option will be kept on a cooldown. This functionality will adjust itself as a player's behavior while using the Dungeon Finder changes.</blockquote>\nIn other words, Blizzard have introduced an explicit adaptive mechanism to mold social behaviour in the game. This trial behaviour is pretty clear-cut: the data analysis is relatively simple, and it's fairly easy for them to define "good" and "bad" behaviours, or at least behaviour that they want to reward, and behaviour that merits penalties. They've started out by applying the adaptive mechanism to a metagame feature: the Dungeon Finder tool has no place in the (tenuous) reality of the game's fictional world.<br/><br/>The big deal is the implementation a mechanic that uses statistical analysis of player behaviour to effect changes to a plastic world response. Making the game change depending on how the players play the game.<br/><br/>An example of where this might (should? must?) lead: WoW realms are classified as either PvP or PvE. In PvE worlds, outside of specific locations, it is impossible to harm another player. In PvP realms, the converse is true. This is a binary flag on the realm: either the default mode of player interaction is hostile, or the default is immunity to harm. There's no granularity at all. In practice this turns out to mean that some game zones on PvP realms are hotbeds of slaughter, and others are relatively safe for low-level players, but there's no enforcement. Imagine instead a realm where the PvP-ness of a location is defined by the play that happens <em>at that location</em>, and continues to adapt over time. Regions where ganking a low-level player incurs a rapid high-level response become regions where the game itself protects low-level players; or locations that are popular ambush spots develop into long-running free-for-all combat zones. (For another MMOG example, suppose that the security value of EVE:Online's star systems changed algorithmically depending on the amount of actual PvP activity there.)<br/><br/>More pie-sky-in example: organizing and running 25-man raids has been touted as a strong indicator of management skills. Can adaptive mechanics be used to incentivize players to learn positive real-world skills and behaviours?<br/><br/>It's a short hop from metagame mechanic to in-game mechanic, but it will be a fun one.<br/><br/><br/><br/><em>* This is largely surmise, based on anecdotal evidence. Blizzard/Activision will have the numbers, though, and I would bet a testicle that it's true: for the same reason that you tell a kidnapper / hostage-taker your name. Monkey brain identifies with human words better than orc shaman action.</em> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277401/#Comment_277401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T17:26:25+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  5:26PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blizzard already announced that in Cataclysm the world will adapt to PvP activity and results.<br/>They will adapt the "phase" technology to "contested" areas, so that strategic spots in the map will be Alliance controlled or Horde controlled, according to the PvP result and thus the behaviour of NPC and other stuff will change.<br/>It will be an escalation of what happens to Wintergrasp, to the Towers in Hellfire, the scout vendors and the ruined temple in Zangarmarsh and to the Towers in the Easter Plaguelands.<br/>The world will be adaptive even to quest-line advancement, just as it is in Icecrown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277671/#Comment_277671" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T09:30:24+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  9:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Phasing is conceptually an extension of the paradigm that your toon is significant to the story because <em>you</em> are doing all the quests. It's still pretty silly because <em>everyone else</em> is identically significant, in parallel, and you can be identically significant many times over (6 or 7 in my case, to my shame). Applying phasing to PvP results may engender changes to strategic or tactical play, but not the social interactions of play, which is the interesting change here.<br/><br/>If you like, Blizzard have :<br/>\u2022 noticed that some people are dicks in random groups,<br/>\u2022 decided that dicks inhibit newer players from enjoying the endgame,<br/>\u2022 defined an emergent property they want to see (less dick behaviour),<br/>\u2022 iterated the Vote Kick design until they get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
