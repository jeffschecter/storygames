Or at least "can take more hits".<br/><br/>In breaking that assumption in design today, I decided to play with the idea that bulk means adventurers simply need to figure out what means or capability will let them wound such a creature.  How to get past the dragon scales, or the dinosaur hide, or whatever; the creature might actually take the same "number of blows" to go down as most things once it's been smacked a good one.<br/><br/>And that led me to this idea about problem solving in a fantasy sandbox; adventurers acquiring the means to do the things they want.  Because I was thinking "if I put a dragon to guard the treasure, I should include in the notes what's needed to get past its scales." and then my next thought was "do I really?"<br/><br/>I mean, is there anything wrong with throwing a bunch of scary crap in the dungeon and letting the players try to figure it out for you?

So for example the lycanthropes handbook has a number of different kinds of lycanthropes, but also goes into things like giving some of your were creatures unique weaknesses (i.e. a werewolf that is not hurt by silver but some other substance specific to its personal history). The books basically give you tools to customize your monsters.<br/><br/>This idea of tying the monster's weakness to its past plays out in many of the books, which in my experience was an excellent premise for adventures. So if you have the party trying to deal with a flesh golem menacing a small town, they might find it nearly impossible to kill unless they do some investigating into its background or into local legends about it. This works well for ghost adventures, vampire adventures, mummy adventures (The Guide to Ancient Dead is particularly good), liches, etc.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442147/#Comment_442147" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T23:37:56+00:00" title="January 27, 2015 11:37PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2015 11:40PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I mean, is there anything wrong with throwing a bunch of scary crap in the dungeon and letting the players try to figure it out for you?</blockquote>Depends on how you as GM interact with such attempts.

Another option is to devise the solution, have some idea of how they might discover the solution, but also just be open minded. My rule of thumb in any investigation is if the PC pursue a course of action that would plausibly yield a particular clue, let them have it. This comes up all the time when I run police procedural stuff because even though I may know what evidence is out there and the details of the crime, players have so many resources to draw on and can triangulate clues in ways you hadn't imagined before play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442153/#Comment_442153" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T00:35:59+00:00" title="January 28, 2015 12:35AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>This idea of tying the monster's weakness to its past plays out in many of the books, which in my experience was an excellent premise for adventures.</blockquote>\nI dig this a lot.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442155/#Comment_442155" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T00:40:37+00:00" title="January 28, 2015 12:40AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>This idea of tying the monster's weakness to its past plays out in many of the books, which in my experience was an excellent premise for adventures.</blockquote>\nI dig this a lot.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI definitely recommend the original ones from the TSR era. Highly recommend guides to ancient dead, flesh golems, lycanthropes and lich. The guide to vampires was the first one and very good (it sets the tone for the rest of the series) but it doesn't commit to the first person conceit in the same way as the later ones--so sometime you get the oddness of van tighten mentioning game mechanics.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442156/#Comment_442156" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T00:40:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2015 12:40AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.

The only lurking issue lies in protecting players from arbitrary loss to what proves to be an unsolvable challenge, and that won't be a problem as long as they can opt out of the adventure when they conclude that it is unsolvable. Alternatively, making the unsolvable adventure a procedurally random event also helps, as then it's the luck of the dice rather than the GM determining your fate.<br/><br/>For a concrete example, let's assume that encountering a vampire at night proves an impossible challenge for a given party in a given campaign setting with a given sort of vampire in it. My stance is that putting that vampire into a dungeon the adventurers are not forced to explore is fine, and putting the vampire in the random encounter table is fine. However, it is not fine to just decide to force the vampire encounter on the party; at that point you've essentially taken the responsibility for the game being fun on yourself, which is a pretty shitty position to be in if it proves that the vampire cannot be beaten. That's where the worry about encounter challenge ratings comes from, a GM considering themselves responsible for the outcomes of encounters. Don't put yourself into that position of being responsible for an encounter, and you don't need to care about whether it is winnable or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442162/#Comment_442162" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T01:48:48+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  1:48AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks like Sword &amp; Sorcery picked up the Van Richten series and did some.

So what I'm talking about here is a design where when the GM wants to prepare a monster, the sum of her preparation is to name the monster and write about it in plain language, along with some bullet point facts.  There would be no "stats" per se because the rules explain what to do with facts, and the GM is aware of her remaining assumptions about her creations.  Example:<br/><br/>Dragon<br/>The dragon is very old, gigantic and a decrepit green color, covered in slimy patches.  It has one horn on its head. It's about the size of the longhouse in the village the adventurers come from.  It is paranoid about its treasure, and will only speak with intruders long enough to eat them or scare them away. Nobody remembers when it moved into the cave; to the people nearby it's always lived here.  Anyone examining it will notice the blood red veins in its wings.  Someone with nature or animal lore will realize it means the wings are possibly not in good enough shape for flying.<br/>* Can eat people in a single bite<br/>* Can grab with talons<br/>* Can't fly anymore (will not share this secret with others)<br/>* Can fill a quarter of the cave with poison gas which causes a retching and writhing sickness that ends about a minute after leaving the gas<br/>* Has a single layer of scales that are impervious to swords, axes and arrows                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442173/#Comment_442173" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T03:12:42+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  3:12AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, this is the direction my own D&amp;D development has been going for several years; if the specific mechanical procedures of the game <i>cannot</i> engineer the relevant statistics out of the particulars of the fiction, then there's a problem with the mechanics.

I often do this by using a 24 style timeline of escalating events. This is something I started in my counter terrorism investigations but it proved useful in fantasy investigations and mysteries as well. Basically make sure there is a fun night of gaming even if the players don't find any of the clues because there is enough crazy stuff going on around the mystery itself (for instance, even if they are totally bumbling solving a mystery or failing to find the weakness to the monster in your monster hunt scenario, just by involving themselves in it, they attract the attention of someone else involved who wants to thwart their efforts). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442191/#Comment_442191" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T14:27:23+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  2:27PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree that you should not come up with a solution.

While part of that is attitude, part of that is also not actually having any idea what shape the solution might take.  Designing a sort of "sample" solution to a problem can help avoid this, and also means that if the players "punt" and go "Okay, we want to go to talk to the ancient sage who knows all about this " then you have some details to give them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442193/#Comment_442193" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T14:50:43+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  2:50PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great point, <a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a>.<br/><br/>As an aside, one thing I've noticed sometimes is that some sessions go exactly the way I would have guessed, even if I'm not putting my thumb on the scales as far as outcomes go.

In the past I've generally held to Airk's school of thought, that the GM should always have at least one solution in mind. But maybe that's because I've never really run something as a sandbox.  When you talk about fun and elegant failure modes, do you just mean that there should always be an option to retreat ("Good job we all put so many points into the Fleeing skill!") and/or that the consequences of failure are mild ("Well, the Space Police beat us in that shootout using their stun-blasters. Looks like we're going to have to escape from Space Jail for the fifth time this week")? Or do you mean something more? And is this something that can/should be encoded in rules, or just in setting/premise ("NPC blasters are always set to stun")?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442202/#Comment_442202" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T18:24:40+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  6:24PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2015 6:25PM by Airk.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah; I actually find that the modern sort of "soft fail"/"fail forward"/"keep failure interesting" solutions work best in a non-sandbox setting.

The GM's role is to breath life into the setting, create a sense that they are somewhere real and that their choices matter. I also think of investigations as contained sandboxes. <br/><br/>I too find stuff like fail forward doesn't really jive with how I like to run or experience sandboxes. To me, while I know lots of people who enjoy fail forward, it suggests a storyline progression or an inability to truly fail, which for my taste is important. I don't want to play India Jones or feel like I am literally a character in The Temple of Doom or Raiders of the Lost Arc who is destined to get the treasure and the girl. Rather I want to feel like I am a character in a living breathing setting whose destiny is something of a blank canvass. <br/><br/>That said, I think keeping the game interesting (not failure itself) is totally compatible with sandbox play. All that means is you have active NPCs, groups, other things in the mix that keep the game enjoyable.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442209/#Comment_442209" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T20:39:20+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  8:39PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sortof going to disagree with your assertion that fail-forward implies a story, but the methods that don't imply a story tend to screw with the simulationism (yes, I'm sticking to this) of a "sandbox";  Namely, in a proper sandbox, if you are picking the lock to a door, you can work on it for some amount of time before the guard patrol comes by, and the GM has figured that out because it's part of your sandbox.

My sense is the purpose of fail forward is to maintain the flow of the story. Whereas a standard fail, doesn't think in those terms. It isn't necessary for it to feel like you are the star in a movie. Maybe I misunderstand what people mean by story or fail forward though. I think the key thing is though that fail forward, while it may work in many kinds of games, would present an issue for me in a sandbox because like you say my failed attempt is triggering an event and causing it to occur.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442214/#Comment_442214" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T20:58:20+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  8:58PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key element of fail forward, REALLY, is that it means that whenever you do something, SOMETHING HAPPENS.

No matter how far up or down you go, you keep running into the same one door leading to the same one room."<br/></blockquote>\n"No matter [where] you go" is not a puzzle, but a fixed outcome. What is the actual puzzle behind this outcome?<br/><br/>Also, how certain are you that the GM had not thought of ANY possible solutions?<br/><br/>I'm not at all convinced that the GM thinking up a solution in advance helps resolve this kind of situation.<br/><br/>In practice, I see this kind of thing happen:<br/><br/>Option 1 <br/><br/>GM presents an "impossible" challenge. Players attempt, and fail, to resolve it.<br/><br/>GM has a "solution" already in mind. Therefore, play continues. as the GM waits for the players to "figure it out".<br/><br/>(A more enlightened GM might simply feed the players information until the solve the scenario, but that, while better, is still ultimately unsatisfying for everyone involved.)<br/><br/>Option 2<br/><br/>GM presents an "impossible" challenge. Players attempt, and fail, to resolve it.<br/><br/>GM also cannot think of any possible solution. Therefore, once the players run out of ideas, the group quite naturally has a discussion: "Huh, it looks like there's no way to solve this. OK, guys, how do we want to handle this? Should we just rewind? Or accept that these characters are lost, and start with new characters?"<br/><br/>It's been my experience that, in the first case, aimless play is likely to continue, with both parties growing increasingly frustrated. In the second case, a conversation is much more likely to come up sooner (because no one seated at the table is simply sitting there, waiting for the "right" mode of action to be chosen by someone else). <br/><br/>Eero hits the nail on the head, in any case:<br/><br/>Your group needs to decide a couple of things before you play. These are make-or-break kinds of questions for the success of your game:<br/><br/>1. Is real, complete failure a possibility? Or does the characters' failure (which may include death, depending on the genre in question) also mean that the *game* has failed, because it can't move forward?<br/><br/>In an OSR-style sandbox (which I think Eero is referring to), the possibility of failure and death is very deliberately on the table: it is the very thing which is at stake in play. If failure is not a possibility, then everyone must conspire to play (and possibly bend the rules) so as to make sure it never happens.<br/><br/>However, if real failure is on the table, then no one is served by attempting to avoid it.<br/><br/>So, you must decide whether failure is a possible game-state or not. Important.<br/><br/>2. Setting clear expectations and communication: how do we communicate this stuff to each other?<br/><br/>In this kind of game, I would like to know, as a player, how the GM will handle potential game-ending traps of this sort. Is something like a completely inescapable staircase trap possible in this game? If so, is it up to me to try to make sure I never step into one, or will the GM make efforts to signal this kind of thing?<br/><br/>The construction of the fictional challenges involved is important here. After all, who decided to put this kind of trap into the game? What purpose does it serve?<br/><br/>Is it acceptable to have deathtraps with absolutely no warning? (In such games, the players should know that this can happen and accept that they will occasionally lose characters through no fault of their own. This is a fun mode of play: e.g. the Tomb of Terrors, and similar D&amp;D material.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, if we want player skill to always have some bearing on what's going on, I would expect (or advise) the GM to signal clearly that there is a deadly trap. If such a thing exists, it will impact its surroundings. Perhaps a trail of skeletons, or the smell of rotting flesh. Other people have presumably fallen trap to it before. Maybe they're on the staircase, shouting, "No! Don't come in here!"<br/><br/>Maybe there are stories about people who have gone to this location and never come back. Those stories would then be part of the landscape of play, and the players would know, if they fell trap to such a thing, that they had been warned beforehand.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the second part: now that we know why these things exist <i>in our game at all</i>, what <i>in-fiction rationale</i> is there for this kind of deathtrap? No one creates an extremely intricate "staircase of eternal doom" in the middle of nowhere. And if it did exist, again, people would know something about it (or it would be full of deer running away from larger predators, or some such thing).<br/><br/>In a "possible instant, random death" kind of scenario, such rationale is not necessary, of  course, but even then there is usually some logic behind where it can take place. If I'm playing Tomb of Terrors, I know that I can die simply by stepping through a doorway. But I also know it will only happen if I enter the dungeon in the first place. Dying instantly while walking from the inn's kitchen to the dining room wouldn't be fair play.<br/><br/>This gives the game some clarity: "go in there, and you accept that you might die at any moment". We're all on the same page about it. Playing "Tomb of Terrors" I'd be disappointed if I never encountered any deathtraps at all, it being such an iconic feature of the genre.<br/><br/>All these things must be clear for a functional game, I feel.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442218/#Comment_442218" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T21:04:59+00:00" title="January 28, 2015  9:04PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The key element of fail forward, REALLY, is that it means that whenever you do something, SOMETHING HAPPENS.

The "accept anything good enough"  quote in my first comment was a verbatim quote, as near as I can remember it.  After we gave up on that game, we literally asked him "What were we SUPPOSED to do?" and the answer was "I don't know, I just figured when you came up with something good enough, I'd run with it." or something not too far different.   This wasn't even INTENDED as a "deathtrap" or anything like it.  Additionally, if it had been, it would have been contrary to the expectations set for the campaign.  This was not a failure of negotiation.  This was, in fact, a clear cut failure to have any idea how we were supposed to deal with the puzzle.  Don't look at me as to what it was DOING there though.  This guy was not long on those sorts of explanations.<br/><br/>If this is to be a thread about the pros and cons of having solutions for things, I think this situation should be viewed as a reason why things should have solutions, and not as part of some larger social problem with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442228/#Comment_442228" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-28T22:55:35+00:00" title="January 28, 2015 10:55PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, interesting.<br/><br/>A bunch of people are sitting around a table for "most of a session", and not a single person has any idea of what can be done to solve the puzzle or otherwise move play along. Everyone is frustrated (or at least definitely not having fun). "Most of a session" sounds like this could be lasting for, potentially, many hours.<br/><br/>And there's no "social problem"?<br/><br/>Why doesn't someone (most likely the GM, in this case) speak up and say, "Hey, this isn't fun. Let's [do something else/come up with an out-of-game solution]?"<br/><br/>I've seen this in play, too. While it's partially a design issue (if you don't want the game to stall, don't include potential dead ends, or decide how you will handle it when you meet one), it's ultimately the people at the table who are causing this (by putting the puzzle there in the first place, by allowing others to engage it with no warning, by refusing to talk about it or figure out an out-of-game, by refusing to acknowledge that something in the game isn't fun, etc).<br/><br/>I don't find "GM, make sure you think of *some* solution first" as helping with any of these problems. (In my experience, of course.) <br/><br/>It just shifts the problem from "we can't find a solution" to "we can't guess the one, single, right solution", which feels identical, as a player. <br/><br/>Your GM came up with a puzzle that was unsolvable (after all, he couldn't even think of any potential approaches, never mind a functional solution, and he most likely new the capabilities of the characters involved), the group was unwilling to accept failure as a means to move the game along, and no one felt it was important to deal with the situation in any way except grumbling about it. You still don't know, to this day, what the puzzle even *was*. That goes well beyond "poor game design".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442241/#Comment_442241" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T04:27:22+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  4:27AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've interestingly encountered this puzzle paralysis phenomenon in investigative railroad gaming (Call of Cthulhu, to be precise), but never in a sandbox. I believe this to be the case because of the way a sandbox GM takes responsibility for the setting conceits: they know who built this endless starcase, they know what manner of themes and cosmological constants are behind its magical (?) operation. They have a failure-mode at the ready, which in this case means encouraging the group to give up and starve to death so the game can continue with new characters doing something else.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, that infinite staircase is, to me, a completely everyday occurrence for a challengeful sandbox game. That's the sort of shit you encounter with crazy wizards and capricious gods. Knowing that there is a solution in advance would do nothing for the way we put sandboxes together around here. As Paul says, the only questionable things I see in this scenario are that I'm not certain the GM knew enough about the underpinnings of their trap to judge solutions appropriately, and the group clearly didn't know how to execute a failure mode - give up, describe a blood-curdling end as the water runs out for the desperate adventurers, scribe a final warning message on a wall, and die.<br/><br/>(Incidentally: if I were a crazy wizard building an infinite staircase, I wouldn't include a "solution" either. Chances are that you're simply just fucked if you fall into something like that, intended to hold you. On the other hand, if it's an incidental property of a multi-dimensional mansion or whatever, perhaps there is hope yet. The GM's gotta know these things to be able to judge what might work and what might not.)<br/><br/>As for "failure modes", let's consider that for a bit. I've been using that term to describe what happens in an adventure game when the adventurers lose. The failure mode of the game begins to initialize when things start going awry, and it properly starts when the players acknowledge defeat. The failure mode consists of the way the players construe their feelings for defeat, what they do as a follow-up in terms of the play process, and how the game goes forward after the failure, if it does. As part of my personal conviction that there is something rotten in rpg land, I happen to think that many traditional games have awful, horribly dysfunctional failure modes, and that contributes hugely to the double-think behind GM cheating and railroading and all that stuff.<br/><br/>So, the basic question with failure modes for me is, what does a good failure mode look like? The kind of failure mode that enables the group of adventure rpg players to actually have failures in their game, instead of shying away and having the GM overtly or covertly cheat out of trouble. There are different strategies, but here's what the failure mode looks like in my more-or-less by the book old school D&amp;D homebrew:<br/><br/><b>*</b> Character generation is fast (as in, it takes a couple of minutes), and a high rate of fatalities is acknowledged from the first overtly with an amused attitude of "morituri te salutant" and all that. Character stables, character retirement, episodic play and all the other adaptive measures that support high rate of fatality are in full effect.<br/><b>*</b> The same objective rules apply to NPCs and PCs, and there is an universal saving throw mechanic for that little bit of extra uncertainty in the face of certain death. Judgements are fast, precise and lethal: fail that save, and in the lava pool you go. Everybody knows the rules, everybody applies the rules, the GM has no shadows in which to prevaricate. You know when you are supposed to die.<br/><b>*</b> The question in ambiguously dangerous situations is quite explicitly whether win or loss is to be had, not "how you win". This means that play is goal-oriented, and ambiguity is reduced to resolution processes. Everybody is engaged by the challenge, the possibility of victory or defeat.<br/><b>*</b> If a character is rendered un-adventurable by e.g. a case of early death, the group commiserates with the player, they smile and laugh bravely to prove their valiance, and generate a new character to join back in the fray. New characters are introduced without fuzz or muss, as the party has a lively revolving door anyway due to the changing player line-ups from session to session, and the high mortality rate. You'll soon be in play with a new character.<br/><b>*</b> The few successful adventurers inspire the group, who know that success in this endeavour of heroes and fools is indeed possible for the lucky and the brave. Such characters may retire from play specifically to enjoy their fictional largesse, and to avoid a horrible death in the next adventure.<br/><b>*</b> Should the entire adventure fail instead of mere few fatalities on the way, the party acknowledges this and the GM crows about in mock satisfaction at their failure. Then he offers new adventure hooks, and integrates the failure and its consequences in the sandbox setting, creating more depth and detail from failures as well as successes.<br/><b>*</b> Should the entire party die to some total fuck-up, everybody laughs uproariously and goes into an immediate post-emergency analysis of what, exactly, went so very wrong. The campaign might end at this point if we are satisfied with our exploration of this milieu and there aren't any on-going plots or operative characters left, but more likely we just start again with new characters, possibly tackling the same adventure that killed the last batch.<br/><br/>As can be seen, the failure mode in our homebrew D&amp;D consists of a quick character generation cycle, acknowledgement of the possibility of defeat at all levels, a certain attitude of machismo, and the idea that the best way to get over defeat is to get back in the saddle and try again. I'd like to specifically highlight that the <i>expectation of defeat</i> combined with the goal-oriented play causes the entire group to move head-first towards the imminent resolutions of situations instead of shying away and fiddling about, trying to postpone the inevitable. The morbid tone itself helps prepare players psychologically, and derive joy from both success and failure. For this type of game psychology the idea of cheating death is loathsome, as it casts a stain on the honor of every achievement ever made in the game - you have to valiantly take the blows of defeat for success to truly mean anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442242/#Comment_442242" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T04:27:49+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  4:27AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For contrast's sake, I've found that 4th edition D&amp;D has an awful, horrible failure mode. The party loses a fight to a TPK sooner or later (the game encourages you to fight to the last, because fights are won on a first-past-the-post principle), creating new characters takes ages, learning to play your character does as well, and the game encourages you to consider your character as an unique snowflake epic adventurer. There is no real way to take value away from death, it doesn't make the setting deeper or more interesting. The TPK basically just leaves you staring at each other in a way I've compared to a "blue screen of death".<br/><br/>Similarly an investigative game like Call of Cthulhu can have a horrible failure mode, because it's far from clear when an investigation puzzle has been "failed", and often there is no clear enemy or consequences to failure, except that nothing happens. As there is no other play content available aside from this scenario the GM prepped, you can't give up and declare the case unsolvable the way real-life detectives do, either. I've often, taking the game's objective-GM instructions by the book, ended up in a situation where the party manages to spend two hours grilling a NPC who knows nothing about the mystery, for example.<br/><br/>(Anybody feeling the need to disagree with those characterizations of those two games, <i>please</i> read the above with a "in these games as we have played them" proviso. Obviously if you play differently, then you play differently, and these snapshot examples don't apply to the way you play. They're intended merely to illustrate how a game can fail in constructing a successful failure mode, causing a clear and present motivation for the group to avoid failure altogether.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442243/#Comment_442243" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T05:14:08+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  5:14AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2015 5:15AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, we played a campaign (sadly interrupted!) over IRC with a gang of Story Games members in precisely the style Eero describes roughly a year ago.<br/><br/>You can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19tDczBN42BIIYcdWTfVkWgReVrVtbgmUvJoO8jWi2Sk/edit#gid=0" rel="nofollow">the list of characters</a> for yourself (and note the care and interest we took in recording the various characters' deaths - many of which occurred early on in the very sessions where those characters were introduced, or took part in TPKs - you can spot these short timers easily, since they're dead characters who have no XP total).<br/><br/>It's a very amusing and very functional style of game.<br/><br/>Notably for me, there was a situation where my 1st-level character ended up alone in a tower, with no obvious means of escape. (Eero was GMing from a module.) Although it was not immediately clear to me, Eero told me that he saw my chances of escape or survival as being very slim, and asked whether I wanted to play it out or trust his opinion on the hopelessness of his situation. We played it out, and, just as he said, the situation was pretty much impossible, but we enjoyed the doomed character's explorations and eventual death. (As another technique, we would sometimes simply offers "odds" on a certain event taking place - such as a character escaping a deadly situation - and roll dice whenever all parties involved agreed they were reasonable. This is a great way of cutting through hopeless and lengthy, pointless segments of play and getting back to the good stuff.)<br/><br/>The upshot of this very honest and open mode of communication is that it doesn't leave any confusion or negative feelings on anyone's part, and allows every player to depart from the (metaphorical, in this case) game table with a solid and ever-growing sense of trust and confidence in his or her fellow players (GM included).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442245/#Comment_442245" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T06:55:38+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  6:55AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of Call of Cthulhu modules contain failure text of that kind ("You never solve it, and later you wake up with a TERRIBLE FEELING", just like a real Lovecraft story!) but there's often not a clear path from the play of the game to that failure text.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are exactly two procedures in published games for this: Dogs in the Vineyard's Town Creation and Smallville's Episode Creation.<br/><br/>The challenge for adapting this to sandbox play is that both of these explicitly limit the milieu.

It's fine if you are designing a "deathtrap" with no solution, but that clearly wasn't the intent here. So if there's supposed to be a solution, you should think of one. <br/><br/>And let me repeat what I said earlier - this solution should not be THE solution, but it should be "A" solution to ensure that the problem, since it is intended to be soluble, is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442251/#Comment_442251" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T14:53:33+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  2:53PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand and appreciate that you're offering good advice, Airk - for a certain type of game the "think up one solution" heuristic is an efficient tool, and I appreciate its elegance. (I vaguely remember using it like a decade ago for something myself, in fact - can't quite place it, though.) My only objection is for characterizing it as an universal one. I wouldn't introduce this approach into my own game, for example, as I would consider this unhygienic:\n<blockquote>...since it is intended to be soluble...</blockquote>\nI hold no such intention when GMing a sandbox. In some scenarios there are NPCs trying to think up traps and puzzles that are soluble; in others there are agencies trying to create certain doom and failing; in yet others the agencies behind the dungeon try and succeed in creating something insoluble. In no case do I as GM hold an a priori opinion on whether this or that "should" be solvable by whoever happens to be playing tonight.<br/><br/>(I do realize that in the grander history of D&amp;D mine is a minority position - both the official game and probably the majority of the practicing gamers consider fairness to imply solubility. I've discussed elsewhere at length how I believe a proper sandbox to be self-balancing, and therefore not in need of this type of challenge balancing.)<br/><br/>I wouldn't harp upon such a petty doctrinaire issue otherwise, except that this was precisely Big J's question to us - whether there's anything wrong with not pre-ensuring solubility. I say that there are games for which it is not necessary, and might in fact be harmful due to the way it predisposes the GM to think about the fictional scenario. Of course there are other manners of game where it is, indeed, good to ensure a certain level of solubility.<br/><br/>It should be noted that although Paul is very gracious about my D&amp;D philosophy, I am in full sympathy for anybody thinking that we've got some weird poison meme running rampant here in our Helsinki old school D&amp;D circles, and we simply don't realize ourselves how crazy the doctrine is becoming. It's the sort of scene where people really and truly spend 40 game sessions solving the first level of Stonehell dungeon with 1st level characters (yes, it is that hard if the GM doesn't softball it), and speculate about the proper distribution of false adventure hooks and empty dungeons (red herrings and intelligence friction, you see) in a sandbox setting. Hardcore in a rather peculiar manner by most sane measure, so I don't know if J should exactly take my opinion on this matter seriously <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442253/#Comment_442253" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T15:24:59+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  3:24PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2015 3:29PM by Airk.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Allow me to be clear, because it sounds like I'm not getting across.<br/><br/>EITHER:<br/><br/>You are designing something that you believe/feel/think they players "should" be able to solve<br/>OR<br/>You are not.<br/><br/>In BOTH cases, it's worth trying to determine a solution.

It is certainly the case that we're arguing different points.<br/><br/>You're still arguing teleologically, about the end-outcome purposes of choices made in designing content. You're checking the puzzle for whether it's too easy or too hard, worrying about whether it might not be solved at all, or will be solved trivially. I'm saying that this entire framing of the question is unnecessary (for the way I play).<br/><br/>When I design a puzzle for this sort of sandbox game, I am not in fact even designing a <i>puzzle</i>, because puzzle already implies an artificial external game function. There is only a puzzle if there is somebody trying to solve something, and the entities that create things within the setting are not creating them to be solved, most of the time. Rather, I design a socio-economic environment (doesn't need to be a realistic and serious one, of course - often they're quite stylized) that causes a fictional scenario that may be interpreted as a puzzle, depending on approach vector, when adventurers come across it. There is no point in the process where I look at what I've done and evaluate it for its puzzleness. (Well there is in reality, but it happens after I've closed the book on the thing and am looking at the end result and kibitzing about it with friends. "Apparently the kind of demon I'm imagining here creates some pretty puzzle-heavy nests for itself," and that sort of thing.)<br/><br/>Maybe an example is in order. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9536425/Sniper%20Joe%27s%20Treasure.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s an adventure I wrote for last year's OPD contest. It was inspired by a dead character, as described in the adventure text. I think you'd agree that it is quite puzzle-heavy, insofar as such things go.<br/><br/>However, the primary consideration while writing that adventure was evaluating whether the gauntlet described in it fulfills the personal standards and goals of the NPC who developed the challenge in the first place. I never attempted to evaluate the difficulty level of the adventure against an ideal player's capabilities; it is what it is, and it'll mostly depend on the skill level of players whether it is "easy" or "hard" for them. I would expect hard, but that is not a primary concern for me in writing the piece.<br/><br/>This example is somewhat meta in that the adventure itself contains a NPC who is creating a puzzle, so in that sense there is indeed a puzzle in there. However, I write adventures without explicit in-fiction puzzles the same way, merely figuring out what makes sense for the setting and what is the genuine challenge proposition that the fictional environment has to offer. An adventure needs to front the challenge it offers, but that challenge does not need to be calibrated to be a good challenge for a sandbox adventure game.\n<blockquote>The whole "we play our game different" thing is actually pretty much irrelevant, because we're assuming that everyone mostly agrees on how the game "should" go.

The point being here that you should use this simple check to verify what sort of "puzzle" you have created.</blockquote>\nIt would be an awful misunderstanding of my position to think that I <i>want</i> or <i>plan</i> for a game to feature e.g. 40 sessions of character death. It is a thing that may occur, but that occurrence is an outcome of our dynamic creative process at the gaming table, and emphatically not something planned for by the GM. The mind-set is entirely different, the GM comes to the table with no preconceptions about what should happen when the rubber hits the road - when the other players hit his scenario, that is.\n<blockquote>Edit: I guess it's possible that you might just not care what kind of puzzle it is, but that seems like it's the least efficient approach here, since you're not even checking whether it makes sense in the game world.</blockquote>\nI do not care about predicting the course of events at the game table before the game is played. I do care about creating compelling and internally consistent fictional material. I believe that we can agree that it is possible to care about making sense in the game world without also caring about whether players might be able to overcome the challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442258/#Comment_442258" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T16:43:10+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  4:43PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Airk,<br/><br/>I think Eero's point here is not so much that "how we play our game differently" (as you put it) is relevant to your argument (although I'd say it is), but that it is *absolutely* relevant to what this thread is asking about. He's responding to the general topic moreso than your particular point. The OP is clearly asking about this very issue.<br/><br/>As for figuring out solutions to puzzles, I'll say that my own experience has been the opposite of yours:<br/><br/>* Coming up with a solution ahead of time tends to make it more likely that the GM (or any other player) is a) less open to other solutions (this is a subconscious effect, note, and probably operates even if you're aware of it, but is of course even worse if you are not) and b) is more likely to cause the kind of un-fun situation in play that you're describing from your own game experience.<br/><br/>* Rather, it is better to spend time thinking about the fictional details of the trap or puzzle itself. Who put it here? How is it constructed? How, exactly, does it operate? What are its strengths and what are its weaknesses?<br/><br/>This is what we're missing with the "unending staircase" trap. We have no idea how it operates, what its purpose is, or, really, any details about its function.<br/><br/>In my opinion (and I think Eero was talking about the same thing - correct me if I'm wrong, Eero), the GM's fault here was not in failing to think up a solution, but in failing to think up any fictional details about the trap itself. It's the equivalent of saying, "There is a room, and if anyone enters, they die." Without having some idea of what causes this to happen, what triggers it, whether it can be reset, and so forth, the GM has no way of judging a potential solution (e.g. what happens if someone sends in a illusory person first, and then walks in while invisible?).<br/><br/>However, you do make a good point: if there is some kind of absolutely unbeatable trap or puzzle in a game, AND your game is premised on success always being possible, perhaps it's a good idea to give a thought as to whether the trap is solvable at all.<br/><br/>I can see this coming up, in particular, with someone using a pre-designed module. For instance, if I was handed an adventure with an unending staircase, AND I didn't want any "certain failure" scenarios in my particular game (which is a very reasonable constraint for most games, I think, hardcore-play as described here notwithstanding) I'd want to give it some serious thought before I put that module into play.<br/><br/>* Who put this here?<br/>* What is its purpose?<br/>* How, exactly, does it function?<br/>* What are its limitations? (For instance, maybe it works by "teleporting" anyone who reaches a certain point on the stairs back to the bottom, and this teleportation uses up energy from a finite source.)<br/>* Did the creator intend for it to be a hopeless deathtrap, or did she have a backup plan for what to do if she ended up caught in it herself? (i.e. is there a "backdoor"?)<br/>Etc.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you need to give a thought about WHY you're so interested in including an "unsolvable" puzzle in your game in the first place. What's the purpose of this game-piece? <br/><br/>In this sense, of course, we are in complete agreement, just approaching the issue from different angles.<br/><br/>But, overall, "think about how your puzzle is constructed in enough detail to be able to judge potential solutions, telegraph danger level in a way which matches your players' expectations, and be overly generous in assigning odds of success to any player idea" is a very functional and robust way to approach this kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442259/#Comment_442259" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T16:43:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  4:43PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure those two things are not tied together.  If something is just "happenstance" then yes, I suppose it's theoretically possible, but in general, puzzles/challenges DON'T happen "by accident."   In your own example, if there is an NPC "building" the puzzle, they might very well stop and think, "Y'know, this whole thing could be short circuited by stone to mud." or something.  I think a large portion of the time, the question is relevant even if the "GM" doesn't care about the possibility of an insoluble puzzle.  These things never exist in a vacuum.  Even if the GM pretends they do.<br/><br/>And I think that your assertion that the GM comes to the table with no preconceptions about what "should" happen is perhaps somewhat...misleading. The GM may not have a "should" but he absolutely better have "may" and "may not" even if the latter category is very small.  If he doesn't, there's no way that the nature of the game can be communicated to the players, which is the one meta-assumption I've been making this whole time - that everyone is on the same page for what they want to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442261/#Comment_442261" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T17:05:41+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  5:05PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2015 5:10PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm.<br/><br/>I think a style of gaming where "puzzles/challenges happen by accident" certainly exists, particularly in a very old-school play mode, and when using pre-written modules (which often have nonsensical content) or random tables. It's not something I see too often in the modern RPG scene, of course (but is present in the OSR scene). In this style of play there is no effort to make the fictional world "coherent"; it exists solely as a challenge to the players.<br/><br/>But that's a sidenote...<br/><br/>Back on topic:<br/><br/>I'm not sure why "Y'know, this whole thing could be short circuited by stone to mud" is a superior approach to "the trap is contained within a room constructed with stone walls two feet in thickness". Either way we know that liquefying one of the walls will allow the characters to escape, but the second doesn't presume foreknowledge of the spells used nor assume any particular action on the part of the players.<br/><br/>Is there a reason why the opposite is true?

He rarely posts at Story Games, but has given this style of gaming a great deal of thought. Unsurprisingly, he had some very smart (and economical) things to say on this subject. He said he wouldn't mind if I shared them here, so here's another take on this whole thing:\n<blockquote><br/>* I'd frequently use problems without knowing the solution, but I also give a lot of leeway for improvisation and flexibility in adjucating a situation. An unsolvable problem would only be a no-no if there was no latitude to work it out in play.<br/><br/>* To look at the most common case, I think it's widely accepted in the OSR that if you put a monster that can only be hit by magic weapons in a dungeon, your obligation is not to place a magic weapon elsewhere in the dungeon - rather it's to ensure that the campaign is not a railroad that will be halted by the inability to get past that monster.<br/><br/>* Extending that analogy, I think most people would feel that it violated a sandbox contract to put in a monster that could only be defeated by "I don't know what, I'll choose what works when the players seem like they're getting frustrated by not being able to beat it" - this negates the meaningfulness of the challenge, and is basically part of railroad thinking.<br/><br/>* I'd be OK with, for example, a monster that could only be defeated by interrupting its ability to draw magical energy from its environment - I wouldn't feel the need to work out in advance exactly how the players would do that, it doesn't feel like baseless fiat to decide whether an attempt to do so would or wouldn't succeed.<br/><br/>I'd put more thought into making sure there were ways for the players to learn how this monster works - I feel it's more important to make sure that the players have informed choices than to predict a decision tree at each point.<br/><br/>* I'm totally OK with "if you stick your head into the demon's mouth it will be annihilated, no saving throw." The same caveats about latitude and railroad apply. It would be poor form if the player says "I put a stick in the mouth" and you say "It sucks you in, you die!" - there needs to be freedom to investigate. And the campaign needs to have rolling up a new PC be a valid option, not a derailment.<br/><br/>* I'm with you on wanting to signal that sudden death is on the line. Once you put a few annihilators into a campaign the players will start looking for hints, but I enjoy play more if there is a way to mutually engage and dis-engage pixel-bitching mode without breaking immersion.<br/></blockquote>\nI mentioned that we'd been having a discussion about these issues on Story Games, and briefly summarized some of the questions that came up in this thread thus:<br/><br/>"One poster brought up an example of a 'neverending staircase'. Once you get on the stairs, you can't get off, you just keep climbing or descending and you never get anywhere.<br/><br/>What do you think of something like that in a game?<br/><br/>The group played for hours and couldn't solve the puzzle, so they all left frustrated.<br/><br/>We had three potential solutions identified (not necessarily compatible):<br/>1. Play in a style where total failure is acceptable. i.e. the group decides, "Ok, we failed. Let's roll up new characters!"<br/>(This should be clearly communicated before you even play, of course.)<br/>2. The GM should give some deliberate thought to the fictional details of the trap/puzzle, so as to be able to judge possible solutions (and should judge very generously when potential solutions are suggested), so as to keep the game interesting for everyone.<br/>3. The GM should think up at least one specific solution to the puzzle beforehand.<br/><br/>I'm curious which seems more functional or more familiar to you in your gaming experience."<br/><br/>His responses:\n<blockquote><br/>* The general rule is don't be a dick. Playing for hours while stuck on a gotcha trap, I gotta think the DM failed this rule.<br/><br/>* Your solution <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> seems most functional in this case. It's a staircase and we all know some stuff about staircases; does climbing the walls get you off the magic escalator? Could a 50' rope get past the part of the stairs that magically repeats? Etc. <br/><br/>As long as the situation is concrete, like stairs, I'd feel OK figuring out these details in play.<br/><br/>* <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> I'd want to use in a situation where it's clear that you failed - this trap is bad for that because if you narrate "you climb stairs until your water runs out and you die" the players endlessly want to say "wait before then I try this and that!"<br/><br/>* <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> seems to me to lead in the direction of a railroad, better to have leeway for many solutions because the tendency will be to steer players toward the one you pre-determined.<br/><br/>* I would totally put this into a dungeon, but for publication I'd want a sidebar talking about how to keep it from being un-fun. The Swords &amp; Wizardry starter dungeon was good at this.<br/></blockquote>\nFor what it's worth. I thought his points about "giving the group latitude to work out in play", "making sure the players have meaningful choices, rather than attempting to predict every branch on a decision tree", and, of course "don't be a dick" (i.e. remember the social context of the game, and make sure everyone accepts the responsibility to keep it fun) were particularly interesting and on point.<br/><br/>Tavis has a knack for explaining this kind of thing in simple terms. (Not surprising, given the amount of time he's spent thinking about these issues, as an OSR advocate in general and a professional publisher of a top-tier game in this playstyle in particular.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442265/#Comment_442265" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T19:35:18+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  7:35PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like all that explanation.

(<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>? Maybe you have?)<br/><br/>I'm only asking because I've never had that experience; it sounds very foreign to me.<br/><br/>When an "unsolvable" challenge has come up in a game I'm playing, it's been generally due to:<br/><br/>1) a GM trying too hard to block off all possible avenues of tackling it ("Oh, and the walls are anti-magic, too, of course!") during the design stage, or <br/>2) the GM is concerned with the difficulty of the challenge ("it must be hard enough!") and blocks particular solutions the players come up with during play itself (the scenario Tavis references above, near the top of my last post - the GM is unwilling to accept possible solutions because she feels the timing isn't right for the challenge to be circumvented just yet), or<br/>3) the GM has a particular solution in mind, but the players are unable to guess what it is.<br/><br/>(#1 can be another unintended consequence of trying to come up with solutions, in my experience: "Oh, crap! My puzzle can be circumvented with a 'Stone to Mud' spell. I'd better add an automatic 'Dispel Magic' enchantment, then... oh, and I guess I'll need a creature who's immune to normal weapons so the fighter can't just lift the gate...". This kind of thinking is dangerous, in my experience. I much prefer an approach where the GM devises logical challenges without taking into consideration specific character abilities, and lets gameplay progress naturally from there.)<br/><br/>There is, of course, also:<br/><br/>4) The challenge is solvable, but the characters do not have the mechanical leverage to do so. (For example, a dragon with 500 hit points and an AC of -10: the gang of 1st-level characters will almost certainly not be able to defeat it, but of course the challenge remains solvable in principle, just too difficult for this particular bunch.)<br/><br/>It seems to me that most sandbox-style games accept this without a problem.<br/><br/>It's never happened to me to come up with a challenge that <i>sounds</i> doable and then only later realize that it has no solution; that I've <i>accidentally</i> created an unsolvable challenge. (Particularly in a sandbox situation; of course there's nothing wrong with a challenge that is too difficult for the players - the issue here is about a challenge which is unsolvable <i>in principle</i>.)<br/><br/>I suppose that the advice to "see if there is any possible solution at all" only makes sense if it takes into account the tools available to the players: "Can the players, given these characters and these particular powers, solve this problem?"<br/><br/>That, again, sounds like a slippery slope to me. I much prefer a playstyle where that isn't a consideration. (But, of course, it will be for some people and some games.)<br/><br/>However!<br/><br/>I should admit that I find the very idea of a truly unsolvable challenge to be a fantastic proposition:<br/><br/>In the real world, there is no such thing as an unsolvable challenge. (For instance, you cannot build a prison that no one, given unlimited resourcefulness and attempts, could not escape from.)<br/><br/>Unless we're dealing with quantum mechanics, a philosophical conundrum, or something similarly far afield (perhaps a time travel paradox?), any logically-coherent puzzle will have some kind of solution, even if it comes to down to simple brute force destruction. <br/><br/>This is especially the case in a roleplaying scenario (a la D&amp;D), where there exists a precedent of allowing a roll for the success of even incredibly unlikely efforts (like a hobbit stabbing a mighty dragon with a knife, when a "natural 20" will allow damage to be dealt). This implies to me that any remotely plausible solution might be assigned a (very low, sure) probability of success, making any challenge ultimately defeatable, given enough resourcefulness and some luck.<br/><br/>This is my objection to the "inescapable staircase" puzzle: it seems here that the designer has simply <i>decreed</i> that it has the <i>quality</i> of being inescapable, rather than explaining how it works, what triggers it, and so forth.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear from anyone on what this actually looks like in play. Can you relate a story from an actual game? <br/><br/>I don't doubt that it can happen, but I'm having trouble imagining what it looks like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442267/#Comment_442267" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T20:11:58+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  8:11PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm imagining this more as a mental exercise and it probably won't take more than ten seconds.

Well, we're certainly in agreement on that! (Particularly your last paragraph.)<br/><br/>How about my earlier question, though:<br/><br/>Is there any advantage to thinking, as the GM/designer, "If they can find a way to disrupt the mana flow to the Chaos Stone..." instead of "the Device is powered by the Chaos Stone, which constantly draws power from the mana flow in order to operate"?<br/><br/>I find the latter to be less problematic and more fun, as well.

Either way we know that liquefying one of the walls will allow the characters to escape, but the second doesn't presume foreknowledge of the spells used nor assume any particular action on the part of the players.<br/><br/>Is there a reason why the opposite is true? If I might be missing something here, I'm open to that possibility.</blockquote>\nI find your advice on this part <i>absolutely</i> spot on, by the way, and excellent advice for this kind of gaming:\n<blockquote>[...] and C) You have some idea of what kind of information to give the players if they start gathering information.<br/><br/>[...] the GM [...] was unprepared to [...] provide information on what sorts of solutions might be acceptable ("Whatever sounds feasable"... but with no idea what feasible IS).</blockquote>\nOne fun trick I picked up from Eero is to use information-gathering by the players (when attempting to solve a particular challenge) as an excuse to invent and/or spew information about the diegetic setting.<br/><br/>For instance, a player interested in attempting a "Stone to Mud" escape from the staircase might look into the construction of the walls.<br/><br/>As a GM, this is an excellent excuse to come up with some backstory about whoever designed the trap, the local standards on architecture, or perhaps what kind of technology was available and/or fashionable at the time when this place was built.<br/><br/>It conveys the information with flair and enriches the game, while still leaving the actual problem-solving in the players' hands. There's no reason the GM can't make this kind of stuff up on the spot, either, so long as they are consistent about it afterwards. In the process, the fictional setting grows depth, and the players develop better metrics in order to be able to create solutions as the game progresses (e.g. once they know what kind of brickwork the Neredri civilization used, they can guess themselves whether they'll be able to enter the castle with a single Stone to Mud spell, or whether they will need a larger battering ram).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442270/#Comment_442270" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-29T20:44:31+00:00" title="January 29, 2015  8:44PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, this bit from Dave is worth repeating, I think - he describes this whole process very well with few words:\n<blockquote><br/>When I do this [arbitrate the resolution of a difficult challenge], I work with the players.  I try to get clear on why they think something will work; when I'm skeptical, I look to be convinced.  If the players can't even convince themselves, then no dice, but otherwise, we usually work something out together.<br/></blockquote>\nIn this case, it might look like:<br/><br/>-"I want to hit that golden rod with my sword!"<br/>-"Why?"<br/>-"Perhaps it channels mana into the Chaos Stone, and I'd like to cut of the mana supply."<br/><br/>Now the GM is in the position to judge the (fictional) possibility of such an attempt working and offer some odds to the player. Alternatively, if the player is making mistaken assumptions, the GM can try to correct those by giving the player more information. ("No, the rod doesn't connect to the Stone. It seems to be part of the apparatus itself. What you see connecting to the Stone are the silver cables coming down from the ceiling.")<br/><br/>Now there exists the possibility for new problem-solving and new ideas, without getting stuck in a rut.<br/><br/>The fictional situation becomes richer, the GM can use this as an excuse to develop the background further (perhaps she can explain that the character identifies the golden rod due to some markings in the gold, or something like that), and to the players it's ultimately satisfying because they are collecting more actionable information. Even if they don't solve the challenge now, they'll have a better chance of doing so later, and they are learning potentially useful information in the process.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442295/#Comment_442295" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-30T13:40:18+00:00" title="January 30, 2015  1:40PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I've definitely experienced some annoying puzzles in D&amp;D games of yore, where it was impossible to progress unless you basically just guessed what the GM wanted you to do, text-adventure/Parsely-style. I feel like there was a lot of that my freshman year in college, with two different GMs (both girls, incidentally; I'm still friends with one of them some 16 years later and she's improved in many ways, though still runs into problems surrounding these sorts of issues). But I mean, we were teens playing D&amp;D2E; puzzles were not our biggest problem as a group by far. :-)<br/><br/>I do have a more recent, longish example that is similar but the same as the topic of this thread. The puzzle involved figuring out a code-word from a string of characters. It was completely diegetic, i.e., logical for it to be there. The problem was certain letters were capitalized, which makes the puzzle trivially easy.

I see this tower as not being sandbox-friendly.  To me, a sandbox shouldn't have railroads unless they lead to the only appropriate inevitably, which is PC death (or insanity, corruption, etc).  I would handle this tower obstacle/puzzle in different ways; here are some examples:<br/><br/>1) The tower has a door that leads to a treasure.  If you can figure out how to get into the correct door, you access the treasure.  Otherwise you can leave.<br/><br/>2) The tower slowly fills with water.  If you can't solve it in time, you die.  Usually though in this case I wouldn't have used a no-solution puzzle.  Or, if I did I might save this puzzle for a higher level when the adventurers possess more open-ended magic items that they could use as tools in creative ways I can't predict.  Also, this style of play I would definitely not spring on a group without discussion.  There are all kinds of possible contexts for this.  As Eero says, character creation should be blazingly fast, as well.<br/><br/>3) The tower slowly fills with water.  If you can't solve it in time, you die.  However, this tower's magical resonance connects it to the land of the dead.  Not only do you die, but so do all your items.  You are now ghosts abandoned to the Netherworld.  Have fun. I don't know if this is considered "fail-upward", but I would consider the Netherworld to just be another part of the sandbox.<br/><br/>I find solution 3 most interesting with the caveat that I wouldn't use this technique as a result for every "failed" puzzle.  My preference would be to use a mix of all 3 types, above for a variety of play experience.  But I wouldn't never use the tower puzzle as the way your DM did, Airk.  My thoughts are simply that, what I call "closed puzzles" aren't appropriate for sandbox play.  But that's not related to the "no-solution" aspect.  In my initial example of the dragon, the adventurers can escape, assuming they are successful at doing so (probably down to dice rolls, or equipment, or cunning ideas, etc)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442741/#Comment_442741" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-10T15:22:03+00:00" title="February 10, 2015  3:22PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I feel like I've definitely experienced some annoying puzzles in D&amp;D games of yore, where it was impossible to progress unless you basically just guessed what the GM wanted you to do, text-adventure/Parsely-style.</blockquote>\nNote that even most Inform 7 games don't work like that.

Text adventures, also known as "interactive fiction", is a type of computer game. Many modern text adventures aren't written as specific scenes prompting for specific inputs. Instead, they're written as descriptions of places and the items therein, and the properties of those items.<br/>When Inform 7 (a programming language for making text adventures) was released in 2006, it was a huge "aha!" moment for me as DM.<br/><br/>Paul's example "the Device is powered by the Chaos Stone, which constantly draws power from the mana flow in order to operate" is bang on target for how Inform 7 code looks.<br/>That's how I try to write my prep now too, rather than trying to predict specific events and interactions.<br/><br/>Here is an example of Inform 7 code:\n<blockquote>The Bar is south of the Foyer. The printed name of the bar is "Foyer Bar".<br/>The Bar is dark.  "The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed<br/>after the opulence of the foyer to the north, is completely empty.<br/>There seems to be some sort of message scrawled in the sawdust on the floor."<br/><br/>The scrawled message is scenery in the Bar. Understand "floor" or "sawdust" as the message.<br/><br/>Neatness is a kind of value. The neatnesses are neat, scuffed, and trampled.<br/>The message has a neatness. The message is neat.</blockquote>\nThat code was written by Emily Short and Graham Nelson. This is the code that the compiler then turns into a game. The analogy for TRPGs is that this is the DM's notes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442789/#Comment_442789" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-12T16:05:20+00:00" title="February 12, 2015  4:05PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>I read up on Inform 7 a little, and it looks very cool.

I already knew about improvising, but all the adventures I had ever read (from the 90:s...) consisted of prepared scenes, and so was the one book about prep I had access too (<i>Robin's Laws</i>, one of his rare misses.) To me, this seemed impossible to run (because the "what if they veer of the path?" question, of course) so I improvised instead.<br/>This was how I viewed roleplaying for well over a decade!

(As you know, Paul, since you've replied to my posts about running The Lost City and The Caverns of Thracia.)\n<blockquote>That makes sense, even if it seems painfully obvious to me.</blockquote>\nPainful is the right word. I've been resentful and bitter against the 90:s style RPGs because they were so anti-didactic in this regard. Though now that I've seen old-school D&amp;D in action, I realize that that approach can be applied (with varying degrees of success) to some of them.

In games where you get attached to your characters and don't want them to die randomly, it's <i>extra</i> insane, but even with disposable characters, no one enjoys dying <i>for no reason</i>.  <br/><br/>The problem with the staircase isn't that it kills you, it's that it kills you without showing you how you screwed up and thus could do better next time.

I sure wouldn't.</blockquote>\nSo you wouldn't be interested in a say post-apocalyptic sandbox, with 15% of the hexes contaminated by NBC weapons? Just as an example of what that sort of thing would look like in practice. The "logic of this fantasy world" in this case being "horrible poisons have been spewed here and there by the ancients, so be sure not to step on them".<br/><br/>I don't see that even as a particularly extreme proposition. It would surely be a conservative world, one where you pay heed to folklore and keep well out of the places considered taboo by the local populace. Bonus points for picking up a variety of equipment to forewarn and mitigate the death hexes.<br/><br/>Note that if your sandbox does not actually provide such intelligible causes for the death hexes as my NBC example, but rather insists on a completely non-intelligible and arbitrary death scheme that players cannot relate to in any way, then we might start questioning the artistic impact and strategic interest of the scheme. After all, nobody is saying that GM not being responsible for outcomes entails the GM not being responsible for bringing interesting and relatable challenges to the table.<br/><br/>(Or I don't know, is somebody saying that you can fill the sandbox with anything whatsoever? David sounds like somebody is, but if so, I missed it. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned it's obvious that the game needs a compelling subject matter and a functional parsing that enables a dynamic back and forth process of negotiation between the players and the GM. That's far from any arbitrary content being OK.)<br/><br/>I think that while it is attractive to ask the GM to make sure that their challenges are "just right", it is not a practically achievable goal. The GM cannot know what level of challenge the players are capable of tackling, and he cannot in fact even guarantee that they will relate to the provided material in a constructive manner. I'd go as far as to say that even looking for some sort of moral justification is a mirage: you cannot even provide an adventure with which you could say that it's the fault of the players if they don't get it.<br/><br/>This is why pre-negotiation of the challenge is so important: the players themselves have to participate in constructing the context and approach vector towards the material, and in this manner create their own challenge; only in this way we guarantee that a challenge has, in fact, been understood and accepted, and thus hallowed even in failure.<br/><br/>As a practical example, let's consider a goblin camp in the wilderness. A GM who believes in their ability to pre-create challenges relies on the assumption that the adventurers will want to kill the goblins - that's the challenge, to kill the goblins. Therefore he determines the number of goblins and their weaponry in a way that provides for a fair fight - maybe he has a precalculated encounter pointbuy like modern D&amp;D, or he's eyeballing. Whatever.<br/><br/>Then, adventurers come upon the goblin camp, and we see the epistemological problems with this entire arrangement:<br/><b>* The GM cannot guarantee success:</b> The fight was pre-balanced to be "fair", not a sure thing. Thus the adventurers might fail. If the adventurers fail, was it because the GM misjudged the difficulty, because the rules for balancing encounters are broken, or because the players under-performed? How do you know?<br/><b>* The GM cannot guarantee constructive approach:</b> What if the adventurers attempt to parlay with the goblins? We're assuming for the sake of the argument that the GM has not considered this avenue of approach in advance - if he had, we could just assume some other truly unexpected approach vector. How likely will this new challenge, parlaying with the goblins, be fair and well-considered? How likely is it that the goblins are trivially easy to parlay with, or practically impossible? If it will in fact somehow be a fair challenge, even without the GM having pre-balanced the consideration, what prevents the initial fighting challenge from being balanced in the same way, without pre-planning?<br/><b>* The GM cannot guarantee moral high ground:</b> The adventurers fail against the goblins and the evening is ruined. Was it the fault of the players for not getting that <i>obviously</i> they were supposed to sneak up on the goblins and attack without warning instead of announcing themselves like they did, or was it the fault of the GM for not having prepared a sufficiently fair encounter? How do you know?<br/><br/>My alternative to the seemingly intractable morass that challenge balancing presents is to let challenge emerge naturally from the beliefs that players hold regarding the fiction of the game: encounter goblins, determine whether you want something from the goblins, determine what gives you the best odds of success, and then execute. It might be that the combination of goblins and tactics proves entirely trivial, in which case we can pass over this material quickly and move the game forward; it might be that the goblins prove impossible to conquer, in which case we'll know better than to try next time. Whatever the outcome, the procedure of the game is not reliant on the GM somehow divining in advance what kind of material will be construed as a challenge and tackled in a satisfying manner.<br/><br/>If it seems a wonder that my games ever encounter any challenges at all, keep in mind that the GM is mandated to bring interesting, strategically provocative stuff to the table, and therefore it is not actually that hard for the players to find something worthwhile to do in the game. The default proposition is attempting dangerous commando hijinks in hopes of finding treasure. While I would not trust myself to judge whether the party can beat three kobolds, I certainly do trust myself to figure out with the players whether they dare to try it, and face the consequences if they fail.<br/><br/>In summary: while I don't think that you can pass off anything whatsoever as sandbox material, I do still think that worrying about challenge balancing at the content design level is far, far premature. The time to worry about whether a challenge is present is when you've got characters on the ground, trying to accomplish something - only when you know the position and direction of the characters can you possibly know whether they are facing a challenge or not. Trying to predetermine challenge is like trying to set up a cliff-face obstacle without knowing which direction the party is coming from; either you railroad them to the cliff-face in your planned orientation, or you accept that the cliff-face will only become a challenge if and when the party wants to go over it, and not before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442810/#Comment_442810" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T00:50:27+00:00" title="February 13, 2015 12:50AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2015 1:06AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that precisely balancing challenges is impossible for the GM before they know what the players are going to do, and I agree that if you know what the players are going to do, then it isn't a sandbox.<br/><br/>But I never mentioned precise balancing.  I don't demand that.  All I demand is meaningful interactivity.<br/><br/>Would I play in a setting contaminated by toxic weapons?  <i>Only if</i> the game contains opportunities to heed folklore and find/create death-hex detectors (or something of equivalent utility).  Otherwise, no.<br/><br/>This is exactly my point.  The GM's decision to include death hexes, regardless of any "cool and consistent setting" logic it includes, cannot be made completely regardless of "so what will that be like for the players?"  If the answer is "sudden death, with nothing learned," then ugh, please don't do that.  If the answer is, "sudden death, with enough information learned to do better next time," then rock on, I'll play that*.<br/><br/>Regarding <i>when</i> to make these GM decisions, sure, your "what till the characters are on the ground and doing something" sounds good to me.  It's what I do too.  Other GMs feel differently.  All I'm saying is that "how will this play" is necessarily a big part of the GM's creative decisions, whenever they occur.<br/><br/>* Caveat: I actually think sudden death is generally a shitty option.  In the specific case of a game that's set up to support it (quickly create next character, etc., as you covered previously), then sure, I'm on board.  Otherwise, I prefer other failure consequences, such that it's the characters who learn from their mistakes and try again, not just the players.  For example, "see sudden death in the distance, and build a detector to avoid it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442811/#Comment_442811" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T01:28:00+00:00" title="February 13, 2015  1:28AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2015 1:53AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a brainstorm for a GM tool:<br/><br/>Whenever your players are approaching your content as a challenge (or are about to), quickly check this list:<br/>- <b>Might they suffer meaningful loss?</b><br/>-- NO -&gt; <b>Might they achieve meaningful gain?</b><br/>---- NO.

Or do you actually mean that it suffices for the GM to think that they totally should be able to achieve one of these? The difference is, of course, that in the latter case we're just constructing justifications in case something goes wrong, rather than ensuring that nothing will go wrong.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, my own approach relies on this type of scenario being an extremely rare corner case, and therefore within the boundaries of acceptable uncertainty. (I mean, really - how do you manage to kill yourself without learning anything from the ordeal...) Because a properly adventurous setting created in good faith (without the GM intentionally attempting to create your particular conditions) will only rarely evolve a situation that utterly blindsides the players like this, and the players know that the GM is not doing it to them intentionally, it is actually OK for it to happen from time to time.<br/><br/>I think that the closest I've probably come to this sort of situation has been the "the adventurers have powerful enemies who send assassins in the night" scenario. Surprisingly common, that - we used to joke that mid-level play starts around level 4, when your character's inevitably attracted a powerful nemesis of some sort. 1st-level adventurers often have the same issue with goblins and such; first you anger them by attacking, and then they come back in the night to take revenge (and scalps). We have generally played these situations as they fall, and have not found it disinteresting or bad for play.<br/><br/>I think that part of why the assassin scenario is acceptable is that the GM is basically accountable for their actions, so if they have some random assassin come slit your throat under cover of darkness, you're usually in for a story time immediately afterwards: who it was and when you did something to attract that sort of attention. Basically the only legit reason for the GM to not spill is if the ball is still in play - that is, the information has strategic currency and it'll be more interesting to navigate the on-going campaign situation without knowing why exactly your last character died. It is vastly more common for the players to have a fair amount of meta knowledge, simply because it's much more entertaining to appreciate the proceedings when you know what's going on.<br/><br/>It occurs to me that one of my favourite D&amp;D scenarios, <i>The Tower of Love</i>, is rather close to the sort of screw-job that is being speculated about in this thread. Without spoiling this brilliant little adventure for anybody, it suffices to say that actual play experiences with it have not carried out the idea that unsolvable situations that lead to inevitable death are ruinous to an adventure sandbox. My experiences with other LotFP adventures with similar themes, e.g. <i>Death Frost Doom</i>, indicate the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442815/#Comment_442815" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T05:07:51+00:00" title="February 13, 2015  5:07AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2015 5:14AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a one-time victim of <i>The Tower of Love</i>, I should probably chime in, but time is short right now.<br/><br/>Mainly, I agree with this:\n<blockquote>really - how do you manage to kill yourself without learning anything from the ordeal...) Because a properly adventurous setting created in good faith (without the GM intentionally attempting to create your particular conditions) will only rarely evolve a situation that utterly blindsides the players like this, and the players know that the GM is not doing it to them intentionally, it is actually OK for it to happen from time to time.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's been my experience precisely. How do you *accidentally* create an absolutely insurmountable challenge which it is impossible to learn anything about, or learn anything from failure?<br/><br/>That sounds incredibly improbable.<br/><br/>The key is proper communication between the players. As long as the GM makes it clear that death is a possibility, and takes every opportunity to communicate information to the players (which I think a GM should gleefully embrace in this kind of game, much like a Dogs GM does with the Town's issues and NPC attitudes), it can be quite painless. It's just crossed expectations which can cause problems.<br/><br/>Eero, in my experience playing with him, is never afraid to step out of character in order discuss this kind of thing in objective terms (and does so routinely during play). When I was playing in <i>The Tower of Love</i>, for instance, he just came out and said, "By the way, I'm pretty your character is in over his head here, and has little chance of survival. Do you still want to play this out? If so, fine. But we can also just say the character is lost, his fate uncertain, and roll up a new character - anytime you wish." After that I remember we even had a discussion about how this particular adventure's main function in a campaign might be to see how hungry PCs are about chasing hooks: in this case, the best way to engage scenario might very well be not to ever go to the Tower in the first place.<br/><br/>Of course, all this only works in the sort of context we're discussing: a high-lethality sandbox, with clear communication about the sort of game that it is before and during play.<br/><br/>I should also add that Dave's breakdown of this kind of situation is spot-on, as usual. It's just a bit orthogonal to this whole (very specific) approach to gaming - technically correct, but not really necessary when a game is going along the right channels because everyone's made sure to get on the same page.<br/><br/>For me as GM, the key is to take advantage of all opportunities to deliver more information to the players. In the case of "instant death" in an exploration of a mysterious terrain hex, for example, of course we'd have fun describing the details of the death, discuss potential future plans, the impact of such a thing on the surroundings/setting, and so forth.<br/><br/>(For example, given this hypothetical setup where the terrain around features places where you simply can't go without dying, there would *of course* be some folk legends about it, stories of people disappearing, maybe signs someone put up to warn visitors, or some suspiciously-empty graveyards to mourn those lost to such a fate, and so forth. Animal trails staying away from those areas, perhaps? Some local guides who refuse to enter the "Woods of the Dead" or some such? I mean, why wouldn't there be? It's logical, believable, internally consistent and the game is much more fun that way, so it's win-win. You're going to have a better time playing with those parameters than doing some weird thing where the GM is playing 'gotcha' with the players and actively attempting to make sure they fall into his all-powerful trap. If they get curious enough, they'll go explore it themselves, after all - but by that point they have a sense of what's at stake.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442816/#Comment_442816" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T08:45:56+00:00" title="February 13, 2015  8:45AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2015 9:34AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>a properly adventurous setting created in good faith . . . will only rarely evolve a situation that utterly blindsides the players like this</blockquote>My contention is that this is true <i>for you</i> only because of all the other meta-level and social contract-level policies and practices you have in place.  Your set-up demands are limited because your troubleshooting protocols are excellent.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is that you shouldn't discount those protocols, take them for granted, assume that other folks use them, or assume that play still works without them.<br/><br/>It is <i>extremely</i> easy for a GM to decide, "the creators of this dungeon would leave a pit trap here with a portal to the Fire plane at the bottom; it used to be an elemental temple, after all" and then figure they've done their job, and fail to keep an eye out for what the result will be when this particular party encounters it in this particular circumstance (e.g. running from something that's chasing them).  It is easy for a GM to do this over and over and over if they don't have any best practices to intervene.\n<blockquote>the players know that the GM is not doing it to them intentionally, it is actually OK for it to happen from time to time.</blockquote>If the social contract approves utterly random loss of characters, then I agree; this is not only permissible, but good, for the sense of danger it engenders.  I personally don't want to lose my guy without any say in the matter, though, and I'm sure I'm not alone.\n<blockquote>How do you evaluate in advance whether players have the means to garner advance warning, are able to avoid an encounter or will learn from it without actually running them through the encounter?</blockquote>I don't think every GM needs to do it in advance.  I sure don't.  But I know some GMs who are extremely uncomfortable with any ad lib in challenge gaming, so they would write into the world things like "all death hexes have already been encountered by someone, and are marked with warnings which provide X amount of actionable info".\n<blockquote>Or do you actually mean that it suffices for the GM to think that they totally should be able to achieve one of these? The difference is, of course, that in the latter case we're just constructing justifications in case something goes wrong, rather than ensuring that nothing will go wrong.</blockquote>I don't see much value in constructing justifications.  If the GM replaces "totally should" with "probably will" and is accurate, then that's at least something.  But good prep or good ad lib protocols would be better.\n<blockquote>I think that part of why the assassin scenario is acceptable is that the GM is basically accountable for their actions, so if they have some random assassin come slit your throat under cover of darkness, you're usually in for a story time immediately afterwards</blockquote>I think we're talking about different problems here.  You seem to be surmising that my worry is that the GM will simply be a dick and I won't like them.  What I'm actually worried about is that the fiction will produce a no-fun game outcome and the GM will view this as unavoidable.  "This became a bad game because of these Good Story Time reasons!" doesn't help at all -- yes, the GM's not a dick, but no, it doesn't fix broken gameplay.<br/><br/>If death by assassin is the failure consequence of the PCs pissing off powerful and mobile enemies and failing to take proper precautions, then awesome.  I love that, as player and GM.  There is nothing problematic about that in my eyes.<br/><br/>If the assassins have spells to locate you and put you to sleep, though, so your precautions (or lack thereof) are <i>irrelevant</i>, then <i>that</i> would suck.  You haven't reaped the fruits of failure, you've just had someone trip over the cord of your Xbox and unplug your game in mid-play.  Why should that ever happen?<br/><br/>No GM ever has the fiction completely dictate to them whether the assassins will or will not have scrying and sleep spells.  There is room to consider whether such things will ruin play.  A GM who fails to ever use that room at any point is doing their game a disservice.<br/><br/>I'm not saying there's only one solution to this.  There are infinite solutions!  Maybe the assassins <i>do</i> have the perfect spells for the job, but one of them breaks a twig before casting and the PCs have a chance to respond.  Or maybe it's a meta thing, where the GM says, "You <i>really</i> want to return to the <i>same</i> hotel where the Death Cult saw you when you got them <i>extremely mad</i> at you?"  Different methods for different groups.  I'm just saying that a functional game always has <i>something</i>.\n<blockquote>Dave's breakdown . . . [is] just a bit orthogonal to this whole (very specific) approach to gaming - technically correct, but not really necessary when a game is going along the right channels because everyone's made sure to get on the same page.</blockquote>Agreed.  I was assuming that the contributions from Airk, Big J Money and others were evidence that not all sandbox challenge games being discussed in this thread fall under this very specific approach.  I'm trying to go a little broader, and leave no cornerstones of Helsinki-style unmentioned, so other sandboxers have a better idea of what it takes.

As is often the case, I only object to normative umbrella claims that are clearly disproven by personal experiences of this or that gamer. In this case, my claim is that a sanity check heuristic is apparently not strictly necessary in challenge design because I've been getting by just fine without one for soon to be a decade myself <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I'll also emphasize that my position is not exactly a purely naturalistic one when it comes to conducting a sandbox: I do not believe it to be sufficient for the GM to simply simulate a world and let things fall as they may. The reason for this is essentially in efficiency of depiction, the way humans react to boredom, and the fact that most settings do not provide interesting content 24/7. Saying that it suffices to simulate steady like a train is like saying that you'll get good television by bringing a camera and broadcasting everything, unedited.<br/><br/>Because of this editing issue my position on GMing is very focused on challenge discovery: the group needs to work together to actively abstract out of boring routines and zoom into the actually pertinent bits of the fictional fabric. This is seen in a simple form when downtime passes for the adventurers, but there are a lot of elements in the game that have nothing to do with realism, but everything to do with bringing players face to face with challenges. Random encounter procedures, the way adventurers miraculously hear about adventure propositions, the timing of adventure opportunities - everything is geared towards actually achieving interesting situations. Given a choice between the PCs missing the adventure train or just making it as the train leaves the station, the agenda of the game mandates that they make it so they can die of something slightly more interesting than old age and boredom.<br/><br/>One way to think about this selective reality - a way we've often discussed at the table - is to say that the player character adventurers have the privilege or curse to be the exact people to whom interesting things tend to happen. If there is exactly one vampire in a city of 10,000 people, hunting one person a night, you know I'm gonna roll like 1/6 (15%) about whether it'll be one of you guys - at most a 1/20 if it seems like we don't need this magnified probability for trouble right here and now. It is simply necessary to magnify the probability of adventure if we want exciting opportunities and hazards to happen ever.<br/><br/>(Why is the probability of that vampire attack not 100% to ensure an exciting vampire fight? It's because a golden mean is necessary between realism and adventurousness, and because the GM does not want the responsibility for the outcome of the encounter - particularly not when the realistic deduction really is that the vampire is rather unlikely to attack this particular PC over the thousands of NPC alternatives. By setting a reasonably low probability for events that realistically would be extremely unlikely, we can enjoy those events occurring within the lifetime of a campaign while still keeping them unpredictable and unlikely enough for players to discount them in their planning.)<br/><br/>All this is relevant to the question at hand in that this challenge-oriented parsing of the setting probably affects the likelihood of "unsolvable challenges" occurring in some complex manner when compared to a hypothetical "pure simulation". On the one hand we might speculate that because everybody's on the lookout for some setting-appropriate adventure tropes, we might end up de-emphasizing boring and stupid possibilities like tripping and breaking your neck, and thus we get less unsolvable challenges than we "should". On the other hand, maybe this insistence on interpreting all evidence towards excitement would cause the GM to actively introduce elements that prove in hidsight to combine into an unfair challenge? Difficult to say whether this kind of relationship to the setting actually increases or decreases the occurrence of utterly unfair challenges.<br/><br/>For my own purposes, though, I'm happy with the two observations from above: unfair and unsolvable challenges are pretty rare even without me being on guard about them, and the facts of a lethal playstyle make them not all that dissimilar from situations where the players simply fail due to their own incompetence, and therefore not all that remarkable. For these reasons I believe it better to not privilege teleological filters in choosing what kind of content gets into the game.

As a player, I'm encountering challenges and doing my best to overcome them (but also "introducing playing pieces" when I'm not in the active play cycle, such as when I suggest, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if there were no wizards in this campaign?" or whatever other thing).<br/><br/>As a GM, though, I'm thinking of myself as a <i>curious scientist</i>, who introduces elements to the formula and then carries them through to their logical conclusions, which we can all discuss afterwards.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443127/#Comment_443127" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-23T05:56:10+00:00" title="February 23, 2015  5:56AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My usual rules for myself:<br/><br/>1. Try to have a solution. It doesn't have to be THE solution. Heck, it shouldn't be. But if you have one, then if folks don't come up with one on their own, you can use yours -- suggest it, guide them to it, give them an Idea roll, or say, "Here's what I had in mind -- I'm open to other ideas as well."<br/><br/>2. But, if you don't have a solution, that's not necessarily a problem. For my home group, I've said, "Okay, so that's the situation. I don't have a solution in mind, and I'll accept anything reasonable." I try to have a broad definition of "reasonable".<br/><br/>3. If I have an actual puzzle, it it's tricky, it has to be something I KNOW the players will get. Otherwise, it should be easy enough that they have to take, oh, maybe a minute or two to figure it out. Anything longer is too long.<br/><br/>Those, as I said, are my rules. One GMs have different, but also workable rules. For death traps in a pulp game, there were various ideas: The second or third method should work, for dramatic timing. The first method was fine, but needed some modification -- this is something I've seen used in larps -- suggest something. If it's solid, it works. If not, the GM thinks about what's missing and tells the player, "Okay, you would need to do X and Y, but once you do, yes, that will work."<br/><br/>There was one time in a pulp game where the GM made the mistake of giving us a coded message. It was a cipher, and one of the players started working on it. What no one realized until later was that the GM had made a mistake or two so it wasn't crackable.<br/><br/>The GM, who had a functional brain, asked periodically, "Shall I just give you the answer?" He was perfectly willing to assume that the character would have cracked it. But, the player stubbornly insisted on trying to crack it, using all the right tactics, but running against the wall of the unsuspected error.<br/><br/>The GM broke first -- the player was willing to keep trying. But, the GM insisted -- correctly -- on handing us the answer. The idea was that we should work on the cipher ourselves only so long as it was fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443129/#Comment_443129" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-23T07:21:32+00:00" title="February 23, 2015  7:21AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2015 7:21AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All great stuff, Lisa!

Everything in the game is by definition something the GM has at LEAST thought "of", or it wouldn't be there (Unless you're playing some game with strong player narrative control, in which case the players CAN be expected to narratively control themselves out of any situation they narratively controlled themselves into).  <br/><br/>The fact that the GM should also have to think OUT the situations that the PCs encounter is, to me, a sort of minimum viable criteria, lest the game descend into some sort of reflex driven incoherence ("Uh...and then...NINJAS!").   And yes, this is a small amount of work, which is why it's important that "rules" for safeguarding this stuff be as quick and easy as possible.  (It doesn't get much easier than "think of A solution" because if you can't, you've already triggered the warning condition.)<br/><br/>I don't think you can absolve yourself of responsibility for the world by saying "hey, it's a sandbox";  You're still responsible for what's in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443149/#Comment_443149" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-23T22:11:42+00:00" title="February 23, 2015 10:11PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you then say that a GM using a random encounter table they did not make themselves is responsible for a complex outcome of that table? How about a GM who acknowledges the slim chance of an extraordinary event, assigns it a probability in the low percentages and then rolls to discover whether it occurs?<br/><br/>How about a GM who references a source considered authoritative for the campaign setting, and discovers detail they would not have chosen themselves?<br/><br/>I think that interpreting everything that goes on in the game as an ultimate responsibility of the GM is somewhat unrealistic, and above all destructive towards the kind of neutral refereeing that certain sorts of sandbox games strive for as a creative strategy. It might be correct on some sort of strictly theoretical epistemological level - like jury nullification is theoretically possible - but it is an useless observation in practice if your game is specifically construed around constructive denial of GM responsibility.<br/><br/>It'd be like if we insisted that an auteur GM of a railroaded story game can't truly be the master of their table because the other players always have the option of walking out on him; strictly speaking this is true, but insofar as the creative scheme of the game in question goes, it is irrelevant, and focusing on it may at most be harmful as it draws attention to the implicit power players hold in an arrangement that is intended to maximize the power disparity. Claiming that an auteur GM can't "really" be all-powerful is like claiming that a sandbox referee can't "really" be impartial - they both certainly can get close enough as to make no practical difference for players who want to join in and support the scheme.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443156/#Comment_443156" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T00:53:21+00:00" title="February 24, 2015 12:53AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2015 12:54AM by Airk.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really agree, and I think it's pretty simple. The GM is not bound by the rules of that chart or that book that someone else wrote.  In a traditional GM-and-players game, the only thing that enters the game that is not introduced by the GM is the actions of the player characters.  Is there a monster there? It's not there because a table says so, it's there because the GM looked at the table and decided that result is an acceptable thing to have in the game.  If you rolled on a table with one blatantly out-of-theme option ("Kilrathi infiltrators with ray guns!") you are not suddenly required to transform your game into Sci-fi.<br/><br/>The GM is essentially the sole arbiter of all content that enters the game.   He can strive for neutrality if he wants, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility for the elements he introduces.  If he hits someone's emotional trigger, it's on him, even if he rolled it on a chart.  The same goes for all the content in the game.  The reasons for introducing it or choosing not to will vary, but the GM is always exercising his or her judgement, and is, ultimately,  the most responsible party in terms of ensuring everyone in the game has a good time.  <br/><br/>Also, to be completely frank, I don't see any connection between "This is a sandbox game" and "The random monster table is sacrosanct" but that's probably just a difference in definition again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443158/#Comment_443158" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T03:32:54+00:00" title="February 24, 2015  3:32AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's not confuse responsibility at the social contract level with those duties demanded of an old-school DM at the level of gameplay roles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443159/#Comment_443159" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T04:08:14+00:00" title="February 24, 2015  4:08AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not.

If they introduce something that's bad for the game, it's their fault.  The "game world" does not exist, except as created by the GM. Fullstop.  If something is offensive in the game world, it's not "because it's in a book" it's because the GM included it.  If something is jarring in the game world, it's not "because it's in a book" it's because the GM included it.  If something in the game world ruins someone's fun, it's not "because of that table" it's because the GM included it.<br/><br/>All content, wonderful, annoying, terrifying, trigger inducing, or warm and fuzzy, enters the game through the GM.  It is their responsibility.  They can't abdicate that and say "But the sourcebook says...." for things that ruin someone's fun anymore than they can abdicate responsibility for any of the other things.<br/><br/>I think the GM, even in an "oldschool game" still needs to curate the content in some fashion.

Who chose to use the table? Who decided not to fudge the results of the roll, even if it would "ruin someone's fun"?

But it's hard to go against the prep because fidelity to the prep is what I value most highly about the the game.<br/>It's like:<br/>1. The gaming table being a safe environment<br/>2. Everyone at the table having a say, no "DM cult".<br/>3. Fidelity to the prep and the "pocket universe" -- Right to Dream<br/>4. Interesting choices, events and bangs -- Story Now<br/>5. Diegetic challenges and puzzles -- Step On Up<br/><br/>A lot of the worst arguments I've had with my group has been me defending the Step On Up agenda ("Do you really want to start at level three? Wouldn't that feel like cheating?"), but I'll value interesting behaviour ("flashlight dropping") over it, and I'll value fidelity to the pocket universe over that, and only after <em>that</em> will I step in and "change" what's been going on.<br/>It takes a lot of me to override the DM of the "then" and it always bums me out.<br/>The DM of the "then" (and the module designers) are so kind to me and leave so many blank spaces already and put in so many interesting things.

I dunno about your game, but I used to espouse the same priority, and it was severely incomplete.  Our world wasn't constructed as an experiment, and there was no continuous process of generating meaningful takeaways about it.  We didn't really find out much about <i>the world</i> after all; we found out about these particular characters engaged in these specific actions in this specific <i>part</i> of the world.  Yeah, it did feed back into a larger sense of the world being real and continuous, and I value and prioritize that to this day.  But it was never enough; whenever the characters had nothing to do put poke at the world, the players got bored.  And honestly, engaging in time-consuming combats is probably the least efficient way to answer "what would happen in this world" questions that I could possibly imagine.  If it's a socially interesting world, the characters should be politicking; if it's a physically interesting world, they should be exploring and surveying and mining; if it's a magically interesting world, they should all be wizards in training.<br/><br/>In the end, what got people excited was <i>using</i> this world <i>as a challenge arena</i>.  Poking at the world was most fun when it unlocked some new capability or provided a clue for some mission.<br/><br/>Accordingly, although world logic had to remain impervious, "world steward" was far from the entirety of my job as GM.  Interesting diegetic challenges were also an absolute must.  Not <i>necessarily</i> tactically interesting (though that was a plus!) -- but at least interactive and goal-oriented enough to keep the players charged and moving.<br/><br/>No idea if this applies to your game.  Maybe your players are better at taking a truly indifferent world and investing in activities within it.  Mine weren't so good at that, so I had to make my world far from indifferent -- it's pretty much packed with well-built and well-labeled challenge opportunities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443218/#Comment_443218" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-24T22:26:05+00:00" title="February 24, 2015 10:26PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2015 10:30PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>So for me, improving my fiction-based challenge GMing has been about training good habits to use unconsciously, rather than consciously making good GM decisions based on any explicit schema.

That's not what I mean to put there!" moment, it stays during play?  Even if it's not what you intended during prep?  Even if it doesn't make any sense in the world?</blockquote>You appear to have skipped my last sentence.  Explicit stuff for bailout options = GM tools to deal with nonsense, mistakes, and unforeseen edge cases.  <br/><br/>The point isn't that the consciously authorial GM brain <i>never</i> kicks in; it's that it kicks in only when it <i>has</i> to.  The rest of the time, the GM gets to join the players in living the illusion.

I've told this story before, how after 20 years of wonky and unsatisfying roleplaying, that three years ago I played in Barrowmaze and there was this magic item and the way it was placed and ran felt so "real". The dungeon felt like a living system we could change and interact with at our leisure. I'm still amazed when cool sim moments happen, like random encounter rolls that make perfect story sense.<br/><br/>I'm also heavily into rolling everything open, showing the "gears" to the players a lot, because I am so stoked about the notion that this world <em>is</em> running as a "system", that it's the opposite of the "no myth"-game play I played for decades.\n<blockquote>In the end, what got people excited was <i>using</i> this world <i>as a challenge arena</i>.  Poking at the world was most fun when it unlocked some new capability or provided a clue for some mission.<br/><br/>Accordingly, although world logic had to remain impervious, "world steward" was far from the entirety of my job as GM.  Interesting diegetic challenges were also an absolute must.  Not <i>necessarily</i> tactically interesting (though that was a plus!) -- but at least interactive and goal-oriented enough to keep the players charged and moving.<br/><br/>No idea if this applies to your game.  Maybe your players are better at taking a truly indifferent world and investing in activities within it.  Mine weren't so good at that, so I had to make my world far from indifferent -- it's pretty much packed with well-built and well-labeled challenge opportunities.</blockquote>\nMy world isn't indifferent either! So far, The Lost City and The Caverns of Thracia have been placed about a day's travel from the player's city... where they are criminals who have taken over an abandoned dungeon.\n<blockquote>The point isn't that the consciously authorial GM brain <i>never</i> kicks in; it's that it kicks in only when it <i>has</i> to.  The rest of the time, the GM gets to join the players in living the illusion.  Most GMs who are motivated to run this kind of game want some of that type of fun too.</blockquote>\nPerfectly put.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443236/#Comment_443236" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T10:42:35+00:00" title="February 25, 2015 10:42AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So even if you discover some ridiculous edge case that makes no sense that  you missed during prep, or you have a total "Oh crap!

It's all done beforehand!" <br/><br/>So it seems like we've cycled through a circle of excuses for just not taking responsibility for the stuff you put into your game, whether you do so beforehand ("In prep") or on the fly. <br/><br/>I don't have any specific examples of crazy edge cases, because I don't play games that use tons of tables and have weird edge cases, and even if I did, I'd immediately just think "That makes no sense." and move on because I have no sanctity of prep in my mind.  What I have written down is no more definitive than what's in my head at the moment I say something.  The only time something becomes canon is when it happens in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443253/#Comment_443253" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T19:43:38+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  7:43PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I do:<br/><br/>In prep, I do pay some attention to the difficulty level of things. That is, I make sure there is enough low-level adventure locations available that I don't have to worry about the rest, which do tend to be low-level also, but might not be. An occasional deathtrap or whatever would be okay, but I rarely see those in published adventures and rarely have the occasion to make them myself.<br/><br/>Also in prep, I don't read the tables I use through, but rather skim them a bit to see if they are interesting at all. So, whenever the player characters encounter something in the deep underworld, it might be that I roll a Dungeon world monster and it might turn out to be the apocalypse dragon. Or it might as well be a bunch of kobolds from Basic fantasy rpg, if the dungeon level is small (as BFrpg has different tables for different dungeon levels).<br/><br/>In play, I follow the prep and random rolls faithfully. If the result of a random roll is utterly impossible (a quarry or other fixed location where none was just before, or a monster that does not fit inside the location at all) and I don't figure out a way of including it within a few seconds, I reroll; this has happened maybe once or twice and I have refereed a fair number of sessions. I may or may not tell the players what the impossible event that I decided to reroll was, depending on pacing etc. I tell if they ask.<br/><br/>The necessity for following prep and dice is that otherwise I would be tempted to steer the course of play; for example, to make player characters survive. And if I were doing that, than it would not be the players who are responsible for the fates of their characters. Their successes would be worth less, and their failures my responsibility. This would remove the point of play.<br/><br/>For example: A bunch of 1st level D&amp;D characters. Encounter is a storm giant and 2 chimera. Reaction roll indicates they are not overtly hostile, but not too friendly, either. They are encountered near the Death frost doom mountain. Quick improvisation: the giant demands the puny mortals to find its ancestor inside the mountain, or it would let the chimera feed.<br/><br/>I had no idea this would happen. If the reaction roll would have been different, then the giant would have slain the scout and others might or might not have escaped. If the giant would have been hostile and the party would not have had a scout and surprise rolls had indicated that the giant or the chimera notice the party, then everyone would almost surely have died. Not quite a deathtrap, but an acceptable situation.<br/><br/>Grinding gear contains pretty much a death trap. LotFP adventure with crystal heads contains such a combinatorial explosion of possible outcomes that I have no idea what would happen if characters entered it. It is a deathtrap in some situations, there is the possibility to start building an entirely obedient army or to have everything with tens of kilometers destroyed due to an alien invasion, or an outcome that would likely lead to technological collapse within the entire civilised world. There is probably more and I might misremember things. Both of these adventures are within the sandbox and they might trigger during any session now.<br/><br/>Given this sort of sandbox, what could possibly be a ridiculous edge case? I'm asking because I can't really envision such. This is an honest question, not an attempt to bait you into an argument or to say gotcha.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443255/#Comment_443255" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T19:50:50+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  7:50PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2015 7:58PM by Airk.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Given this sort of sandbox, what could possibly be a ridiculous edge case?"<br/><br/>Quarry in the swamp? :P<br/><br/>"Oops this table told me to roll on another table which has a small chance of giving an aquatic creature"?<br/><br/>Etc.

It's not my fault!" is a valid excuse for anything which ruins a game or causes personal trouble at the social level. <br/><br/>But having something come up that you haven't thought through, like a storm giant appearing on a random encounter in a scenario where everything is wet, and a single lightning bolt could electrocute all the characters on level 5? That can certainly come up - a "problem without known solutions".<br/><br/>Let's not confuse these two things, please!<br/><br/>The latter is 100% correct play in some games (particularly stochastic dungeon/adventure sandbox-type games, where they are a huge part of the fun), but not well-suited to others.

It is difficult, dangerous, and potentially lethal, but there are clearly things the players can do to maintain agency and increase and decrease their chances.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443288/#Comment_443288" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T02:14:11+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:14AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 2:15AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Airk, I think this conversation is rambling all over, and includes many different viewpoints, so if you attempt to parse it as a unified response to your specific point, of course you're going to be frustrated.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, most of us agree with your principle that the GM ought to make sure that none of the situation ingredients the GM introduces into play (by whatever means) wind up breaking the game.  Here's the thing, though -- different games have different criteria for what breaks them, and different GMs engage failsafes at different stages of the process.<br/><br/>I agree that "GM ruining the game and dodging responsibility" is a thing that can happen, but I don't see anyone here advocating that; rather, I simply see people solving that problem in ways that wouldn't work <i>for me</i> and my game.  It doesn't mean they're wrong!  It just means they're more tolerant of randomness, or making new characters, or retcons, or other things that aren't my taste.<br/><br/>The GM does <i>not</i> have any responsibility to avoid outcomes that all participants are cool with, and I'm not gonna assume "That event must have sucked for your players!" unless someone tells me so.  If you start a thread about "what situations broke the game when you were GMing?", <i>then</i> you might find some opportunities to point out, "You could have avoided that with a little bit of advance trouble-shooting!"  But I think your odds are pretty low in a meandering thread like this one -- your point has been made, and I think it's a good one, but it's not going to apply to a lot of what's being discussed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443289/#Comment_443289" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T02:22:30+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:22AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 Dave!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443290/#Comment_443290" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T02:32:32+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:32AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I played in Barrowmaze and there was this magic item and the way it was placed and ran felt so "real".

I've had some very realistic scenes of not much going on, and they had a pretty short span of "this is still fun" -- basically, once the players realized there was nothing consequential for them to do, the fun stopped.  <br/><br/>So, "meaningful" -- I've usually gotten this via some sort of mission ethos, implied or explicit challenges, goals, puzzles, etc. ... but yeah, there are infinite other options, like anything that hooks into what the characters care about, or who they are, or how they get along, or what they're going through right now.  <br/><br/>I also think there's something that feels meaningful about carving your notch in the history of a place that feels real -- simply deposing a mayor and getting him replaced is very rewarding, regardless of character goals, because, "Look, Hub Town has a new mayor now and <i>we did that</i>."  (This effect is especially strong if (a) a record is logged somewhere in the real world, and (b) future sessions bring groups -- familiar or otherwise! -- to Hub Town.)<br/><br/>FWIW, be aware that throwing the "Sim" label at any of this stuff may provoke arguments, as there's no consensus that this is what it actually means.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443304/#Comment_443304" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T08:15:40+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  8:15AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Etc.

Consider the giant with chimera; the encounter was entirely unplanned and did not make any sense (a priori). Furthermore, it was utterly imbalanced by any reasonable measure.

Ideally, and I have never seen this ideal <i>fully</i> realized, all the "material" is done before hand, and all the "situations" arise organically.<br/>So you're right, there are a few opportunties to spot check. If there is arachnophobia around the table, don't put spiders "in the material". If there are issues with a situation or behavior, alter or retcon the narrative in play (which is painful, because it's counter to the agenda).<br/>"Unwinnable" situations might, or might not, be cause for that.<br/>However, figuring out beforehand if a situation is unwinnable or not is very much counter to the agenda.
