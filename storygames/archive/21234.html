Rolling a d20 + modifiers vs. a DC feels very different from rolling a dice pool of d6s and counting successes. A d100 system always "feels" gritty and grimy and realistic even if it's not. All of these things could have similar probabilities and outcomes, yet the mechanics (especially those communicated by the character sheet to the players) would create a "feel" for the game that transcends the mechanics.<br/><br/>Surely I am not the only one who senses this mystery...?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465237/#Comment_465237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T16:31:22+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  4:31PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, mechanics definitely have a feel, but no two people, even in the same group of players actually relates the exact same things to a particular mechanic. I played for years using the storyteller engine, d20, a d% and 2d6. <br/><br/>Dice pools felt slower and even a bit immersion breaking for me, specially if I had to add all the results instead of comparing them. That is unless I refrained myself from trying to interpret them and let the work to whoever in the group was better at it.<br/><br/>d% didn't help when as a GM you wanted to establish that an NPC was competent, it took me years to realize that how you read the dice is what determines competence or not. But then d100 + bonuses was completely the opposite making us feel easily how the game went into anime-like over the head action.<br/><br/>So "gritty" "grimy" and "realistic" are actually feels you can attach to any kind of dice if you are <i>convinced</i> that they must work some way and are able to describe it as well.<br/>That emphasis in <i>convinced</i> is because if you can't see a d100 as something "realistic" your subconscious will rebel against describing it otherwise. And the longer a group is exposed to any kind of intense experience that they can relate to a mechanic, the more ingrained that "feeling" is in them. The mechanic becomes a <i>symbol</i> able to evoke those feelings in you. <br/><br/>You will notice it in how your whole mentality changes the moment you see a d20 appear in an unexpected context, and how different one type of dice seem from another. They are both dice, pieces of plastic. A person who hasn't played any game with them won't have feelings attached to them. Though the curiosity the dice inspire for the kind of game they are used for is certainly universal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465239/#Comment_465239" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T17:02:58+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  5:02PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk has outlined it pretty nicely, I think!

Properly calculated game mechanics are used everywhere to emphasize how hard or easy is to get something done in a game. All dice mechanics though, need to be triggered with the appropriate timing to get their message through. <br/><br/>If as a GM in VtM you asked often for dice rolls, players would end up getting the idea that their characters are less competent than they would expect for a 50, or 150 year old vampire. Specially if you used the old mechanic that 1's cancel 10's that actually made characters with bigger pools mathematically less effective than characters with smaller pools. If you compared dice pools instead -as the game stated on the GMing advice pages- players would actually feel their characters more competent. Talking from experience here btw.<br/><br/>It's a similar case for D&amp;D when you compare the Old school approach to the game to 3.5 or Pathfinder. In old school you need to play way more carefully as the dice math is most of the time against you. You are better being careful, planning ahead and being clear in how exactly you do anything, so you don't trigger the dice rolling resolution. In 3.5 or PF if players powergame, they may end up breaking the math in a way that it would be the GM the one trying to avoid letting the players roll the dice! <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/>So, while yes, math do adds a specific game experience, how much and how well it gets implemented influences a lot the feelings each player attaches to a specific dice mechanic.  It's a mix of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
