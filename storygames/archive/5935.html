If it serves any purpose at all right now, it's as an archive of some of the best posts I've seen on practical matters of play in a long time (from my perspective).  <br/><br/>But in reality, if anything, it's likely a distraction from other sites that are more active and more engaged in work right now - places like Story-Games, The Forge, and others.  So, I'm going to go through it, and copy out what I see as the "golden" stuff.  Which I will archive for myself, likely on the CogWars site.<br/><br/>Others wanting to go through the site and dig for gold?  Now is the time.  Anyone who does not want to have any of their stuff tossed into an archive?  Say so."</b></i><br/><br/>If anyone has any threads they want to transplant over here for archiving (or further discussion even, if you think it warrants it), start digging and posting. Most of it is great, solid thought.<br/><br/><a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/index.php</a><br/><br/>Levi's site was a grand idea, and helped me realize that I wanted to focus on the the same thing with the creation of S-G (namely the Gaming +/Play Advice category).<br/><br/>No need to rummage for anything just for the sake of busywork archiving. I'm just saying that if there's a thread or two over there that really hit you in a significant way, think about recreating it (copy-pasting, quoting people in kind) over here in a new thread.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
