                    In the thread about game length, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=298&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">Ben says</a> that Polaris is short with regard to characters, but that the game itself is not bound by that restriction - <i>"Characters have endgames, players don't."</i><br/><br/>Which is interesting, because I never would have thought to keep going after the characters died.<br/><br/>In the classic open-ended game it is usually assumed that characters will need to be replaced during the course of the game, and so the practice of bringing in new characters is already integrated into the game's culture (usually much more so then it's mechanics), often to comic effect ("another one tied to the wall in a dungeon with his equipment convenniently nearby? How many does this make now? Oh, well, bring him along"). In shorter games' culture this is only sparsely addressed. <br/><br/>If I were to die in my quest to kill the Witch, it would never occur to me to roll up a new Ronin and keep going. I have failed, and will accept my honorable death.<br/><br/>When do we feel that it's right to just replace our characters and keep going, and when is the character intimately tied into the game in such a way that the end of it's role, whether by death, resolving it's issues, it's theme finishing it's part or any other method, signals the end of the game?<br/><br/>And the standard follow-up question - "how can we take this apart?"                </div>

                            God, I have to be one of those posers who chimes in with, "Well in MY game", when 'my game' isn't even on the shelf yet (but will be later this year, inshallah). But in the ghost killers (kind of an intense action-horror game) I figure player death is going to be somewhat regular: Like once every two or three sessions.<br/><br/>So to do that, I had to take it apart in the following ways:<br/><br/>1) After character "death", they can still be retreivable.  That char's player decides if the character is "Dead", or "Dead-Dead".  If "Dead", then the other PCs have to go on a quest to "get them back", while they at the same time have to actively escape their bonds.  Common situation would be where they lose all their "hit points" fighting a demon... Player says "I just want to be Dead", so the demon "drags the player to hell". If he wanted to be Dead-Dead, then the demon would have torn him apart, etc.<br/><br/>The Dead-Quest gets its own rules, etc, and can be started even in the middle of the current scenario.<br/><br/>2) To not make it too cheesy and out-of-genre, though, the player can decide to be Dead-Dead.  If they go that path, the group gets a modest bonus to compensate, and that character will never come back. So that there's some real gain in character death.<br/><br/>3) To top that off, I've made chargen so that it takes less than 5 minutes to make a new, interesting character. That HAD to happen to make char death acceptable. In Conan OGL, it took our group of 4 players with 2 copies of the book 4 hours to make a character. We had 4 Conan types that RAN AWAY FROM COMBAT for fear of dying and having to go through that fucking mess again.<br/><br/>4) The only thing that I have yet to think about is ways to encourage players (through the game's text, examples, or failing that, <i>rules</i>) to let go. To make a rich, interesting character but then have it totally acceptable to lose them every now and then. Kinda like LOST. I think the modest team bonus, plus fast chargen, will help that out rule-wise, but I need to hammer it in to folks' heads.<br/><br/>5) The last thing is that I'm thinking that if a character dies, that they get to set stakes and roll dice on behalf of the GM, to keep them involved and turn up the heat on their team.<br/><br/>Anyway, as you said, if you want folks to let go, the rules and text have to back that up.<br/><br/>There's not many games that do that.  However, in Weapons of the Gods there's a rule that works for both baddies and protags: There are like 5-7 wound levels. If you progress through the ranks, it means that you're "in it for the long haul" in combat, and when you die it's because you chose to stick it out and not run away, so the player is "ready" for it.  However, if the protag or antag goes from wound levels 1-4 straight to "dead" from a lucky roll of the dice or because they were outmatched, then they have the option of "being left for dead".  I think I'm gonna steal a version of this rule as well.<br/><br/>It fits the genre, and also compensates for when someone's not ready to let go. But to my knowledge, not a lot of other games really have it worked out that well when a character dies. It's expected that they roll up a new guy next session (or that session) and twiddle their thumbs while the GM finds a way to stick them in.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            "I figure player death is going to be somewhat regular: Like once every two or three sessions."<br/><br/>Now <em>that's</em> hard core, Kitkowski!  Does the GM do the killing?  Who is in charge of disposing of the corpses?  You'd need to cover the floor with a tarp to keep from staining the carpet.  Talk about commitment to the game.                        </div>

<p>Nah, you just get soda water at CostCo.  A gallon or two will deal with any blood-stain ever created.  It's true!</p>

                            HAH, I was even going to slip in a joke about "If there's PLAYER death, though, then the game should come to a pause for at least one session", but I didn't even notice that I unconsciously already slipped that in.<br/><br/>Want to playtest? We're going to play out in the mountains, near the tar pits. And we're only taking one car...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<i>"The last thing is that I'm thinking that if a character dies, that they get to set stakes and roll dice on behalf of the GM, to keep them involved and turn up the heat on their team."</i><br/><br/>How about "the last player to lose a character is the new GM, and stays that way until the next character dies".<br/><br/>It won't work for most setups, obviously, but maybe in one of those games where narration and guidance switch between the players anyway...                        </div>

<p>I've got a game where each character has a clock counting down to the end of his time as an entity engaging in conflicts. When his time runs out, his story is over, and depending on how great he was, the world might change to remember him.</p>
