It's a murder mystery game, set in 1930s England.<br/><br/>At the end of the book, I'm going to have recipes. I believe, fairly firmly, that understanding food is a pretty good way of understanding a culture. So, there are recipes for roast beef with yorkshire pudding, shepherd's pie and so forth. There are also instructions for making a cup of tea.<br/><br/>However, I'd like to have recipes that people will actually cook. With that in mind, which recipes would you like to hear about?<br/><br/>Here's a bit of guidance. One thing I could write about is Hot Desserts. These, in the form of a pudding, are a very British thing. There are things like Bread And Butter Pudding, which is the most astonishing dessert: it's a leftovers dish, made from stale bread and butter, milk and sugar. The astonishing thing is that it's delicious.<br/><br/>I could also write about Indian-derived foods. British food used to be surprisingly spicy: we lost much of that, during the war, when rationing came in and making do with poorer food became a virtue. In the 1930s, though, we've got chutneys, kedgeree and lots of British interpretations (or bastardisations) of Indian dishes.<br/><br/>And then there are thrifty dishes. It was traditional to make a joint of meat last three days: it would be roasted for Sunday dinner; made into cold meats for luncheon; then be incorporated into various leftovers dishes. The bones would be boiled to make soup. Actually, I could definitely write about soup.<br/><br/>And there's also a particular spice/herb combination that's distinctively English. I could write about how to use spices and herbs in that distinctive way.<br/><br/>What sort of thing should I write about? What would you cook or like to hear about? Thanks for any ideas you can provide.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250279/#Comment_250279" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-11T04:00:46+00:00" title="January 11, 2010  4:00AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2010 4:10AM by Neil.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've got to have a recipe for Spotted Dick, just for the 'fnarr fnarr' value.

Milk in first or tea in first.<br/><br/>What's fascinating is that this becomes a class issue. You will find people who argue, vehemently, that putting the milk in first is an upper-class habit. Similarly, you will find people that argue that putting the tea in first is a sign of good breeding. There's some justification for the latter: it used to be the the case that only porcelain could take hot tea being poured directly on it. Poorer china would crack, so you put the milk in first, so that the tea was at a lower temperature.<br/><br/>This is what I like about food discussions. They implicitly reflect economic and class issues. Passing the port is the other classic one: there are lots of rules about how you should pass the port, after a meal. Everyone agrees you should pass the port to the left (that is, to port). However, there are then various traditions: one says the port must never <i>leave</i> the table as it passes around; another says that it should never <i>rest on</i> the table. <br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250425/#Comment_250425" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-12T04:40:38+00:00" title="January 12, 2010  4:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2010 4:41AM by Graham.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>Ah, so the chicken curry on the breakfast buffet in Dorothy Sayers book wasn't necessarily super mild as I had assumed.

I'm not sure when English food stopped using herbs and spices: after all, the herbs grow wild, so it's no trouble to use them.<br/><br/>I <i>imagine</i> it was during the war, when "making do" with poorer food became a virtue.

Lunch today was leftovers from the weekend's roast lamb, served with the rather excellent <a href="http://www.ottervaleproducts.co.uk/devon-fire-chutney.htm" rel="nofollow">Devon Fire chutney</a>.  And you ought to mention piccalilli.

What spices were common, what spices were most appreciated, how were they used, what dishes were they used in?<br/>2.) Little culinary rules (like MIF-TIF and port-passing etiquette), which are revealing of both culinary customs and the social environment.<br/>3.) Dishes that were typical and mood-evoking (hot desserts, trifle, yorkshire pudding... all good).<br/><br/>Was it common for upstanding Brits to prepare their own chutneys, or did they come from a can, produced by some exotick Other?<br/>If so, a chutney recipe.<br/>If not, a note explaining that your maid should just buy chutney from the market, because upstanding Brits don't actually make it themselves.<br/><br/>I'd want to be scouring through that section and not only find a compact selection of era-appropriate recipes, but also elegant expressions of cultural priorities and identity.<br/>Because if the latter was included, I could serve anything for dinner and still feel immersed in the "right atmosphere", so long as I was turning up my nose over how others poured their tea, or which spoon they used first*.<br/><br/>*Rules about cutlery and table setting?

Were those important?</blockquote>\nOh, man, I could talk about this all day. Yes, definitely. There were different sorts of cutlery: a fish knife was significantly different from a steak knife; a soup spoon was not a dessert spoon. Using the wrong fork or spoon was an indicator of low class. People would laugh at you behind your back for it.<br/><br/>The rule was (and is) to work from the outside. Use the cutlery on the outside of your place setting to eat the first course. Then, the table is cleared, use the next set in to eat the next course. This, of course, meant the servants needed to lay places exactly. They had to know what every piece of cutlery was.<br/><br/>The impetus behind chutneys was more technological. In the 1930s, British country houses still didn't have refrigerators: they had larders, pantries and perhaps ice rooms, instead. So you couldn't keep fruit and vegetables. Instead, you made them into chutneys, pickles and preserves.<br/><br/>You didn't do it yourself, of course. You got the housekeeper to do it. (Note how the cooking was divided on gender lines. Baking, chutneys and pickles was done by the housekeeper; formal, showy dinners were done by the chef.)<br/><br/>Chutneys are <i>easy</i> and rather fun to make.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250596/#Comment_250596" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-13T05:10:43+00:00" title="January 13, 2010  5:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm writing this now.

Cold milk proteins like tannins. In other words, if your tea is strong and very bitter, pouring it into cold milk will reduce the bitterness significantly. The proteins stretch with the heat and entangle the tannins, changing their shape (and flavour). Bitterness goes away, but the strength of the tea flavour persists.<br/><br/>However, if you put milk into hot tea, the proteins are cooked before they have time to mix with the tannins. Tea remains bitter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251923/#Comment_251923" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T16:35:37+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  4:35PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posh git.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251924/#Comment_251924" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T16:36:34+00:00" title="January 21, 2010  4:36PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Selene Tan</cite>A quick note about measurements: flour in the US is usually measured by volume.
