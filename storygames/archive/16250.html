I've been here a long time, but I went by "Alvin Frewer" to pretend it was a real, civilized name, and then "Pulp Poet" because I'd long since stopped using Alvin. Jogesh is my name. It's my Hindu name that I was given last year.<br/><br/>I avoided the first thread because I didn't want a blend of real life and Internet life. But I'm cautiously lowering those walls somewhat.<br/><br/>I work as a game designer for a video game company. It's pretty cool. I don't talk about it much.<br/><br/>I live in California. I've got an awesome wife. I have two peculiar cats.<br/><br/>I've got a <a href="http://www.pulppoetry.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a> for my writing. I'm increasingly proud of it. It started off as a place for fiction writing and poetry. It has expanded into anything that will expand my mind (including fiction and poetry), and trying to unearth that technology and tell stories about it to others.<br/><br/>I want to see games teach us to see life as fun, and to help create stronger personal awareness. My personal mission is to leave the world better than when I entered it. Like Mcdaldno, I consider myself a radical. I've never found a movement either, so I've recently had to face the fact that there just isn't one.

I work in IT and before that have had a billion different types of odd jobs like farm laborer, handyman, Christmas tree trimmer, donut fryer, McDonald's burgerbuilder, and legal researcher. But I love being a helpdesk guy who fixes computers in a way I never thought I'd feel about a job. I like helping people, I like fixing things, and I like taking things apart and putting them back together. Before I got into IT I thought about how I should have been an auto mechanic. But I don't know anything about cars.<br/><br/>I have been game-obsessed all my life. I sometimes question it, like am I going to lay on my deathbed and think, "Man, that one session of Primetime Adventures was awesome," and then expire? Is that how I went it to be? But when I decided to move to New York City, one of the biggest reasons was so that I would have an easier time finding people to game with. I'm in three weekly games now and love it. And if that seems like a lot, I spend even more time than that playing video games. But somehow I also find time to exercise and learn to cook and have a cool girlfriend and go to horror movie conventions and things like that.<br/><br/>Oh, I love horror movies. I love all horror movies. Even the extreme ones that make people upset, the "torture porn" stuff. I watched them a lot when I was a kid, and then forgot about them until the end of college when someone was like, "Bret, you know more about horror movies than anyone I know." And I sort of remembered that I loved them and rekindled that.<br/><br/>I like to draw too but I'm terrible at it. I spent a couple years drawing really, really bad webcomics and I miss it but I have a hard time squeezing it in.<br/><br/>I designed a game called The Final Girl. I have a game that I'm done designing but not done with all the bookmaking stuff that comes after that called Cold Soldier. It won a Ronnie. Toot toot. After that I have some more things I want to make. I'm codesigning a game about gonzo journalism and grindhouse films with a friend, and designing a game for my girlfriend about astronauts. She's going to do the art because she's way better at drawing than she thinks she is.<br/><br/>My grandma is my hero. My favorite food is chicken shawarma. I'm a guilty ex-vegetarian. And a Pisces. Also I used to internet overshare but haven't done much of that lately. Turns out it's like riding a bike.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts" title="DorkThoughts"><img alt="DorkThoughts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DorkThoughts">DorkThoughts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371174/#Comment_371174" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T10:28:48+00:00" title="April  4, 2012 10:28AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2013 2:50PM by DorkThoughts.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Noam.

I fling myself out of planes on occasion and scale precipitous rockfaces too (if I'm not plummeting headlong down them on my downhill MTB).<br/><br/>I love the outdoors, camping and just getting out in the bush, but indulge in the odd bit of world wide tramping too (when I can afford it!).  Food is a passion, and the fine art of creating it is a constant joy, as is sharing with my friends and family. I spend an inordinate amount of my spare time making stuff for games. Maps, adventures, characters, rules and hacks. Its an obsession, but I love it. I've been roleplaying with my brothers and my nephew a little, but they live so far away, as do my old crew of gamers in the Blue Mts.

I honestly haven't counted what I have but it has to be 6000+ of these (prob more)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) RPG magazines/zine.. mags like Dragon, , A&amp;E's, zines from the UK like "The Beholder".. as long as it was printed and has RPG content in it I collect it.. prob have one of the best collection of the planet for this;) something like 4000+ individualy issues.. and still looking for the ones I'm missing..<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Aussie made RPG's.. I've collected a lot of the rpg's the were made in Australia.. still after a couple of older ones.. IF YOU ARE AUSTRALIAN AND ARE PRINTING A RPG GAME LET ME KNOW!!<br/>\n<br/>\n4) RPG Cover paintings.. Covers of TSR modules.. 1st-2nd edion stuff.. from artists like Easley, Caldwell.. etc.. no elmores yet..

I am <a href="http://instituteparachute.ca/adam" rel="nofollow">an artist</a> and am lately working mostly in performance and video, involving music and games. Lots of challenge, game sensibilities juxtaposed against 70s style endurance performance and ambivalence about the roles of the artist and of documentation.</p>\n<p>I've run weekly games of <a href="http://manhunt-edmonton.com" rel="nofollow">hide and seek in the city I live</a> in for several years, as well as creating games that were more clearly parts of my art practice. I ended up reading a lot of theory in the last couple of years, online and in books, and am really interested in the problematic narrative of the GM as author vs players as active agents which has caused so much strife in the RPG world, in relationship to my own role as a politically active artist and the dilemma of artist-as-educator. I love following big aesthetic arguments like that.</p>\n<p>Last year I attended a group residency in the mountains at Banff, hosted by some Icelandic artists, that was all about romance and the landscape and the absurdity of performance\u2014to go along with the theme of going up The Magic Mountain, I suggested in my proposal that I would run an OSR D&amp;D game in the studio. I haven't stopped since.</p>\n<p>Games are part of my artistic practice but most of them are better off if you don't start arguing about whether they are art or not so don't worry (I hate those arguments too much).

Oddly, I wasn't anything interesting until I was an ex-husband.<br/><br/>I have never acted in a porn film, but I am a fan of several actresses (including one who opened her own store in San Francisco and another who had a club in my home town) and am on a first-name basis with strippers, all of whom know more about superhero comics than me.<br/><br/>I write games and give them away for free because, honestly, that's all I've been able to afford.<br/><br/>(And my current roleplaying group includes players who consider themselves Fear Itself and the AntiChrist. Not sure what to make of that.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379088/#Comment_379088" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T05:54:09+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  5:54AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Tazio, mercenary illustrator, comic artist and graphic designer hailing from Padova (which the barbarians of the north call Padua), the cultural heart of the Serenissima Republic of Venice, now part of the Italian Republic and Europe.<br/>Before that I used to live in Japan for several years working in the comic industry. I speak five languages to various degrees, and I still like to delude myself by dressing the clothes of the sophisticate linguist.<br/><br/>I haven't roleplayed in ages and I'm struggling to finish my RPG project about which people are tired of hearing me talk. It's called Beyond the Mirror. Here, some <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thechiseledgear/beyond-the-mirror" rel="nofollow">shameless self-advertising</a>.<br/>I'm a voracious reader, mainly of science fiction and cyberpunk.

I'm Dylan Nix, and I'm terrible at introductions. I've taken my best shot at distilling the essential elements of myself to give the most accurate snapshot possible, however inaccurate that might actually be.<br/> <br/>I'm 25 years old, married to a wonderful lady who is (in no particular order) a geek, a fierce programmer, an amateur gardener, a visual designer, and a Settlers of Catan tournament player. I'm a technical writer by day, and I'm trying my hand at game design in my spare time. I live in the USofA; I used to live in Louisiana (Shreveport, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans), but now I live in California (Santa Clara and Sunnyvale).  <br/><br/>I enjoy:\n<ul><li>games of all kinds</li>\n<li>the works of Jim Henson</li>\n<li>peanut butter, tasty bread, strong coffee, and very spicy food</li>\n<li>good music</li>\n<li>and the comedy of the Marx Brothers, Gary Larson, A Bit of Fry and Laurie, and Everything Is Terrible!</li></ul>\n<br/>I'm hoping to find some folks to play some of these highly praised story games so I can join in on the good conversations here.  I'm not completely without experience, I just have far fewer games played than I would like to have.

I love most stereotypical geek things, plus gardening, cooking and travel.<br/><br/>I've been a roleplayer for over two decades, and have played and/or run pretty much every kind of RPG there is - trad and indie, tabletop and LRP (social, rubber sword, cap gun, 24 hour time in horror LRP).

Not sure what I will do when the studying time is over.<br/>Nerdwise I have been active as a roleplayer for 16 years now. Got my first box of The Dark Eye for my tenth birthday and still play with many members of the group I started that day. We are using Skype nowadays because some of us moved. I have other groups too and am a staff member at a cozy play by post forum with it's own tightknit community. (www.aves-reich.de if anyone reads german) I wrote some stuff for The Dark Eye and am working on a Call of Cthulhu adventure now. We'll see how that goes. I played lots of different games and am always interested in new ones. Fiasco is my most recent purchase.<br/>I'm also a PTQ and Grand Prix level Magic: the Gathering player. The big success has not happened there. But I'm getting better.<br/>I do some board gaming too and always am interested in what makes games tick, the same with stories. So I am analyzing games, books and films a lot. Sometimes to the annoyance of my friends.<br/>Also I never lost a game of Bang! while I was wearing my cowboy hat and ran a game based on the Slenderman while the Something Awful thread that gave birth to it was still running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Icel" title="Icel"><img alt="Icel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/n7G8E3X2QBUOV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Icel">Icel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389043/#Comment_389043" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T09:16:08+00:00" title="September  2, 2012  9:16AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2013 3:12AM by Icel.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Aviv, 25 year old from Israel.

My wife and I are both social workers. I work at Indiana University in Bloomington Indiana treating students depression, anxiety and addictions. I've been in the field since the mid 80's. <br/><br/>I started working on my version of story games back in 1988 and since then Engle Matrix Games have been played all over the world - but not made me much money. Happily a lot of the changes to the hobby I wanted to see happen have happened and my approaches to play are now pretty main stream (at least in this community). I'm still chugging along making new games and starting in 2011 my stuff has been out in stores. I find I can sell around 200 units of games to distribution soooo I'm not making many more than that. Because of advances in POD card printing my production is now largely out sourced. The leaves me more time to work on computer art, gasp, maybe reading for fun again!<br/><br/>Presently the big push is to make a board game engine for the Ipad and other touch screen tables that allows you to up load your own map and counters that you can then move around with your finger. It doesn't run the game for you but it hopefully will allow average game designers to put their games up for sale on the Apple store without spending a ton of money. Sort of the POD of game apps. If it works - and I still not certain it will, it will put another nail in the coffin of card board boxed games. <br/><br/>The future is changing fast and riding it is like surfing one hell of a wave. We don't control it but that's okay. I'm just wondering what comes next.<br/><br/>Oh, check out my blog at <a href="http://hamsterpress.net/" rel="nofollow">Hamster Press</a>. And stop by my booth at Gen Con.<br/><br/>Oh and the other demographic interesting bit about me is that I  converted to Islam in the mid 90's, but I'm a fairly lax Muslim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392775/#Comment_392775" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T17:48:26+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  5:48PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, everybody.

Tabletop-wise, I've mainly played traditional games: D&amp;D 3.5 and nWoD, but I own more story-gaming texts than traditional rpg texts.  I actually do most of my roleplaying online, through MUSHes.  (I just got done writing a pose on one, in fact.  Soon I'm planning on running a few scenes with rules loosely inspired by My Life with Master).  I played on Adam Dray's Firan for a while, actually, and even though I'm not playing it currently, I still consider it the best in terms of how well its theme produces story.  (I've been keeping up with their War Season which is especially dangerous this year.  The game-wide emits have got me hooked even without me being one of the players.  It is producing some amazingly fun story.)<br/><br/>Professionally, I've been an Air Force database administrator and a math teacher.  I've got entirely too many undergraduate degrees.  I'm currently trying to get a job as a National Park Service park guide, or failing that, a similar sort of job where I can teach without being stuck in a classroom.  My best friend IRL is a Harvard law student who is specializing in LGBT rights, and the best thing to happen to me this year is getting to march with her, the NYCLU, and Edith Windsor in the Pride parade back in June.<br/><br/>When I read for fun, it is mostly fantasy fiction series.  My favorites include Discworld, Dresden Files, Anathem, and anything written by Branden Sanderson.  I also like gay fantasy romance, but I'm not going to pretend any of it is especially good.  Someday, though, I hope to read something amazing like Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora with a well-written gay romantic subplot.  I almost never reread a book, though, and if I really like a movie, I might rewatch it once or twice, but probably not more than that.  I am constantly looking for something new, and so that turns my eye to TV a lot: Breaking Bad is the quintessential well-written television show, in my book.  Walt is as interesting as House, but the show never has that episodic everything-is-always-the-same quality.  I've accurately predicted the twist in a few episode, only to be lured into forgetting that it is even relevant before -- WHAM! -- it hits me in the face.  How cool would it be to roleplay with that show's writers?  So cool.  I also read a lot of webcomics.  One of my favorites is Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scd" title="scd"><img alt="scd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/462/n1A1JJEEW3DKV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scd">scd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415248/#Comment_415248" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-01T19:14:26+00:00" title="June  1, 2013  7:14PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I'm Sean.

It is FREE to at-risk youth and one of the coolest things the US Gov has ever done.<br/><br/>I've been doing homebrew rpgs for a looong time and I'm hoping to actually promote my current project sometime in the near future. I love stories - be they in music, on the screen, on the page, or in a game. Just love 'em. And I really appreciate this thread - it's nice to get to know people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings" title="SGTillings"><img alt="SGTillings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SGTillings">SGTillings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419865/#Comment_419865" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-10T08:31:24+00:00" title="August 10, 2013  8:31AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good afternoon!

I have tried on occasion to write a game, but really I am more of a player and GM.  At the moment I have no game group and cannot pay attention to the computer long enough to play games on line via google+ and such, though I do keep trying.

I spent 7 years in video games, and 8 at the doors of bars. My sanctum is Austin, Texas. I collect spare skills and love games and telling stories.<br/><br/>I used to collect pictures of knuckle tattoos and the stories behind them at <a href="http://www.knuckletattoos.com" rel="nofollow">KnuckleTattoos.com</a>, but more recently I started <a href="http://www.storygameworld.com" rel="nofollow">StoryGameWorld</a> collecting and rebroadcasting news about story games.<br/><br/>And now to the brag:<br/>I've put a man in the hospital using only Super Puzzle Fighter II. I played Mario in a Super Smash Brothers fight video that you can see here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5kttOQ5rEQ" rel="nofollow">De-Pixelated - Super Smash Bros Brawl</a>. Stan Lee once called me his hero. I've carried The Hulk's (Lou Ferrigno) bags, and they were heavy. I've never been in a fight in my life. I'm the reason there wasn't enough ammo in the video game Deus Ex. I realized I was a naturalized Texan the night I "defended the Alamo" at The Safe House one drunken night during GenCon when it was in Milwaukee. <br/><br/>I own three cats.<br/><br/>I'm not nearly this bombastic in person.<br/><br/>All this is true.

At this moment I'm finishing my masters in media science (meaning I should rather go ahead and write my thesis than think about some cool aspects for the contest).<br/>I am a little nuts, I believe, but most people are okay with that. I have a big heart (sometimes too big) and can feel love for the strangest things. I'm a little dreamy, too. Again, that's okay, I hope. Makes me likeable.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games came to me in my last teenage years, starting with the German classic The Dark Eye (Das Schwarze Auge). By now, I tested and enjoyed a lot of different styles and systems, never forgetting my roots, so to speak, but enjoying the wealth of variants. <br/>I'm member of a German play by post forum with a wonderful community (aves-reich.de) and get my dose of face to face gaming on a regular basis. I do play via Skype at times, but I'm not that fond of it, I must say. <br/>Besides,  I'm into the arts a lot. Mostly in the 'Amazing! I wish I could do that myself!'-kind of way, but there's got to be someone doing that part, too. I'm happy I can help with that. I do some photographing anyway, just for the fun of it.<br/><br/>Studying the media science, I love to analyze and understand the mechanisms of games, especially in spheres of communication. All the same, I love to simply jump in at the deep end and experience with the heart. I believe there are things better not to think through ever so soundly.<br/><br/>I love roleplaying games for what they are. Simply entertaining and/or truly deep and meaningful. Both is important and just fine with me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425977/#Comment_425977" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-18T22:01:17+00:00" title="December 18, 2013 10:01PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm James!

I'd like to report that the sandwich was super-tasty, but I can not. At least it had a portabella mushroom in it.

That would be telling, wouldn't it? Well, my IRL moniker is... No, I just can't bring myself to, 'cos its not me, and besides, my roleplaying life is what I think of as my 'real' life now, so... Hi, I'm catty_big, good to meet y'all! I've been roleplaying now for all of three and a bit years, but it seems like for<i>EVARZ</i>. Man, I <i>sooo</i> dig roleplaying. So where am I coming from, roleplaying wise? I'll give you a clue, well, three in fact: the first RPG I ever played was Dogs in the Vineyard, at Indiecon, on the beautiful (but cold) English South Coast, in 2010. The next one? Fiasco (Suburbia flavour), then Dead of Night, and then... well, I think you get the picture. <br/><br/>Yes, that's right, I'm a hard-boiled, tie-dyed, kaftan, bead-necklace and sandal-wearing indie hippy gamer. I <i>love</i> innovative mechanics, I dig games that play on raw human emotion, and I adore collaborative games with a high degree of player-generated content. Oh, and I'm really into story-telling. But does that mean I'm never to be found flinging funny-shaped dice across beer-stained tables with bunches of real-ale quaffing beardie weirdies? <i>Hellz</i> no. I'm extremely inclusive, entirely non-judgemental and completely system-agnostic, and just to prove it one of my favourite games currently is Exalted. Yes, you heard me correctly, EXALTED, by WHITE WOLF! I also regularly play in games powered by Ubiquity and PDQ- ok so they're more trindie than trad, but point is I'm willing to try anything, I really am, I just cleave-<i>and boy</i> do I cleave- toward the hippy-dippy stuff, but some of my best games have been ones where I've played elves and dwarves and whatnot, rescuing princesses and retrieving McGuffins of one sort or another, and- well, again, you get the picture.   <br/><br/>I'm also a game designer, just starting out, but I've already co-written and published one game- <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpg/18392/sci-fi-beta-kappa" rel="nofollow">Sci-Fi Beta Kappa</a>- and written two others, which I'm playtesting currently, but for more info about these and other games-in-progress you can visit my page on the <a href="http://ukrpdc.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">UKRP Design Collective website</a> (my publisher name is "indyhippo"). That's another exciting venture I'm involved with: we're trying to raise the profile of UK indie RPG designers, and I'm happy to say we've already kicked up a <i>bit </i>of a storm. [vulcangreeting]Long may the UKRPDC prosper[/vulcangreeting].<br/><br/>About me? Well, I guess I'm fairly liberal as most things go, I try to take peope as I find them, and I like, in fact revel in diversity. I'm currently living in a part of East London (UK) which has traditionally been home to a humungous variety of immigrants over the centuries, and it's great to walk around and hear a myriad languages spoken. At my local supermarket, on a given day you can see Afro-Caribbeans, prayer-capped and hijab-wearing muslims, neutrally dressed Poles and Lithuanians, French, Italian and Chinese, colourfully-dressed Africans and Orthodox jews queuing together and complaining about the price of eggs.  If only those customers could be sent to Northern Ireland, Palestine and Syria, they'd have everyone dancing together in no time. No, probably not, but it's a nice idea. <br/><br/>I\u2019ve both lived and travelled abroad, including Greece, Japan, Portugal, Morocco, most of Western Europe, and in April next year I\u2019m going on an eight-day trip to Cappadocia with my Mum (she\u2019s paying for the holiday as a birthday present for me- couldn\u2019t afford it myself: see above about being a game designer). I speak several languages, enjoy reading, cinema and other artsy stuff, have ambitions to be a creative writer (mostly, but not exclusively SF/F), oh and I\u2019m a Christian. <br/><br/>And in the, ahem, basement section? Alas, there I disappoint. I'm boringly hetero, boringly cis, boringly vanilla, boring in fact in every conceivable way. But I like to think I'm quite a <i>nice</i>, friendly, out-going, tolerant person, and that has to count for <i>something</i>, right?                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/s_mcc" title="s_mcc"><img alt="s_mcc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/724/nHLKKNRUMHFZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/s_mcc">s_mcc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426265/#Comment_426265" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-25T21:53:32+00:00" title="December 25, 2013  9:53PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/><br/>Shawn McCarthy and I'm taking a little sanity break from holiday merrymaking up here in the middle of Canada.

I'm 39, currently unemployed and trying to figure out what I'm going to do with my life. Until September I worked for a UK democratic reform pressure group for nine years. I was involved in party politics for many years, first as an employee and ultimately at a quite senior level but I gave all that up two years ago because it was depressing me. This makes me a bit of a weary cynic but I try my best to keep that under control.<br/><br/>I'm quite new to indie/story gaming, having played my first game of Fiasco (thanks, Wil Wheaton!) 17 months ago. I got on board quite quickly however and am now a regular at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-RPG-Meetup-Group/" rel="nofollow">London Indiemeet</a>.<br/><br/>Before that, I played my first roleplaying game 30 years ago, having been inspired by The Warlock of Firetop Mountain and Mazes and Monsters (thanks, Tom Hanks!). The first game I bought was RuneQuest 2 but I mainly played D&amp;D, our own variant of Middle Earth Roleplaying (we didn't understand the rules so sort of improvised), Golden Heroes, the Judge Dredd RPG, the Warhammer RPG and eventually Vampire: the Masquerade.

I'm a fellow member of the halifax indie gaming scene along with Sam Fraser (GrowGiant, see above) in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  I played D&amp;D in jr. high and undergrad.  In college, in the 90s I studied theatre, drama-in-education, theatre of the oppressed, experiential education, and drama therapy. All of these fringe fields looked like ways to make a career based on role-playing techniques and principles. I experimented with said career in Canada for a while before giving in to the temptation to go east. I spent 8 years in Taiwan &amp; Japan working for the anglolinguistic-industrial complex   <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/><br/>Finally I tired of that, came back to Canada, law school and became a criminal defence lawyer.  I don't regret giving up on the dream of being a professional role-player drama-therapist or whatever I was thinking. Instead I'm thrilled to return to the hobby with a perspective that doing something you love as a hobby can actually be much more satisfying than trying to force it to be your livelihood. This is not too discourage others who can make it as gamers, designers, or professional whatsits...  you just gotta know yourself.<br/><br/>Anyways we blog about the games we play in Halifax at <a href="http://higs.motd.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://higs.motd.org/</a>.

I've recently turned thirty, and I work for the federal government as a court officer and bureaucrat in the insolvency field.  It's weird-but-rewarding work, and roleplaying turned out to be a transferable skill to this work.<br/><br/>I am as into story video games as I am story roleplaying games, and I'm also very into cooking.<br/><br/>I came I to roleplaying when I was eight years old.  I've always gravitated to the story side of things, but the last few years of play have been transformative for me, as I've found a group who is as into this stuff as I am, and so we push each other and explore together.  Those friends and I recently launched <a href="http://shakerattleandroleplay.libsyn.com" rel="nofollow">a podcast</a>, and while we're still finding our voice, there are moments where I think we are starting to sound like we know what we're talking about.<br/><br/>I lurk a lot, as you folks often have really interesting things to say, and often I don't have a lot to add.  But I read and learn, and I feel like I've become a better player, and found my voice as a GM, for that reading.  Thank you all for that.<br/><br/>My favourite games of the moment include Primetime Adventures, as my go-to game for most things, and Monsterhearts, as my current obsession.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Conproteens" title="Conproteens"><img alt="Conproteens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/435/nWVIZS61AH65W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Conproteens">Conproteens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427750/#Comment_427750" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T02:05:21+00:00" title="January 29, 2014  2:05AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello!

Now I spend my time working in at Canada's largest talk radio station and and producing a podcast called The Terrible Warriors where we sit down each month and play a 4-hour gaming session, each time a new RPG, and seperate them into 1-hour episodes. <br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to meeting more members of the community here and learning more about games I've never heard of and sharing reports of the games we've tried in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir" title="AlbeyAmakiir"><img alt="AlbeyAmakiir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/139/nCE1BSIBJZEBM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir">AlbeyAmakiir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428259/#Comment_428259" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-12T16:01:16+00:00" title="February 12, 2014  4:01PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya.<br/><br/>I'm Albey Amakiir. "Who are you?" has always been a difficult question for me to answer. Who am I? Really? Deep down? *Existential crisis*<br/><br/>I love games. More broadly, I love systems designed for play and creativity. It doesn't have to be games, but they take up the vast majority. Playing them, making them, reading about why people made certain design decisions, theory, practise, philosophy, psychology, and so on. Helps that I'm a programmer and probably an artist. Someday, I might share what I've finished, which is very little...<br/><br/>I'd like to make a GM-less story-game, someday. But right now, I'm just trying as many as I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kingCrackers" title="kingCrackers"><img alt="kingCrackers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kingCrackers">kingCrackers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428275/#Comment_428275" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-13T14:57:18+00:00" title="February 13, 2014  2:57PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 13, 2014 2:59PM by kingCrackers.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            \u4f60\u597d. <br/>I'm Jiyang, and I live in Singapore, and am of Chinese ethnicity.

My bad.<br/><br/>I'm Georg Mir, born 1982 (currently 31+) from Graz, Austria, Europe. I work as User Experience Designer and Creative Officer in the Casino Entertainment Industry. <br/><br/>I've been through a rough patch of life lately, but managed to pull through, with the help of my long-term boyfriend (currently nearly 6 years). From the beginning of our relationship, we created a shared mental space, called T\xfcrnaya\xa0that is inhabited by Michtims, little hamster-like creatures with a love for food, nature, technology and magic. In 2011 I decided to actually write and publish a game about them; it was also my master thesis in Media &amp; Interaction Design.<br/><br/>I grew up as odd child with no friends of my age. I befriended old people (my Ma was sister in charge in a nursing home for the elderly) and tried to connect with random people (my Father was part Entertainer/Musician and had a small shop in town, selling bags and shiny things). My sisters are +15 and +17 years older, so I basically grew up without siblings. Once I went to school, I really didn't know how to interact with kids of my age. That lack of social interaction skills is still with me. I was called "Crazy Professor" on good days, and other, less friendly things by my class mates on the bad days.<br/><br/>At age 12 I created my first RPG, without knowing what an RPG was. <br/>At age 16 I first played D&amp;D. After that, I breezed through VtR/WoD, Kult, Shadowrun, Little Fears and other games.<br/><br/>Nowadays, I've lost contact to my gamer group. We fell apart over our real life problems, and so it means, I'm just a collector at the moment. My bf and me tell Michtim stories every day though. The world has become a second home to me. When life gets rough, I go hide in my alter ego and hope for better days.<br/><br/>Well, that's me. I'm a random bipolar designer/engineer/geek-type of guy on the internet. <br/><br/>Nice to meet you! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429879/#Comment_429879" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T17:26:39+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  5:26PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2014 5:55PM by catty_big.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops, posted in wrong forum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/goofy_the_dog" title="goofy_the_dog"><img alt="goofy_the_dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/goofy_the_dog">goofy_the_dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430393/#Comment_430393" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-01T13:12:47+00:00" title="April  1, 2014  1:12PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey people, name's Jacob.

If it's a way to earn money I've either done it, do it, or will soon start doing it, but have no real interest in work as a defining characteristic. If I had to categorize by avocation I guess it would be as an academic. Divorced, father of adult daughter (and budding geek-off-the-block). <br/><br/>Have been a game fiend my entire life. First rpg was D&amp;D back in about 1980, and it has remained by far the central element of my entertainment life since. Have played too many games to list, and am always looking for new things to experience. <br/><br/>Since high school my rpg experience has been far more story game based than seems common in my experience. We tend to prefer using standard dice &amp; paper games as a baseline, but inject far more plot and narrative than hack 'n slash or power gaming. I still play (infrequently) with my high school group, but have also branched out and found many other groups to play with or run (I end up being GM/DM more often than not where applicable).<br/><br/>Either alone or with friends I've written/hacked various games: D&amp;D Enthusiast Edition (mostly a Basic/1st/2nd house rule set), The Frontier (a history-focused wild west rpg), Stupid Heroes (mythbusters meets mystery men comic book rpg), and Shadowrun 2012 (a cobbling of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd edition SR with a few house rules to boot).<br/><br/>I'm currently playing in one regular and one semi-regular groups, and running 3 regular and 2 semi-regular groups. We're playing mostly the custom ones listed above, but also have Battletech, Gamma World, Mouse Guard, Star Wars, World of Darkness, Top Secret, and Star Trek campaigns in progress. Of course we also have frequent board and true story game nights, though do mostly one-shots for these.<br/><br/>One other item of note - I'm a pretty extreme Grognard in the sense of generally preferring older games and disliking edition evolutions which significantly alter inherent game aspects. I usually fall in love with the unique merger of system &amp; setting, and so grow fairly uninterested when either are left behind. As such you'll find I generally play earlier editions of games, with some house rules to correct issues without losing the flavor. Not that I'm closed to new games though. I found Burning Wheel a brilliant framework, and Mouse Guard is among my favorite games. For whatever reason those seem to be aberrations as opposed to my baseline however.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's me. I was researching some Shadowrun issues and stumbled upon an old thread here (which I fully intend to necro). Looking forward to the exchange of ideas and information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus" title="Ursus_Spelaeus"><img alt="Ursus_Spelaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus">Ursus_Spelaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430696/#Comment_430696" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-08T16:09:05+00:00" title="April  8, 2014  4:09PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello everybody!<br/>My name is Kevin.

I spent half of my life in Kansas, though. As a college student I studied linguistics and psychology - which, I notice always in retrospect, affect how I play RPGs and think/write about the hobby somehow. Right now I'm held up doing my mandatory civil service, but I plan to get back to Korean-English translation once the duty is over. As a sort of more-dedicated-than-usual hobby, I like to tinker with game ideas. Korean shamanism has been my major theme recently. Fascinating stuff.<br/><br/>More demographic information: Socially I'm left leaning radical left, financially I'm probably lower middle class, religion-wise I'm "atheist" with strong hints of Taoism.<br/><br/>Also, this is off topic, but - <a href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus">@Ursus_Spelaeus</a>, I met you in person before, at the Dive &amp; Dice meetup.

But feel free to call me Bert. I'm 20 years old, white, and currently live in San Diego, CA. I'm currently attending community college as an English major and plan to simply get any job and get my way through grad school. However, I eventually want teach and write novels. I currently work at a yacht club as a waiter. You'll find that I am a reasonable fellow that still has a lot to learn.<br/><br/>My whole life I've loved playing games of all kinds. As I got older, I grew out of video games and became fascinated with tabletop (or traditional games). I've only ever played D&amp;D and Pathfinder but I've come to realize that all the gear and stats and classes don't really interest me. What truly captivates me about traditional gaming is the story and the characters. So I thought I'd give this place a try. Like I stated earlier, I still have a lot to learn, so if you see that I should be doing something differently, please feel free to point it out and I'll reflect on it and possibly try to work on it (after all, you might just be a jerk). I hope to have a lot of fun and eventually create beautiful stories with you all.<br/><br/>The games that I'd love to try the most are FATE Rpg, Dungeon World, and Apocalypse World. However, I'm open to pretty much any game that will allow me to stretch out my imagination. Can't wait to give this a try!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jeshields" title="jeshields"><img alt="jeshields" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/130/nLR8M77VSD7M4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jeshields">jeshields</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431741/#Comment_431741" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-28T06:38:41+00:00" title="April 28, 2014  6:38AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2014 6:39AM by jeshields.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey fellow gamers!<br/><br/>I am James E. Shields, better known as Jeshields across the internet. No relation to that other James Shields.<br/><br/>I am in my mid-30s, have a wife and four children, and have been gaming for over two decades. Favorite systems include The Classic Marvel RPG, Rifts, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, Elfquest and now Cortex. Additionally, I am a freelance artist who specializes in characters with a classic black and white RPG style.<br/><br/>I have recently begun a project to help independent game developers afford high quality custom illustrations. It is also designed for GMs and gamers addicted to character creation like I am. (<a href="http://www.patreon.com/jeshields" rel="nofollow">www.patreon.com/jeshields</a> is the link if you care to check it out.)<br/><br/>My most recent published work has appeared in supplements created by Rogue Games.

I've been working in RPGs since 2004: three years as an RPG freelancer author/designer, 2.5 years as a D&amp;D developer at WotC, 3 years suffocating under crushing depression, and now I finally have the mental breathing space to push myself to grow as an author and game designer. I'm working on very short fiction (you can <a href="http://catachresis.shoelesspetegames.com/" rel="nofollow">read some here</a>), as well as tabletop board games and RPGs.

I have been playing all year. I've been lurking around Story-games for sometime now and I'm still a bit intimidated, but I'm eager to learn and discuss great stuff with you all.<br/><br/>I'm deeply in love with Apocalypse World, despite the fact that it does not love me back yet, but I'm confident in the future.

I'm a 46-year old married father of two young boys, and Iive in Santa Cruz, California, which is also where I work as a software product manager. I started playing D&amp;D in 1980 and quickly moved on to the Arduin Grimoire, Gamma World, Top Secret, RuneQuest, Aftermath!, Twilight: 2000, Shadowrun, and others. For most of my 20s I didn't do much gaming, and it wasn't until my early 30s that I got a quarterly weekend of gaming going with my old high school gaming friends. That lasted for a few years, and we had fun playing Call of Cthulhu, Basic Roleplaying, and the odd d20 game.<br/><br/>After a while those quarterly gatherings became more about socializing and less about playing the games. For a time I figured the jig was up and it was time to put away my games for good, but on a whim I checked out a D&amp;D Meetup group in the area and created a profile. Thankfully a small local group was looking to replace a player who'd moved out of town, and they invited me to a session of Call of Cthulhu. That was almost four years ago, and we've been gaming most Friday nights ever since.<br/><br/>Over that span we've played Call of Cthulhu, Eclipse Phase, Spirit of the Century, ORE, RuneQuest, Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, Pathfinder, Burning Wheel, Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, Savage Worlds, Twilight: 2013, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire. Egads, that's a lot of games.<br/><br/>The last four years have been by far the most fruitful for me as a gamer, because our group works so well together and because we've explored so many games that have expanded my understanding of what tabletop roleplaying can be. A year and a half ago I started <a href="http://learntabletoprpgs.com" rel="nofollow">Learn Tabletop RPGs</a>, which is always a work in progress.<br/><br/>I've read threads in Story Games and decided it was time to join as a member, though I suspect I'll be doing less talking than listening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109" title="icemaster109"><img alt="icemaster109" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/icemaster109">icemaster109</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435405/#Comment_435405" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-16T17:59:23+00:00" title="July 16, 2014  5:59PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello I'm Al.

I'm Candace, I'm a 31-year-old from Melbourne, Australia. I'm a novelist-in-training but also really excitable when it comes to different kinds of storytelling. I recently read Lizzie Stark's book and it's safe to say it blew my mind, and made me realise there's a whole lot out there aside from the medieval war campaign hitting-people-with-weapons games that never really drew me. The closest I've come to any kind of RPG are drama games and improv. I haven't gone to any larp's or games yet, as all the ones I've found are either huge battle campaigns or games whose campaigns are wrapping up their plotlines for the year and I'm hesitant to jump in at the end of something so entrenched. But there seems to be a huge Con scene here for all sorts of RPGs, one-off 'freeforms' that look like the ideal way to start a little bit of newbie play.<br/><br/>But really, the reason why I am obsessively reading up on all of this the way that I have been (digging into all the things around the place about the various international scenes and terminology disputes and game story structure/lack of structure/writing etc), is that I already love the idea of constructing something of my own. Which is hilariously presumptive-sounding, isn't it? I tend to learn by writing though, and I'll probably only play around and do a small-scale for friends, if anything comes of all this obsessing.<br/><br/>So yes. Mind = blown. Probably will go back to lurking though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437818/#Comment_437818" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T21:41:31+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  9:41PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2014 10:43PM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Everyone, <br/>My name is Chris.  I'm a language professional: EFL teacher, curriculum designer, editor, researcher, and sometimes translator.  Language is my thing.  I sort of speak five of them.  I've studied at least eight.  And studied linguistic anthropology in graduate school.  I love thinking about language, teaching language, learning languages, and researching about language.  I blame Tolkien.<br/><br/>So, with this love of language, as you might expect, I don't live in my country of origin, anymore.  I live in China.  And before that South Korea; and before that Indonesia.<br/><br/>I started playing OD&amp;D around 1977, when I was in middle school.  Moved on to AD&amp;D 1E, Traveler, Runequest 2E, Call of Cthulhu, Iron Crown, MERPS, and Pendragon.  For about seven or eight years, my group played at lunch, after school, on the weekend--anytime we could role-play, we role-played.  We had a long-running Glorantha campaign, where we had several characters each become runelord-priests and then minor heroes.  My friends were all mini-maxers, but I was a story-gamer, even back then--though I didn't know it.  I also played miniatures war-gaming at that time, as well with the heart of a story-gamer--I didn't win many games that way.  <br/><br/>Then it all ended.  Adult life got too demanding.  And my gaming groups dispersed to the four corners of the Earth, literally.  I stopped playing for more than 25 years.<br/><br/>I recently picked up the hobby again to use as a club activity with my advanced Chinese EFL students.  I teach at a private bilingual school in eastern China.  I've also played a few games with some of my co-workers.  I'm a little more than a bit fascinated with role-playing games, again.  I found your site, because I was looking for a rules-lite system that I could translate into Chinese and simple English (BE850).  I really had no idea about story-games or the indie scene till I got here.<br/><br/>I don't really see myself as an (aspiring or professional) game designer; but I do like writing supplemental material for role-playing games: settings, adventures, etc.  I'm obsessed about back-story and world building.  I blame Tolkien, Stafford, and Gaiman.<br/><br/>I love cyber-punk, anything.<br/><br/>If English is not your first language, and you would like help with the English language text of your game, whisper to me.  I might be able to help.  I do that kind of editing on a regular basis.<br/><br/>peace,<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437825/#Comment_437825" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T03:17:52+00:00" title="August 27, 2014  3:17AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2014 3:18AM by catty_big.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Chris.

Now my dream is to suppres the language barrier (my english is bad, but slowly I'm funding the translation of all my games thanks to the proceeds of the sale of the other games!) and to share with you my passion and my enthusiasm for what I do!<br/><br/>A big hug from Italy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438201/#Comment_438201" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-09T10:32:42+00:00" title="September  9, 2014 10:32AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/vasquas">@vasquas</a> Are you on G+ dude?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438571/#Comment_438571" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-20T04:15:21+00:00" title="September 20, 2014  4:15AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2014 4:15AM by vasquas.">edited September 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/catty_big">@catty_big</a> yes, My name is: Giovanni Micolucci (add me in your circle!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439028/#Comment_439028" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T10:30:20+00:00" title="October  5, 2014 10:30AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2014 11:54AM by catty_big.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/catty_big">@catty_big</a> yes, My name is: Giovanni Micolucci (add me in your circle!).</blockquote>\nYou're already there dude!

I suffer the burden of my genes.<br/><br/>I like this poem by Craig Raine:-<br/><br/><b>A Martian Sends a Postcard Home</b><br/><br/>Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings <br/>and some are treasured for their markings-- <br/><br/>they cause the eyes to melt <br/>or the body to shriek without pain. <br/><br/>I have never seen one fly, but <br/>sometimes they perch on the hand. <br/><br/>Mist is when the sky is tired of flight <br/>and rests its soft machine on the ground: <br/><br/>then the world is dim and bookish <br/>like engravings under tissue paper. <br/><br/>Rain is when the earth is television. <br/>It has the properties of making colours darker. <br/><br/>Model T is a room with the lock inside -- <br/>a key is turned to free the world <br/><br/>for movement, so quick there is a film <br/>to watch for anything missed. <br/><br/>But time is tied to the wrist <br/>or kept in a box, ticking with impatience. <br/><br/>In homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps, <br/>that snores when you pick it up. <br/><br/>If the ghost cries, they carry it <br/>to their lips and soothe it to sleep <br/><br/>with sounds. And yet, they wake it up <br/>deliberately, by tickling with a finger. <br/><br/>Only the young are allowed to suffer <br/>openly. Adults go to a punishment room <br/><br/>with water but nothing to eat. <br/>They lock the door and suffer the noises <br/><br/>alone. No one is exempt <br/>and everyone's pain has a different smell. <br/><br/>At night, when all the colours die, <br/>they hide in pairs <br/><br/>and read about themselves -- <br/>in colour, with their eyelids shut.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439840/#Comment_439840" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-31T22:53:29+00:00" title="October 31, 2014 10:53PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2014 11:42PM by AsIf.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I decided to post this here because it actually does explain a lot about who I am.<br/><br/>It was 22 years ago today that my theatrical larp <b>Ghosts in the Machine</b> was first performed with a live audience at the CyberArts International Conference in Pasadena, California.

Now that I'm attempting to be more proactive in the hobby, I thought I would check back in. <br/><br/>I go by a lot of names, Jackson to most. I'm 27 years old and a freelance writer by trade, and I've been playing since about 12 years old. I've got really eclectic taste in role-playing games, but wind up reading them more than I ever get to play. Mostly, I like digging through things and seeing what mechanical solutions they come up with to design problems. <br/><br/>I currently maintain a blog (<a href="http://swordandscoundrel.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://swordandscoundrel.blogspot.com</a>) on role-playing games, design topics, and the industry. I'm also working on completing the Band of Bastards RPG (<a href="http://grandheresy.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://grandheresy.com</a>) which will be out for public beta before long. <br/><br/>I'm also currently running an OSR AD&amp;D/ Lamentations mashup that's been going on for about six weeks now.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440128/#Comment_440128" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-15T15:33:13+00:00" title="November 15, 2014  3:33PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If any of you new users are on social media (I'm on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102280518215937463274?tab=wX#102280518215937463274/posts?tab=wX" rel="nofollow">G+</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/catty_big" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>), if you're happy to share, could you please add links to your pages?

As most of us, I've gone through different cycles of were my primary interests are: board wargames (mostly 80s), roleplaying games (90s), collectible card games (90s), miniature wargaming (mostly 2000s till the present).<br/><br/>For the past couple of years, I have been mostly interested in combining miniature wargaming with story-driven techniques. We have experimented quite a lot with matrix-style arguments, combined with voting, to push a game forwards (article about this was published in the magazine Battlegames, issue #33).<br/><br/>Another interest is mass-participation wargames: how to get &gt;100 people involved in a convention game? Last year, we ran such a game at a con, getting over 250 people to participate - each person adding a micro-decision to the overall game flow. For those interested in reading more about this, this is published in this month's issue of Miniature Wargames ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dave_sokolowski" title="dave_sokolowski"><img alt="dave_sokolowski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dave_sokolowski">dave_sokolowski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441356/#Comment_441356" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-12T14:58:44+00:00" title="January 12, 2015  2:58PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good day, I'm Dave. By day, I'm a husband and father of one 9yo girl. I work as an ecommerce program manager for a large science/tech company, trying to make things run in a coherent manner. I live in Silicon Valley where I lucked into a nice, small house before housing because totally unreasonable (it was just unreasonable before), where I keep my games and my family. There are a lot of reasons to like living here, but all the BMWs get a bit obscene after a while.<br/><br/>At home, I wash a lot of dishes and try to drive myself to write more. I play boardgames and RPGs with a great gaming group, who are really just my friends. I'm currently running Mask of Nyarlathotep for them using Call of Cthulhu, which used to be my favorite system but isn't really any more.<br/><br/>Last year, I ran a Kickstarter for a modern day Cthulhu scenario called He Who Laughs Last. Right now I'm prepping for another, while also trying to be more organized and productive in communities (like this one) and on my blog (<a href="http://weird8.com" rel="nofollow">weird8.com</a>). I recently wrote about teaching 5e D&amp;D to my daughter, which has been an amazing experience. We are having so much fun.<br/><br/>I like story above system. I love collaboration, both in work and RPGs. I have little patience for people and systems that act like children. I am on Twitter (<a href="/forums/profile/SokolowskiDave%29">@SokolowskiDave)</a>, and am trying to do more stuff there too.

I'm a Swedish software engineer who has played RPGs since the 80's, and done game design since the 00's. I published a couple of games and have now gathered them on <a href="https://wilhelmsgames.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Wilhelm's Games</a>.<br/><br/>After losing touch with my gaming group due to work travel I have pretty much gone into hibernation when it comes to RPGs. But I run Play by Post games on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/106887421463229016397/about" rel="nofollow">G+</a>. It is fun, even if it is not the same thing as tabletop gaming.  I occasionally look for players for those games. (If you add me and your profile isn't clear on our gaming connection, shoot me a message, otherwise I'll just think you're a spam bot and block.)<br/><br/>I have drifted into playing <a href="https://online-go.com/user/view/97974/wilper" rel="nofollow">go online</a> the last couple of months, it is a brilliant board game. I waste time and money on <a href="https://photofying.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">photography</a>, but don't have much to show for it yet.

I'm Jonathan Cook. I live in East Tennessee (Greeneville, to be precise). I've been lurking in online indie game circles for a long time (if you sort the members list by date registered on the Forge, I'm #13). But except for some failed experiments as a kid, I've only really been playing RPGs for the last couple years. The excellent group I play with leans trad, but has largely taken to some of the story game kool-aid I've been slipping them. <br/><br/>I also got to significantly increase the number of story games I've played by quitting my job and going on a cross-country adventure last summer. I got to play with a number of awesome groups, including The Gauntlet in Houston, Story Games Seattle and Olympia, and the fine folks at NewMexicon.<br/><br/>Since getting back home I've been gaming more than ever while continuing to nurse an existential crisis about what exactly I'm gonna do with my life.

After the initial shock of a giant hardback I ended up intrigued by it enough to try out Alternity, AD&amp;D and went from there.<br/>In the last few years after being introduced to Houses of the Blooded &amp; Fiasco at Dragonmeet, I've been finding out about story games. My group are evolving from being all about the trad games, although generally their main problem if their fear of a lack of structure to enforce play. Dungeon World and Apocalypse World seems to have hit the right note. Fate is a system I love, but one of my group freezes up with fear when he has to think if stunts &amp; aspects, stuck with analysis paralysis which isn't helped by providing several examples. We're feeling our way around story games and I'm trying to inject what I learnt into the occasional trad game I run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/YsAdamsson" title="YsAdamsson"><img alt="YsAdamsson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/YsAdamsson">YsAdamsson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442664/#Comment_442664" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-08T11:31:00+00:00" title="February  8, 2015 11:31AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Ys from a little town near Seattle.

Tabletop RPGS are my main hobby, though I also enjoy backpacking, quad skating, and cooking outdoors in cast iron dutch ovens.<br/><br/>I started my RPG hobby with AD &amp; D, and have GMed Star Frontiers, Traveller, GURPS 3, GURPS 4, Savage Worlds, FAE and FATE CORE. My weekly gaming group, a.k.a. Team Weird, has been running continuously for 10 years now in New York City. We play a cinematic GURPS 4 in the house Infinite Worlds setting and rotate GMing duty. The group has changed over the years, people come and go as reality intrudes, but in general we've been lucky to have great players at the table any given week. <br/><br/>I also run a home game of GURPS Banestorm -- or at the moment, Banestorm Spelljammer! -- with my son. I started him on gaming when he was about 8. Now he's 20. He plays the same characters today that we generated then. Needless to say, they've developed into near demigods. In his last mission, he destroyed the Illithid fleet and home base asteroid. Yes, I throw in a lot of D &amp; D monsters. He needs to have a classical education, right? <br/><br/>As a counterbalance to all that GURPS crunchiness, my game of choice for cons and one-shots is FATE CORE. At my last con, I ran a FATE CORE scenario in Frank Herbert's Duniverse. This time around, I'm running a Secrets of Cats adventure (see my other post in Meetups/Cons).<br/><br/>Good to meet you!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brandon%20p" title="brandon p"><img alt="brandon p" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brandon%20p">brandon p</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445058/#Comment_445058" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-01T17:18:26+00:00" title="May  1, 2015  5:18PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Everyone, <br/><br/>My name is Brandon. I signed up here a long time ago which was at the tail end of my physical gaming life so I never became active. Since then I dropped off the map of gaming because I became too busy and didn't have time (self employed, starting a family.. life stuff). Before that I had been a weekly gamer for 20+ years. <br/><br/>Lately I've been tinkering more with game designs, while trying to get a few online things going (which all have failed).  I thought I'd start rejoining the forums I used to follow.  Get up to speed on gaming again even if I have no idea if I'll ever find the free time to game at a table with actual people!<br/><br/>Besides a general interest in RPG's and game design, I'm working on a story game that can be played with kids who can't read yet (aka my own children), and a personal rules light game design. Which means I'll probably post about those for advice or fun. Specially when I start testing the game with my daughter,  Kids do the most awesome things while telling stories! <br/><br/>Brandon<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/open_sketchbook" title="open_sketchbook"><img alt="open_sketchbook" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/933/nPHEC2DTFRPI7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/open_sketchbook">open_sketchbook</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445222/#Comment_445222" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-14T19:00:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2015  7:00PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I'm open_sketchbook!<br/><br/>I write games under the name <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4945/Newstand-Press" rel="nofollow">Newstand Press</a> on DriveThruRPG. I write a lot of small 1 and 2 page games as well as some larger stuff; my biggest release so far is <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/132192/Must-be-Tuesday" rel="nofollow">Must be Tuesday</a>, a Buffy the Vampire Slayer themed light RPG.<br/><br/>I've been playing RPGs since I was 13 years old. I was really into hardcore optimized D&amp;D 3.5 and Dark Heresy immediately after high school, but I since discovered indie RPGs (Starting with Burning Wheel, which I was introduced to via the Geeknights podcast) and have become much more invested in those kinds of games. Probably my favourite game right now is Torchbearer.<br/><br/>I like my games small, without cruft and with very narrow focuses. For example, my game <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144522/Hell-on-Treads" rel="nofollow">Hell on Treads</a> <i>only</i> does "The PCs are a tank crew on a mission." Fair warning: I generally dislike worldbuilding in games and I kinda see it as an admission that the mechanics alone can't carry the game. As a result I usually write games that are coded to popular genres and media. I understand this isn't a popular view, and I actually really like the creative process of worldbuilding itself, but I <i>hate</i> putting things in a rulebook that aren't rules!<br/><br/>My big projects right now are PATROL, a spiritual successor to the 1980s Palladium game RECON, and a Magical Girl game called 5 Across the Heart. Rather than having a development blog, I have <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/in-which-sketch-makes-games.5932/" rel="nofollow">a thread on a forum</a> where I track my progress.

These monthly events are beginner-friendly and we typically draw between twenty and thirty gamers (of late, I've played a lot of Fiasco and Dungeon World to introduce new players to tabletop RPGs; I've found these systems to be the best way to rope folks into our geeky hobby.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/smalltowncinema" title="smalltowncinema"><img alt="smalltowncinema" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/215/nQ82VULTV8WBK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/smalltowncinema">smalltowncinema</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445372/#Comment_445372" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-27T19:03:04+00:00" title="May 27, 2015  7:03PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello all, I'm Aaron.

My background is mostly in very traditional RPGs, both OSR and otherwise (particular interests: RuneQuest, early edition D&amp;D, and Ars Magica). But over time I've been getting more and more interested in story game-like stuff, in particular the PbtA games. From lurking here for a while, it seems like this forum is home to some of the best discussion and thinking about RPGs, both traditional and in their story game strain, that I've seen anywhere online. So here I am.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448827/#Comment_448827" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-30T14:50:22+00:00" title="September 30, 2015  2:50PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome Alex!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris" title="ericvulgaris"><img alt="ericvulgaris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nJV8DKZOO3TSE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris">ericvulgaris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448949/#Comment_448949" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-08T23:23:21+00:00" title="October  8, 2015 11:23PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2015 11:37PM by ericvulgaris.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi I'm Eric. I'm 24 and recently moved from Philadelphia to Seattle. and currently full-timing as a Business Analyst for a Union trust management administrator. It's as exciting as it sounds.<br/><br/>I'm a casual streamer on Twitch.tv/ericvulgaris and/or seen lurking around anything DW co-designer Adam Koebel does online. Also, I'm a new, but diehard member of Story Games Seattle. <br/><br/>Game design and sharing/interacting/introducing indie games is my absolute passion.<br/><br/>I've been playing RPGs for over a decade now and recently been getting into indie games and story games. I prefer games that are tight in scope which usually focus on relationships and serious drama than epic tales of action/adventure. Contrary to my usual taste in focused games is my favorite game of them all: Microscope. <br/><br/>I love that game so much I'm literally right now writing up a presentation video explaining why this game is so good subjectively and objectively!<br/><br/>In the near future I will be streaming my games of Microscope online! Additionally I'm working on various tweaks and hacks to RPGs as well as a real-deal hexcrawl supplement to be published either end of 2015 or early 2016. <br/><br/>Ben Robbins and Jason Morningstar, if you're reading this, know I love everything you guys do and you both basically changed my life and how I view games.

For about five years after that I was exclusively D&amp;D until a little game called <i>Changeling: The Lost</i> made me check out the World of Darkness.<br/><br/>I stayed within that sphere for a couple of years until <i>Marvel Heroic Roleplaying</i> stole my attention away, and since then I've started eagerly consuming games like <i>Fiasco, Psi*Run, Primetime Adventures</i>, and Powered by the Apocalypse games (current favorite: <i>Monster of the Week</i>).<br/><br/>My groups trend trad, and specifically like games that focus on character builds and overcoming obstacles unrelated to the narrative (read: adventure games).

I'm 42, live in Oakland CA, and work from home as a system administrator for an online commerce company.<br/><br/>I started playing Moldvay Red Box D&amp;D in elementary school, a bunch of Palladium systems in high school, and GURPS in my early 20s. After that I drifted towards less crunchy rulesets like FUDGE and started groping towards more story-based gaming. About 10 years ago I moved up to the Bay Area for work, lost my regular group, and stopped playing RPGs. <br/><br/>A couple of years ago a friend of mine told me about Big Bad Con in Oakland and, on a whim, I went. I had a great time and got interested in tabletop gaming again. <br/><br/>I have a small kid and I'm at the age where a lot of my friends are in the same boat, so I'm experimenting with doing story game one-shots from time to time since scheduling a weekly game is so difficult. The first session is in a couple of weeks and I have a mix of experienced and totally novice players. I'm going to try running an Apocalypse World one-shot spread across two sessions on a lazy Saturday.

I'm 45, located in the wilds of Iowa, and married for 16 years.  I am currently taking some courses in programming and technology.  I played RPGs years ago with an old boyfriend of mine, he was also a DM. I recently came across a Ghostbusters set to play with my family at Christmas and was a bit astounded as the scope and breadth of games now available.  <br/>I also have a girlfriend who is an activist who is struggling with communicating issues regarding race and poverty to a subset of the group she works with.  I suggested an rpg.  After she got done looking at me like I was growing a horn out of my forehead, I explained that games like these start with player characters who have strengths and weakness, and those are defined by the game.  Those players have to play those characters within the constraints defined by their character using a narrative that's provided by the gamemaster.  And that sociologist have been successful in using directed gameplay with some of the topics she wants to address.  So now I think I have been volunteered to find or help build a game. <br/>Anywho, I'm glad to be here and thanks for having me.

I have lived in Denmark all my life.<br/><br/>I have been lurking for longer than i care to admit, and i am working on a roleplaying system and have been doing so concentrated for 3 years - even longer on-an-off. It has been through more iterations than i can count - so calling it a single system is fallacious, probably. It is finally taking definite shape, though.<br/><br/>Both I and the system is in dire need of a community, feedback, critique and enthusiasm. i have found my normal playtesting group lacking in feedback quality, since they either play traditional games and do not stray from neither that mindset nor mechanics, or are disinterested in engaging with the system - i need new eyes and informed opinions on my game design.<br/> I hope to find new people to commute with, and be able to give feedback to others if they want it.<br/><br/>I'll post all the info about my game in another thread. <br/><br/>Apart from that, i enjoy cooking. reading fantasy, sci-fi and historical books, sagas, semiotics and semantics, philosophy and video-gaming.

I can be quite obsessively single-minded about a project I'm currently working on (which is usually what I'm googling about). I am also a notorious jack of all trades master of... you get the idea. Designing a game has been one of my recent obsessions, but have been a long time Role Player (though it happens less frequently than I like).<br/><br/>I was lucky enough that my High School D&amp;D friends (we discovered the game together actually), were like me in that they were more interested in building a world and having cool characters in it than anything else. Before we even cracked a players handbook we made a map of a fantasy world. We have been adding to it on-and-off ever since then (about 13 years). Only in the last 4 yrs did I break out of my comfort zone and try playing with games with only six sided die *gasp* Boy was I excited to find games where rules stayed out of my way and let me do the things I enjoy.<br/><br/>But about everything else. I am originally from the Midwest (US) and now live in the Southwest (US). Other than RPG's and boardgames, I dabble in writing, art, I hike, and drink good beer. I generally have tons of ideas and complete very few of them. <br/><br/>I will try to stick around this time and say hello and comment more often, but no promises with the way my attention wanes. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454451/#Comment_454451" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T19:56:18+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  7:56PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2016 7:56PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice to online-meet you!

That is pretty much exactly the recreation I was going for, a more general system that can stretch to different sorts of sci-fi expectations. The characters all embody some trope we've seen on television and movies. As for the cyberpunk vibe come's from my love for the grittier nearish feeling future rather than a fantastic far off one. That and the techie is heavily inspired by the drone rigger, partially because what else would you do with a techie, but mostly because I just <i>knew</i> my girlfriend would want to have a robot friend in our games (quite a few things are in there for that reason).\n<blockquote><br/>There's no specific protocol.

DM'd and occasionally played RPGs (D&amp;D, EPT, AD&amp;D, CoC, TFT, Traveller) pretty much weekly from then until the mid to late 80's and then just kind of drifted off.<br/><br/>Discovered indie/story games by reading "Designers &amp; Dragons" (which I highly recommend) late last year.  Swung by Story Games Seattle earlier this year for my first experience playing them and plan on stopping by whenever I'm in the Seattle area.<br/><br/>I work in the LA area I've started a story games group at work with a similar style/focus as Story Games Seattle. We've met about half a dozen times and it feels like we are beginning to get a good core group built up.  So far we've played <b>Fiasco</b>, <b>The Final Girl</b>, <b>The Fall of Magic</b> and <b>The Quiet Year</b> with most of the other usual suspects on deck for future sessions.<br/><br/>All of my play is face to face right now.  Am on Roll20 as an experiment and may give that a try too though I far prefer face to face to online in most all interactions, including games.  So we'll see I guess.<br/><br/>Obviously there's a huge backlog of games I want to work through both with my story games group and outside of that.  Haven't played any PbtA games yet. I completely missed the whole White Wolf era and am interested in some of those, particularly <b>Orpheus</b>.  Also want to restart DM'ing some of the older RPGs like EPT, CoC and D&amp;D (though probably with a more up-to-date ruleset than my original AD&amp;D books).<br/><br/>My latest discovery is <b>Swords Without Master</b> and I'm hoping to organize a game in the near future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455610/#Comment_455610" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-16T00:30:19+00:00" title="August 16, 2016 12:30AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome, David!

I played a lot of various things until the mid-80s, when I mostly returned to my roots and dived into historical miniatures games. My HMG group occasionally does old, er classic, RPGs.  I turned out to like Fate, once Core came out, and started experimenting with more indie games when I went back to Gen Con in 2014 (having been once before...in 1980). So this year I came home with Microscope, The Quiet Year, and The Fall of Magic, and decided to go looking for the discussion zone appropriate to that sort of games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455683/#Comment_455683" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-19T17:21:24+00:00" title="August 19, 2016  5:21PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Rob!<br/><br/>North East!

I'm a teen librarian in South Florida with a keen love of history.  Was a big 40K player once upon a time and a desultory player of historicals and RPGs, but have been getting back into all three recently by introducing kids at work.  I've been running an intermittent DnD-esque campaign using variants of Tracy Hickman's XD20 recently, and have been thinking of running Lasers and Feelings (or a variant) at International Game @ Your Library Day in November - which is how I found myself here. XD20 really got me interested in low-complexity RPGs, since I love background books but don't have the time or memory to play most games.  So I've been gravitating towards games that can fit multiple themes, be held in the head and played on the fly.

I'm a Medical Technologist and have played RPGs since I was 12 (20 years now). I has always played traditional RPGs until I came across Fiasco and Microscope. These two games changed how I looked at roleplaying as a whole and now these types of games, along with OD&amp;D type "OSR" games have become mainstays in my house and with my groups. <br/><br/>I find these types of "Story Games" capture something most everyone remembers fondly from their childhood: Pretending! They are basically a structured type of pretending and I believe that is what makes them so fun.<br/><br/>I am glad to be a part of this community.

Thanks to all the space the shop affords us, we host a club called Ship's Log and we play a lot of rpgs.<br/><br/>I grew up with D&amp;D 2e, my parents have been playing with the same group of people since 1984, and so I often stick close to the warm comfort of dungeon crawler, sword and sorcery games. But lately, thanks to the club, I have been branching out into games that play well in short bursts and are drop in/new player friendly.<br/><br/>I'm very glad a friend pointed me in the direction of this community. Thanks in advance for all the amazing and helpful posts I'll read!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462193/#Comment_462193" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-20T13:01:44+00:00" title="April 20, 2017  1:01PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21071/welcome-re-introduce-yourself-2017#latest" rel="nofollow">here</a> instead!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16250/who-are-you-2012-2017/p5" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16250/who-are-you-2012-2017">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16250/who-are-you-2012-2017/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16250/who-are-you-2012-2017/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16250/who-are-you-2012-2017/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16250/who-are-you-2012-2017/p5" rel="prev">5</a><a class="Highlight p-6 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16250/who-are-you-2012-2017/p6">6</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed">This discussion has been closed.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
