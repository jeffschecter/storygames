                    So, today I ran Sorcerer combat for the first time.  We've had a number of sessions now and today things finally came to a head after the PC's (a young twentie's punk band lead guitarist, a mid-thirties scummy landlord, and an early forties ex-biker) knocked out the bad guy at a Beltane celebration and took him back to one of the landlord's tenant's flats (who's also a sorcerer, albeit not a very good one).  So then things got kindof confusing, with three players, three demons, the enemy, and his two demons.  Running combat involving nine characters and being responsible for the actions of six of them is not easy.  Things that happened include: punishing one of the demons multiple times to render her incapacitated, one of the PC's demons placing multiple Holds on the enemy, and the enemy's second demon stabbing a PC in the back then trying to escape out the fire escape, not to mention the enemy trying to break out of the Holds and the punished demon trying to recover from the Punish.  So, with lots of things going on, trying to figure out how the conflict resolution system works was really difficult.  I've played Sorcerer before and still didn't really understand it.  I've read Ron's explanations and they still didn't really clarify how it's supposed to work.  We eventually figured it out (I think) and conflict ran as smoothly as conflict involving nine participants can.  We eventually settled on:<br/>
1) stating actions<br/>
2) rolling attack dice at the beginning to determine the order of actions and the attack roll<br/>
3) going through the actions rolling defence or appropriate ability<br/>
4) and then assigning damage based ont he damage tables<br/>
5) Then the next round we would do the same thing, but figuring in any penalties based on damage or ability to move, or any other potential modifiers.  Sometimes we would drop dice from the ingured/incapacitated party, sometimes we would add dice to the victorious party, whichever made more sense for the action (or that would let everyone roll dice).<br/>
It certainly captured the chaos of battle very well.  We somehow even had enough dice.<br/>

                            Sounds like you did it right to me, Nancy. Multiple character conflict is indeed confusing as hell. Even when you know the system very well, there's a lot to keep track of.<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked at the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://random.average-bear.com/Sorcerer/HomePage" rel="nofollow">Sorcerer Wiki</a>? I browsed it a while back when I was thinking about running the game, and I remember that it reminded me of a few little details and generally made me feel more confident about the system.                        </div>

                            I hadn't looked at the wiki and it is indeed helpful.  I think we were mis-applying damage when we went through; we used it cumulatively rather than merely applying to the next roll, but we were at least consistent throughout the conflict.<br>

                            You know what would totally rock? A blow-by-blow animated example of Sorcerer complex conflict resolution like <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/Downloads/Capes%20Example1.swf" rel="nofollow">the one Tony has for Capes</a>.                        </div>
