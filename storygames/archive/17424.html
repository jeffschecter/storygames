Here's a blurb and a link!<br/><br/>"Campfire is a hack of A Thousand and One Nights: A Game of Enticing Stories by Meguey Baker. In Campfire, you play a group of high-school or college kids who go on a camping trip, as well as the characters in the scary stories they tell around the campfire, stories like those in horror anthologies such as Creepshow or Tales from the Darkside. In the tradition of slasher flicks, they will also try to satisfy their teenage desires for sex, drugs, and the approval of their peers. But beyond the light of the campfire, in the dark woods, lurks the enigmatic Slasher. In the end, only one of you will get out alive!"<br/><br/>Please download and enjoy! I would love to hear any and all feedback, or even just drop me a line to say that you played it!<br/><br/><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32462240/campfire_v4.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32462240/campfire_v4.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
