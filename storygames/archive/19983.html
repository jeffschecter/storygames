I feel like old <i>Vampire</i> is probably a toy, and I love it because so many of the doohickeys on it are well-suited for fun play.<br/><br/>In fact, I don't think it's quite accurate to call any RPG <i>a</i> toy.  A good, long, option-filled RPG book is more like a <i>box</i> of toys.  Another label I've used for such a book is "RPG tool kit".<br/><br/><b>So what is an RPG tool kit?</b>  (Or toy, or toy box?)  It's a chunk of material that can be played with in various different ways, constituting meaningfully different games and/or non-game modes of play.  By "meaningfully different" I mean having different goals, objectives, win conditions, formal rules, informal rules, and tests of skill.<br/><br/><b>How does that differ from a game?</b>  A game is a chunk of material that can be played with in various different ways within <i>one</i> consistent framework of goals, rules, and struggle.  Color, tone, pace, IC/OOC focus, level of participation, immediate character goals -- these can all vary from one group or session to the next, but the fundamental reason to play is constant.<br/><br/>(This definition isn't rigorously constructed.  Feel free to disagree with the premise in the comments, but please don't bog the discussion down by nit-picking my precise wording.  If you have better wording available, private message it to me and perhaps I'll use it.)<br/><br/><b>So, how is Call of Cthulhu a box of toys instead of a game?</b><br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu contains the following:<ul><li>Loads of Lovecraft material to inspire you to do Lovecraftian things.  What did Lovecraft protagonists do?  Alone, they stumbled upon something interesting, kept looking as more and more was revealed, got to some climactic revelation, and went mad.</li>\n<li>Rules for creating varied characters, and advice for running for groups.  No single protagonists expected.</li>\n<li>A system for keeping track of Sanity, including which experiences lower it, and what lowering it does to the character.</li>\n<li>Rules for resolving success or failure on various skilled tasks.</li>\n<li>Rules for resolving success or failure on various types of knowledge-hunting.</li>\n<li>An apparent expectation that the group, as led by the GM, will treat the fiction as plausible and causal with respect to when these rolls should be employed.  You can't shoot something that's out of range, you can't research if there's no library, etc.</li>\n<li>Advice and modules for the GM to use in providing collections of clues that comprise supernatural truths.</li>\n<li>Many monsters which will probably kill the PCs as soon as they appear, plus a few that won't, sometimes contingent on what the PCs have learned so far, but often not.</li></ul>\n<br/>So, what's the fundamental reason to play?  Various groups have come up with very different answers:<ol><li>Audience.  Witness the unfolding horrors.  No player participation required beyond deciding which door to open next.</li>\n<li>Portrayal.  Witness the horror and also add some dramatic reactions.</li>\n<li>Struggle.  Use your wits, acting ability, knowledge of physics, in-fiction strategy, rules mastery, and assets on the character sheet, in order to pursue a goal.<br/>3a) Attempt to discover the full truth of a secret.<br/>3b) Attempt to completely escape a death trap.<br/>3c) Attempt to vanquish a threat.</li>\n<li>Some GMs, sensing that one player wants to be audience, another player want to get their thespian on, and a third player wants to problem-solve, have tried to accommodate all three in the same game, taking turns between info-dumps, horror stimuli, and cleverness challenges.</li></ol>\nI think I have some more support for this assessment below, but fundamentally, this is why I view Call of Cthulhu as a box of toys.<br/><br/><b>How is that a good thing?</b><br/><br/>3+ games between two covers!  With the same awesome flavor available to all!  Flexibility to import bits from one game to another at will!<br/><br/><b>How is that a bad thing?</b><br/><br/>The book doesn't tell you what the 3+ options are, and it doesn't tell you which pieces to use in which ones, and it doesn't actually offer <i>full</i> support for all (any?) of them.<br/><br/>Or, to put it another way, if the audience isn't already sold on the "RPG as tool kit" model, and think instead they're buying a game in the sense that I defined above, like how a board game is a game, they're going to be really disoriented.<br/><br/>It's not just a matter of "you <i>can</i> decide on which pieces work for you" -- instead it's a matter of "you <i>have to</i> decide on which pieces work for you."  And it doesn't say that on the back cover of the book.<br/><br/>In my experience, there are two main results:<br/><br/>1) If you go to a con where it's mostly D&amp;D and Call of Cthulhu, the Call of Cthulhu games are the places to go for players who like acting and roleplay and adding to the mood.  The GMs vary, the adventures vary, but a large percentage of players who've continued to play Call of Cthulhu are the ones who can make it a fun experience regardless of the scenario's particulars.  Some of them think Portrayal is, in fact, the reason to play; others hold onto what drew them to Lovecraft in the first place, the horror vibe; and others have learned that many an aimless clue-hunt is spiced up by some emoting.<br/><br/>2) If you want meaningful decisions, skills and die rolls that matter, clues that add up, and/or dramatic pacing, it's time to cross your fingers and pray.  Even many "amazing CoC GMs" are extremely prone to filling up play time with "roll until you find the useless scrap of data in <i>this</i> location" drudgery; failing to signal when options are immaterial or dead-ends; haggling over minutiae with players who are seeking advantage where there's none to be had; and random TPKs without satisfying conclusions to arcs of discovery.  I've yet to actually meet a Call of Cthulhu GM who said, "Skill rolls are just for momentary color; you're here to portray your characters going mad as I show you cool horror stuff."  The "making a game out of the toys" process seems to be almost entirely unconscious, and is thus prone to all sorts of imported baggage.<br/><br/>If you look at Trail of Cthulhu, you can see that it's a reaction to this -- the way it handles clues and prep is targeted at eliminating clue-search drudgery, and the explicit Purist/Pulp division, while primarily a matter of color, may help groups nail down some starting assumptions.  Whether you think ToC is better or worse than CoC, I think its publication and continued existence speak to some distinct flaws in the older model -- as far as I can tell, it's basically selling on "exactly like Call of Cthulhu, but with some different rules!"<br/><br/><b>My takeaway:</b><br/>Even though I like toys, I find it very frustrating when a toy box comes labeled as a game and doesn't help me turn it into one.  To the extent that "that's not a game!" makes sense to me as an accusation, it's not a matter of design, but rather one of self-awareness.  If the makers of Call of Cthulhu acknowledged that they were selling a toy box, I can only imagine that it would be organized and introduced differently, the better to help seekers of Audience, Portrayal, Struggle, etc. hit upon the optimal tool usage.<br/><br/>(continued below -- last paragraph didn't fit)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441897/#Comment_441897" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T20:00:34+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  8:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2015 8:00PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not saying that, in the abstract, all toys should come with instructions to gamify them.

I think the issue you run into with this kind of RPG having instructions for pursuing specific uses is folks might feel limited to the choices you present and in my experience most groups are a broad mix and kind of cobble together whatever works for them. I wouldn't want to feel like I have to choose between playing three different versions of Cthulu for example, because I have developed my own way with the game and I am not sure it fits neatly into any particular category. I mean when we play a game like that there is strong investigative element, a strong element of exploration, an element of drama and also this kind of situational chemistry where things just arise organically from the combination of characters, the threat they face and how they respond to it.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441899/#Comment_441899" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T20:20:58+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  8:20PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2015 8:34PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would guess that that <i>does</i> fit into a particular category, but yeah, point taken on the "here are <i>the</i> three options" schema feeling limiting.

A frisbee is still fun even if it doesn't comes with the rules to ultimate frisbee.</blockquote>\nRight. But when a group plays with a frisbee, there's a negotiation about what that play will look like. As a toy, it implies that multiple modes of play are possible, and so the group must negotiate and select one. Sometimes, there might be disagreement about whether to play ultimate, or golf, or just play casually, but the conversation is easy to have because no correct mode of play is implied or assumed.<br/><br/>By presenting itself as a game, Call of Cthulhu preempts that negotiation. It implies a correct mode of play without stipulating it. So there's a lack of discussion about, but also a lack of imposition of the procedures and agenda of play.<br/><br/>There are a few outcomes of this:<br/><br/>(1) The group realizes and accepts that Call of Cthulhu, despite it's presentation, is a toy that supports multiple modes of play, and negotiates.<br/><br/>(2) The group naturally and implicitly agrees to play with CoC in the context of a specific, externally-imposed game. Sometimes the game is an ephemeral cultural artifact, sometimes it's concrete like a pre-generated module. <br/><br/>(3) The group does naturally agree on a mode of play, but, because of CoC's presentation, does not negotiate because they don't realize that multiple modes of play are possible. Expectations of play clash, and there's no clear venue for resolving that clash.<br/><br/>If, in case 3, the GM is aware of the clash, they might attempt to facilitate different types of play simultaneously. I've seen this work, but it's basically a band-aid measure to cover up the initial lack of negotiation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441906/#Comment_441906" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T21:50:06+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  9:50PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Dave!<br/><br/>I'd include this post in every CoC manual, personally.

So, I apologize that I didn't realize there was deeper context to the discussion than was stated in the OP.  (As a suggestion, maybe next time link to the parent thread?)<br/><br/>Also, you seem to be varying on what you're saying - first you say that Call of Cthulhu is a box of toys, then you say it's 3+ games in one book. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Personally, I can't say I've ever really had that much trouble with the game myself, having run a number of con games (which tend more towards Portrayal with some Struggle) and home campaigns (which tend to be mostly Struggle).  I can't say I'd ever thought of splitting the game up between Portrayal and Struggle myself, although I'll admit I've often thought that if a convention game of Call of Cthulhu doesn't end well at all (or with a total group kill) it's less of a bother if it's at least been an interesting death.  (But then, a total group kill in D&amp;D doesn't matter as much in a convention game, if it's interesting.)  <br/><br/>I'll admit I never have run across the "Audience" style of playing, which sounds a bit like reading a "Choose your own Adventure" book out loud.  Maybe I've missed it because I'm not interested in it, although (for home campaigns) it's probably because I'm often running the game.<br/><br/>Do you feel the same multi-game confusion with other rulesets for playing Cthulhu-themed adventures?  Call of Cthulhu D20, Trail of Cthulhu, Savage Worlds: Realms of Cthulhu, FUDGE?  I'm just wondering.  What about other horror games that are investigation based, as opposed to being the monsters that's been common over the last twenty or so years?<br/><br/>(And thank you for the example games.  Unfortunately, I've not played any of those, so it's not very helpful for the discussion, although I did watch the FIASCO episode(s) of Tabletop.  But I understand they used a lot of house rules in that game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441914/#Comment_441914" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T22:28:47+00:00" title="January 22, 2015 10:28PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As I was postulating in one of the earlier threads on this topic, I think almost all RPGs _ARE_ toys.

Are we there to act out madness, and struggle is the way to get there?  Or are we there to see if we can win, and the acting is there to add spice?  Disconnect over what's at stake is the problem I've run into, usually in the form of players expecting to influence outcomes more than they can (i.e. a real challenge to the players rather than just a fictional challenge to the characters).  My "Portrayal" mode isn't an attempt to say "thee's no acting in other modes" -- it's more to say that, in "Portrayal" mode there's no consequential player problem-solving, so the portrayal really is the whole deal (or, y'know, a big chunk of it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441943/#Comment_441943" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-23T14:45:10+00:00" title="January 23, 2015  2:45PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For me, game-ness is easiest to spot in something tightly structured and limited in scope.

In Call of Cthulhu, the universe itself is coded. The game, as such, is its index of sanity, but it\u2019s something \u2018beyond\u2019 too.

The game is depicting, or at least alluding to, the inexplicable \u2013 ie why is there <i>something</i> rather than <i>nothing</i> and why does it keep not making sense?<br/><br/>I like the taxonomies in the OP \u2013 I think I\u2019ve encountered every one of them.

Call of Cthulhu is a very subjective experience and making that experience collective is tricky \u2013 as the OP indicates.<br/><br/>There are several game agencies for rendering the portrayal of an individual\u2019s existential breakdown \u2013 the Sanity count alone is genius \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to make this game-wide and dramatize it without everyone sniggering and going gonzo. It\u2019s beyond language: <i>portrayal</i> is the only answer.

Call of Cthulhu is a very subjective experience and making that experience collective is tricky \u2013 as the OP indicates.<br/><br/>There are several game agencies for rendering the portrayal of an individual\u2019s existential breakdown \u2013 the Sanity count alone is genius \u2013 but <b>it\u2019s hard</b> to make this game-wide and dramatize it without everyone sniggering and going gonzo . . . <i>[emphasis mine -DB]</i></blockquote>Is it that hard?  Well, it's certainly hard if not everyone at the table wants to do it, or if they privately want to but haven't confirmed it, or if they've confirmed it but not at the outset when deciding how to play, or if they've confirmed it at the outset but aren't using rules that support it.<br/><br/>I dunno, I think this sort of challenge benefits from <i>more</i> game-ifying, at least to the extent of:<br/>- Introducing the clear goal to pursue a certain type of experience<br/>- Using procedures which create the best odds for such experiences to arise<br/><br/>It's true that the subjective experience itself isn't available for challenge, feedback, and reward, contrary to the performances demanded in most games.  However, I think portrayal provides a necessary* window into that experience, and portrayal <i>is</i> open to game interactions.<br/><br/>I <i>think</i> I addressed your point, but I'm not positive, so if I missed it, please clue me in!<br/><br/>*As long as we're doing Lovecraft multi-player, which is what Call of Cthulhu is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441994/#Comment_441994" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T10:58:02+00:00" title="January 25, 2015 10:58AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2015 4:51PM by summerdown.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So, what's the fundamental reason to play?

As a response, after my characters kept dying I would end up playing ever increasing weapons specialists in the hope of finally beating the damn thing.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, my fellow players were enjoying slowly turning mad and dying horribly.<br/><br/>I do wish sometimes, even if an RPG is to be a box of toys, that there would be a clear the air discussion before they begin about mood and tone, and expected play styles. Or even a one-page handout about how the players are expected to approach the material.

Literary criticism isn't just so we can get out of a novel what the critic got out of that novel -- it's more of a shot at growing our understanding, and then we do with that understanding what we will.  I mean, I'm sure I won't come up with all the approaches to Call of Cthulhu that other people might like, but perhaps a useful analysis of the game could help other people come up with their own approaches that I might never think of.<br/><br/>I'm not <i>sure</i> that "toy vs game" is useful analysis... but I do think your point about colloquial fuzz isn't the whole story.  Most critical terms carry some inappropriate baggage, and I'd say that their usability depends on whether they can be contextualized succinctly.  I think that's been more or less achieved here, right?  I mean, you may disagree, but I get the impression that you know what I'm trying to say by "game" and "toy".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442042/#Comment_442042" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T16:02:57+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  4:02PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>I think the point is that there are multiple approaches, and that can be a pro or a con.</blockquote>\nBut that doesn't make a game or a toy.

If it had simply been something more neutral like "Engines" versus "Systems" (which I think was a comparison someone mentioned as well at some point), I wouldn't have objected. George would be a stretch to find any issue with. Toy and Game, when you are talking within the context go a hobby where story gamer/indie game players and traditional players have had many bitter flamewars over things like whether a game ceases to be an RPG when it uses narrative mechanics or whether Trad. RPGs are are actual games at all (or at least if they are well designed), I think it isn't a stretch to question the use of the Game Versus Toy analogy. My other issue was on the value of thinking in terms of like analogies like this. Analogies can be useful if they help you explain something you already understand to other people who don't. But they are not good vehicles for arguments because you tend to get hung up debating the analogy itself.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442046/#Comment_442046" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T17:58:21+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  5:58PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are we sure this IS an "analogy"?

I think "engine" is somewhere in between -- less prone to misreading than "toy", but less accurately descriptive than "tool kit".  One could easily claim that the Call of Cthulhu book contains multiple engines.\n<blockquote><blockquote> the broad strokes are important (e.g. "Do our tactical decisions matter?" "Is the Big Evil Monster defeatable?" "Do we accept that the story should typically end with the protagonists going insane, or are we playing to try to avoid that?"), and all the players must be oriented towards them in some coherent fashion</blockquote>I am not so sure. I think that only happens if the group is walking around with these categories as conscious concepts in the first place.</blockquote>Agreed!  One of the possible benefits of looking at an RPG book as a box of tools is to broach the issue of "so what should we do with it?" in the first place, as opposed to assuming there's one right answer, board game-style.  Whether you parse the options the way I did depends on a number of things like personal experience, but I imagine "ways to combine these tools for particular ends" guidance from the book could be useful.\n<blockquote>we are directly comparing Trad RPGs to Toys and Indie RPGs to Games.</blockquote>No we aren't!

I wouldn't mistake that analogy for the reality of what I am dealing with, which is a book of rules and text.</blockquote>Hmm.  Can you think of any more succinct and literal way to say "book of rules and text which can be of use in various ways" than "tool kit"?  I mean, half the labels in modern English were metaphorical comparisons at one point, and became literal because they were the best description available.  I don't really see the point in your distinction.</blockquote>\nI don't think there is a problem with using the term here. But I do think it is important not to confuse tool kit RPG with a physical to kit, and that is where the distinction is important. I only mention this because I have seen so many RPG discussions where people start arguing about or discussing the features of the analogical object itself without realizing it. So even if the tool kit as an abstraction becomes its own term, it no longer is literally the same as a physical toolkit in that useage. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maleficum" title="Maleficum"><img alt="Maleficum" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maleficum">Maleficum</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442061/#Comment_442061" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T18:40:24+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  6:40PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I agree with the observations of the Opening Post(er), I want to make it clear that the Call of Cthulhu (CoC) book doesn't stand alone, actually far from it, in influencing CoC-roleplayers. CoC 5th ed. was the first RPG Book I read, and my fist game was as a keeper for two experienced players. The "try and accomplish or solve stuff"-influence is giving roleplayers, but it doesn't neccesarily come from the CoC-book. I think few (less than half) who play CoC have ever looked in the book*, even less at conventions.  <br/><br/>I've just started reading Trail of Cthulhu now, after a CoC-game at a convention rekindled my mythos fire and and gave me hopes that it can be played "purist style" (albeit in  "multi-player Lovecraft"-mode). As I've mainly played CoC diceless with a combined forcus on horror theme/acting, while following a narrative** , and watched it fall together as one roll to "speak french" or "hit stuff with shotgun", whenever an inexperienced (CoC-)GM let slip the reins of the narrative, and by it the theme and mood.<br/><br/>I'll reiterate my main point: Players approaching Call (/Trail) of Cthulhu with another agenda than "portray a role, while making it slowly loose a grip (on reality as hir knows it) and enjoy the narrative" have probably their influence made from other RPGs (possibly including computer one's). <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* except to look up the stats for Cthulhu<br/>** CoC is really the only game I care to follow a narrative                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442065/#Comment_442065" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T18:49:05+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  6:49PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't want to be pedantic here...</blockquote>\nToooooooooooooooooooo late.<br/><br/>Actually, my little drama *wasn't* about your comments in *this* thread, but you have certainly contributed to the social process I'm complaining about, with your thin-skinned hyper-reflexive defensiveness to anything that even sounds like it could possibly vaguely have something to do with the usual flamebait. The logical extension of the kinds of objections that you raise, and those raised by Usual Suspect Corley (but at least he's good-natured about it!), is to simply not develop any lexicon at all for discussing RPGs, because someone somewhere might infer that the chosen terminology had a hidden undercurrent of disparagement.<br/><br/>The substantive observation at hand is: some products-that-are-marketed-as-roleplaying-games tell the users exactly how to use them, what creative decisions to make at each step, and in general, what play using that product should look and feel like. Whereas other such products, including CoC, require one or more of the users to take the product, and then make higher-level decisions about what sorts of creative inputs will be required, how scenes will be framed, and other matters of aesthetic import, during the group's use of that product.<br/><br/>Whatever words we use to describe the differences between those two things, someone, somewhere, will find them offensive or pejorative. Is "toy" versus "game" the best of all possible taxonomies? Probably not, but it's utterly worthless to look for better ones, because the same exact objections will be raised again and again by the same derailers.                        </div>\n<div

I completely agree that most of the "try and accomplish or solve stuff" impetus originates elsewhere rather than from the CoC book.  However, I think that the facilitator/book-owner/keeper generally acts as an approval gate for "what outside stuff players can bring to the table".  Accordingly, I don't think it's too much to ask that the book tell its reader "portray a role, go nuts, enjoy the narrative" (if that's the goal) so the reader can pass that on to their group.  <br/><br/>I also think that the presence of the Basic Roleplay skill system, which is in fact inherited from "try and accomplish or solve stuff" RPGs, leads many facilitators/book-owners/keepers down the familiar "try and accomplish or solve stuff" path.  I assume this is from the publisher, Chaosium, keeping things familiar so that people who play one of their games can easily play another without having to learn systems from scratch.  <br/><br/>If I'm wrong, though, please correct me -- I have not seen 5th edition, and if they changed what kind of stuff is on the skill list, ditched the yes/no percentile rolls, or provided really clear instruction about how this stuff is just for randomized color and not for fate-altering consequence, then my objections would no longer stand.  I'm happy to have my character fail at stuff as long as the GM knows how to use that failure to keep pushing the madness and discovery forward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442071/#Comment_442071" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T19:20:29+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  7:20PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2015 7:31PM by catty_big.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> I'm interested in the discussion but have shied away from commenting so far as the thread has blossomed and flowered, but I've just started reading through the posts, and I realise that when you say 'toy' you mean 'tool-kit'. Is that right? In which case not only am I totally with you, but also I think that whether or not a specific RPG (I can't see if it's been mentioned already but I'd almost put <i>Savage Worlds</i> in that category) is more of a tool-kit than a game is a live one. I'd imagine a lot of people would dismiss tool-kit games as not fully developed, or worse, a design cop-out, but I'm definitely of the opinion that such games are actually to be lauded because 1) they're endlessly re-playable, since every game you play is (potentially) different in style and tone to the last (and it now occurs to me that <i> Microscope</i> is probably the best modern example of a tool-kit game), and 2) while writing the previous bit I forgot what (2) was, so I'll just have to leave you with (1). That's my two penn'orth so far - I'll now read through the rest of the responses to see if there isn't some more I can tease out of the topic.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442072/#Comment_442072" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T19:37:52+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  7:37PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2015 7:44PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think it's often impossible to know whether a tool-kit RPG book is a design cop-out or the <i>perfect</i> design decision -- it depends on what the designers were going for.

A game that I buy and enjoy, might to me seem totally adequate with its instructions, but I can see someone else feeling it is missing something essential. So I can't think of a particular instance where I consciously thought a game was better for not including something, though I may have felt it had a "light build" and didn't intrude into the flow of play. \n<blockquote><br/>2. Tell us about a time when you bought an RPG which had a very thoroughly-designed procedure/advice/techniques (like a boardgame), and it hurt your play/your enjoyment of the game.</blockquote>\nFor me it the one time this really stood out, was with Gumshoe (technically it was Essoterrorist that I read and ran). Granted the advice was easy enough to ignore. But when I ran it, I made an effort to follow the the spirit and text of the game so I was getting the experience intended by Laws. I think it is a great game for a certain style of play and I quite like some of the elements to it (for example there is something to be said for not always rolling skills). This was nearly two years ago so forgive me if my details are a bit murky at this point. I just have my own way of approaching investigations, and for me I don't think of them in terms of scenes, so I found my style clashing with the one presented in the book (which saw clues leading from one scene to the next). I always treat investigations more as open sandboxes and I am okay with the players not succeeding at them. So the game had all these procedures and guidelines (i'd say it was mainly guidelines and mechanical structure than actual procedures) that were designed to answer problems I never really had with this kind of adventure. <br/><br/>I have to say, I enjoyed reading the book a lot. I think Laws is a great writer. And I loved, loved the concept of the game. I also could see, because I've encountered plenty of GMs who did have the problem Laws wanted to address, that the game was going to work for a certain segment of the hobby and fulfilled that goal well. It just wasn't quite for me and some of the things in there tripped me up, didn't gel with my natural way of conducting a game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442087/#Comment_442087" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T01:19:25+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  1:19AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just glad we concluded from this thread that chess isn't a game.

Most people use a chess board to play chess without any negotiating of how it will be used. You can use it for something else, just like you could use a laptop as a coaster or a bludgeoning instrument, but chess boards are designed with the intent that they'll be used to play chess, and I think 99% of people who pick up a chess board, use it toward that end. Negotiating play for chess, seems the exception rather than the rule.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442091/#Comment_442091" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T02:02:27+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  2:02AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2015 2:04AM by Dirk.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most likely, if you have the board out, then you've already negotiated that chess will be played, and what that means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442092/#Comment_442092" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T02:08:07+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  2:08AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Most likely, if you have the board out, then you've already negotiated that chess will be played, and what that means.</blockquote>\nBut that doesn't seem to be what you were saying before. t guess there is always a discussion prior to doing anything on whether you'll be doing it or doing something else, but I still don't think negotiation is an part of the standard procedure of playing chess (which seemed to be your point before). It seems quite obvious almost everyone uses a chess set to play chess with no question that it will be employed in some other way. I think we all intuitively understand we could use the chess set to pelt each other with pawns and rooks, then fight for control of the board, but most people would see doing that as deviating from the function of the game board and pieces. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442094/#Comment_442094" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T03:36:12+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  3:36AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2015 3:36AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to request that there be no further mention of chess in this thread.

Was it something which ultimately made you abandon the game (because it was too inflexible, or some other reason), or was it a simple matter of deciding to ignore his advice and to play it the way you wanted to in the first place?<br/><br/>In other words: would you rather have bought a copy of his Esoterrorists book <i>without</i> that particular advice (or procedures)? Would that have led to a better gaming experience for you, or not?<br/><br/>(See, they are ultimately the same question in my mind.)<br/><br/>But if you feel this doesn't belong, I'll step back!

Was it something which ultimately made you abandon the game (because it was too inflexible, or some other reason), or was it a simple matter of deciding to ignore his advice and to play it the way you wanted to in the first place?</blockquote>\nWell, I think the effect it had, was it made much of the book not feel all that useful for my purposes. There is finite space and it ultimately makes it a less attractive option than a book that uses that space differently. That said the advice itself was easy enough to ignore. The problem in this case was the mechanics and advice were tied together enough, that even without the advice, some of the rules themselves were a bit of an impediment to our style. \n<blockquote><br/>In other words: would you rather have bought a copy of his Esoterrorists book <i>without</i> that particular advice (or procedures)? Would that have led to a better gaming experience for you, or not?<br/></blockquote>\nI think the possibility of us re-using the game would have been stronger without that advice or if had different advice that suited our approach better. <br/><br/>I do think the advice shapes expectations and sets the stage. I also know I've played games whose advice I've entirely ignored and been fine with it. With advice like this in a game book if it hits your sweet spot it can make the book more attractive, if the advice is something that really turns you off then it can potentially make you avoid a game that might otherwise be appealing. Another possibility is the advice simply confuses rather than illuminates if it isn't on your wave length. So I think it is probably hard to come up with a concrete answer here on whether it is always going to be a positive or negative to include X in a book. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442123/#Comment_442123" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T15:57:30+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  3:57PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It remains fascinating to me that so many people are willing to completely SHRED the rules of games they LIKE and rebuild them in their image, and yet feel that some advice on how you should do something can completely ruin a game for them.<br/><br/>It almost seems like people like being contrary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442124/#Comment_442124" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T16:18:31+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  4:18PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It remains fascinating to me that so many people are willing to completely SHRED the rules of games they LIKE and rebuild them in their image, and yet feel that some advice on how you should do something can completely ruin a game for them.<br/><br/>It almost seems like people like being contrary.</blockquote>\nMy attitude with rules in general is I prefer to run games as closely to the RAW as possible, only deviating from that when the mechanics themselves produce an outcome that is not plausible for the particular situation, or when the mechanics themselves don't deal adequately with the situation. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442125/#Comment_442125" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T16:24:03+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  4:24PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It remains fascinating to me that so many people are willing to completely SHRED the rules of games they LIKE and rebuild them in their image, and yet feel that some advice on how you should do something can completely ruin a game for them.<br/><br/>It almost seems like people like being contrary.</blockquote>\nOne thing to keep in mind here is people often look to the advice and guidelines as a kind of mission statement of the designers. so it people will often abandon the game before knowing whether they like the system or not because they use the advice as a way of gauging the overall intentions of the designers. Generally if you disagree with the advice, you might see that as a sign that the game simply wasn't designed with your preferences in mind, whereas if the advice is on the same page as you, it is going to make you approach the system more optimistically. <br/><br/>Mechanics are different because they can be more easily viewed in more neutral terms I think. Not always the case though. I know people who won't touch a game if it has bennies or hero points for example But generally speaking, if you don't like a mechanic and want to change it, I suppose lots of people feel comfortable. But if you don't like the spirit of the game (which is what the advice and guidelines often explains) then there is more of an emotional reaction to it. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442127/#Comment_442127" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T21:05:32+00:00" title="January 27, 2015  9:05PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2015 9:15PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>One thing to keep in mind here is people often look to the advice and guidelines as a kind of mission statement of the designers.</blockquote>That is really interesting!  I've read plenty of RPG book flavor in my day -- yay White Wolf! -- but I always tended to skim through the advice.  I wanted to be told how to play in succinct bullet points that were easy to find and parse quickly -- pages and pages of full paragraphs just pissed me off.  I think the advice I read most of was the advice that was actually mixed in with the flavor and fiction... but that stuff was hard for me to find, use, or remember.  The idea that I could look at an RPG book's advice section and get a good sense of its spirit is foreign to me -- it seems too labor-intensive and murky.  Which advice?  Where?  Do they mean it?

The point is guidelines can shape people's expectations of play and they have the power to attract and repel (and yes they absolutely can be ignored). Lots of people played vampire despite the advice, many played because of it, but it is also true that for for many 'storyteller' is synonymous with railroad and I know lots of players who simply won't play the game as a result. There are also people who ft it promised a lot and never delivered. You still see it brought up in discussions all the time for this reason. <br/><br/>I am just mentioning to point out when someone is willing to completely change mechanics in a game to taste but is unwilling to play because of the game's spirit, I don't think that is a contradiction (or a sign folks are trying to be contrarian) because advice and guideline often get a stronger emotional reaction for some folks than mechanics.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442137/#Comment_442137" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T22:16:37+00:00" title="January 27, 2015 10:16PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On that note, I wonder if the Call of Cthulhu book is smart in offering guidance that people can parse how they want, as opposed to some clear mission statement of a one right way to play.

It actually emphasizes that the supernatural elements are so dangerous players are not advices to go in shooting or fighting, but should instead investigate. So the advice and the mechanics (provided I remember play well enough) seem pretty in line with one another (at least from a cursory reading of the intro chapter). Essentially what it is doing is making combat lethal (both in terms of physical danger but also in terms of going insane to the point your character isn't playable) so the players avoid it and instead focus on information gathering and clever play. In my experience this works quite well. I've done two investigation heavy RPGs and the thing that really helps keep the focus on investigation is making fast and lethal combats. <br/><br/>I don't know that I would call it a clear mission statement, because you can kind of read a lot into what they say in the introduction. Still investigating supernatural horror is narrow enough for my tastes. I think that might be for the best since it seems like a lot of people come to Cthulu with their own approach.<br/><br/>My experience with cthulu (and again it has been a while) is eventually things catch up to the players and going characters tend to meet ends in keeping with the spirit of love craft (though maybe me and my friends were just more aggressive in how we approached the game). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442142/#Comment_442142" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T23:00:01+00:00" title="January 27, 2015 11:00PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone once told me that <i>every</i> RPG is an investigation game.
