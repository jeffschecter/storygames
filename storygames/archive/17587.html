However, what if I want to transition to a political intrigue sort of game?<br/><br/>Strings, in my opinion, are the strongest relationship mechanic in any of the *W hacks, if not some of the best relationship mechanics of any game. How would replacing Bonds with Strings affect DW? What other mechanics would need to be altered? Definitely some Move equivalents of Turn Someone On and Shut Someone Down as well as adding strings with Hack and Slash to mimic Lash Out Violently.<br/><br/>With Strings, characters could constantly be shifting favor/rapport with themselves, NPC's, or even factions in the setting. Getting information and using as blackmail is definitely a String mechanic, not a Bond one.<br/><br/>Anything else need to be changed to make this work?

They're ways for the PCs to mess with each other.<br/><br/>In a DW game, where the PCs are mostly working together, I think you'd need to expand strings so that they also encompassed Aid and Defend as well.<br/><br/>Also, when you add in strings, you really change the nature of the game. The melodrama between PCs is emphasized dramatically. You end up with something less dungeon crawly and more Legend Of The Seeker or Merlin or something more inter-character focused like that.<br/><br/>You need to make sure that's what you want the game to focus on, if you're going to give the players that many tools to focus on that.<br/><br/>I've been pondering a rather extensive hack that would do just that. Once I started playing with the idea, I realized it wasn't anywhere near as simple as I'd originally thought. If you look at Monsterhearts, it works because strings are subtly woven through all the playbooks in clever ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398775/#Comment_398775" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-26T15:16:24+00:00" title="November 26, 2012  3:16PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2012 3:17PM by John_Harper.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, if you want to play a game of political intrigue, Dungeon World is a pretty poor choice.

I've heard of it, but haven't really had the opportunity to check it out with all the other games I've been meaning to get to first.<br/><br/>I'm still wondering about the Strings though. I may be wrong, but I think they could be used to measure political leverage. Sort of a Godfather "you owe me a favor" kind of thing. I understand in their current setting, they are used more to fuck with each other in any way possible. But in a fantasy setting, things may be different. <br/><br/>I understand other mechanics would have to be introduced to foster the play style. Maybe introduce Keys, giving each character a personal ambition. The Strings, or leverage, could be used as reverse strings. You offer another character the opportunity to take an action by spending a string, they gain XP if they follow through. You offer another character the opportunity to change their convictions by spending X strings, they take a Key and gain XP when they hit it. <br/><br/>Players taking and giving each other XP. I kind of like that idea. I think it also creates a meta-game level sort of politics.....It'd still be focused on NPC's and Factions, but would work with other PC's.<br/><br/>Maybe other things can be tacked on for additional effect. Assets like rank, title, wealth, holdings, etc. and things to increase Scale. Just ideas. But they are all still based around the Strings. I would definitely use World of Dungeons as the base, as opposed to DW proper in order to maintain some simplicity.<br/><br/>To sum up, "Turn Someone On" = "Gain Leverage" in a fantasy setting (but as we've seen in GoT, there's plenty of "turning on" as well). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398892/#Comment_398892" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T13:39:23+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  1:39PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Are there any other story games out there can be used to model a Game of Thrones-esque game? </blockquote>\nI've got some good notes for a Game of Thrones Lady Blackbird hack... <br/>(bonus, there's a ship called the Blackbird that gets mentioned in the latest book)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398894/#Comment_398894" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T13:45:16+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  1:45PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you could use Strings to model political leverage.

Like, a Bond is a relationship you've got with someone that's fairly (but not totally) static, whereas Strings change: one moment you've got the advantage, another moment the other does, the next you're both heavily entangled, the next neither of you is really interested in the other at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398988/#Comment_398988" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T07:48:17+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  7:48AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, as much as I love DW, if you really want a game of political intrigue it's not the place to start. Who cares how many coins and swords your guy can carry if the game is all about the political maneuvering going on?<br/><br/>Sagas, on the other hand, is actually a kind of great start now that I think on it. You'd need new playbooks for sure, but the basic structure of the game is much more in line with something Game of Thrones-esque.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
