I was struck by what I was reading last night and it touches on a topic I haven't really seen discussed specifically yet. <br/><br/>To what extent is being ready to bare things that might be personal and possibly sensitive required to make our play great?<br/><br/>In Stein on Writing, Stein talks about something he calls "snapshots". A snapshot is the expression of something we'd much rather keep private and hidden. Stein calls it a snapshot because it's meant to be a very tangible, accessible image of some private thing. <br/><br/>Here's the example he gives: Stein was working with a woman who was writing a novel where her main character does very dangerous police work. But the novel wasn't really getting to awesome. The lead character wasn't grabbing readers. Stein talked to the author about her own experiences. It turned out that she had herself done some dangerous police work. She admitted that every night as she went out late to her work, she would pat her sleeping two year old on her head. It was a very private moment, and one the author did not want to reveal. But when she put that detail into the novel, the rest of the story became much more personal. It got to awesome.<br/><br/>So in this case the author needed to reveal something personal in order to get from "pretty good" to "awesome!" I think I can see a bit of this happening in my own gaming and game-mastering. Does anyone else see this in their gaming? Do you think that being ready to take personal risks, to be vulnerable, might make you a better gamer?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62308/#Comment_62308" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T16:13:27+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  4:13PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell, yes!  I just finished that book.  Stein is the man. <br/><br/>The whole Snapshot thing really resonated with me.  There are places in writing and in playing that I avoid because they strike close to home and are emotional.  Deep emotion that is out there in front of everyone is scary.  Stein said that every writer should have a snapshot in their head and when writing should keep in touch with that emotion because that is what gives a writer a unique voice.<br/><br/>I did my own snapshot on <a href="http://kairoscreative.wordpress.com/2007/03/20/writing-exercise-finding-your-voice/" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62310/#Comment_62310" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T16:54:41+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  4:54PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thought...certainly action for action's sake has less of a zing than when there's something serious at stake...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62325/#Comment_62325" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T21:35:17+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  9:35PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Tony,<br/><br/><span style="color: red;">Does anyone else see this in their gaming?

Most players describe exotic pornographic events on their turn, in a way that keeps them personally distant from the narrative. But often one player will base events on personal fantasies, producing a palpably more compelling narrative. This raises the bar for the other players. They know they're being out-played. And maybe they don't consciously realize what the more effective player is doing. But somehow unconsciously many do, when motivated by being out-played, because they invariably arrive at the same method.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I think that's a bit too loose of a discussion. I don't need to reveal anything personal to defeat the dungeon. I know you understand that, I just wanted to make the statement so it was clear what type of gaming we're talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in the type of gaming you seem to be interested in, based on your game designs, that revelation could be helpful to achieve the type of game you are looking for, which seems to me to be a kind of game that is being used to poke at dilemma's moral and otherwise. For that then I think it's likely to be helpful to reach for experience, or desire, as a safe way to explore things. I could also see how this kind of game could crash from the same thing by grossly exceeding someone's line, or receiving feedback that a person is not ready to accept. The problem this could lead to is that this could cause some serious resentment on multiple fronts. Here's an example where everything worked out alright, but you can see how perhaps with different folks it may not have. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16552.msg175953" rel="nofollow">Deconstructing Dogs.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI also think that approaching this type of game with the thought, "I need to pull from the hidden space," too strongly could possibly lead to perhaps making a mistake and revealing things you don't mean to. If you are deliberately exceeding your boundaries, you can't take that back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my answer to your question then is; I think some of the gaming that will be most meaningful to us is when we are dealing with things that we want to address but can't, due to cultural constraints, fear, or because we just haven't had time to deal with it. This is probably why the unnamed female authors book moved from blah, to awesome. There's a vulnerability expressed in her changes that the audience can identify with that's out of character for the personification of someone who engages in dangerous police work. Someone who engages in dangerous police work has to face the world as someone who is tough, and brave, not someone fearful like the rest of us. It's how we feel the authors story is real because we know on some level, conscious or unconscious, we would be afraid. I would say that realness transfers to collaborative story-gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
