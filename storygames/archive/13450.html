Very excited for our upcoming game.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have a couple rules questions while running through the book I was hoping Halfjack or someone could help answer.<br/><br/>1. How do defensive beams work in the beam phase of starship combat?  My confusion stems from page 147 and this sentence: "A roll with no modification is made to oppose all incoming Beam attacks. Ships may have a Stunt (Vector Randomizer) that changes the base from 0 to 2."  <br/><br/>That sentence seems definitive, but my gut is telling me that it simply implies if you do not have a beam weapons stat on your ship you can still defend with an unmodified opposed roll.  If you do have beam weapons, however, can you fire defensive beams as a defense against a beam attack (I know you can against torpedoes)?  This seems a little unclear to me.<br/><br/>2. Social Combat: Characters may not use the same skill twice in a row - does this include skills used in defensive actions as well as across turns? (page 179)  Basically, I'm asking what does "in a row" mean.<br/><br/>3.  Platoon Combat: If a unit separated from its Platoon takes a consequence and later recombines with a Platoon, is that consequence erased and effectively healed?<br/><br/>4. Platoon Combat: Since Infantry don't have a movement stat, do you still roll a movement roll (with 0 modifier) to attempt to move past a boundary such as a low wall?  Or, can the infantry not move past boundaries?<br/><br/>Thanks for the help in advance, I appreciate it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/drnuncheon" title="drnuncheon"><img alt="drnuncheon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/drnuncheon">drnuncheon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303294/#Comment_303294" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T09:04:01+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  9:04AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Defensive beams only help out vs. torpedoes - the only effect they have on the beam phase is determine how much capacity you can use without gaining heat. You always get a defense roll against beams, but the stunt is the only thing that alters it.<br/><br/>2. I believe this is mean to be you can't "attack" with the same skill twice in a row.<br/><br/>I haven't needed the platoon combat yet so I haven't read that carefully enough to answer 3 and 4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303322/#Comment_303322" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T13:03:23+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  1:03PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            drnuncheon pegged 1.<br/><br/>For 2 we actually intend that you can't use the same skill twice in a row regardless of context. This makes your skills a kind of resource (if you use your best skill defensively, you won't be able to use it offensively).<br/><br/>For 3 no, the platoon now has the consequence.<br/><br/>For 4 yes, roll against zero.<br/><br/>And please feel free to ask away about anything! You may find a more focused group of Diaspora  players in the Diaspora mailing list, the FATE mailing list, or the RPGGeek.com Diaspora forums. In the forums there is of course also a record of questions previously asked, which can be handy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303345/#Comment_303345" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-05T19:06:20+00:00" title="December  5, 2010  7:06PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Brad and Jeff, answers cleared everything up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
