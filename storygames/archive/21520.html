The idea is that the TV series stuff starts around the edges of the scenario stuff, but slowly you get a bleed between the levels of fiction as the production calamity level rises. I've seen some great stuff in con games, like a recurring stuntman who somehow ended up as the actor's nemesis, so of course ended up playing the big bad at the end of the game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470651/#Comment_470651" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-14T02:09:54+00:00" title="March 14, 2018  2:09AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dear Matt, it's a very cool game, it has some potential for being a Prime Time Adventures replacement for me, since the wacky meta game stuff was always one of my favorite aspects of PTA.  <br/>Do you have any suggestions for hacking it to a different 70's game, if the players are more excited about playing their own cut-rate version "The Men from Uncle" or "Bionic Man" or "Mission: Impossible" instead of the (admitted very cool) Elizabethan spy show? You could even make the lost predecessor to "Xena: Warrior Princess" for cheap swords-and-sandals action. To me it doesn't seem like you'd need much but different character write-ups since it's pretty abstract, but I'd like your input.  <br/><br/>By the way, if it's successful, a book of additional 70's shows with premises, sample characters and and episode guide would be a great companion piece.  There are lots of lazy GMs out there and I'm one of them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470688/#Comment_470688" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T22:40:53+00:00" title="March 15, 2018 10:40PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks! <br/><br/>Yep, you shouldn't have a problem going for a more generic 60s/70s thing. That's essentially what The Agency (the system it's based on) was originally conceived for. <br/><br/>What The Queen's Men adds is essentially more detail in the meta-layer framing, so the actor failure, commentary and production level director bonuses. All of those can be applied equally as techniques in a more "Man from UNCLE" setup. <br/><br/>What I would say is that the framing stuff you get in the episode guides and actors would be something you'd need to create and fit to the tone. It's all there to get people thinking in the right frame of reference for that kind of 70s TV and its production mishaps, so for your own series that'd be where you'd want to focus some time. The "your Own Episodes" section covers this to some degree.<br/><br/>I'd love to do a supplement along those lines. We shall see!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
