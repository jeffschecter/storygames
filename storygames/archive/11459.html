This seems obvious, I think, once you start looking for it.<br/><br/>However, Qualitative Karma is also evident in things that are not clearly resolution.<br/><br/>For example, how do you determine whether someone has made a good enough Raise in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>? A Raise has to meet certain descriptive requirements, such as being something that the opposing side cannot ignore. And I would argue that this kind of determining is based on comparing a given Raise with the necessary requirements, qualitatively.  Judging what kind of resource is refreshed after an interlude scene in Bliss Stage is similar.<br/><br/>This is also related somewhat to Vincent's discussion of "fictional positioning," but is somewhat more general.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I said, more thoughts tomorrow, after some sleep.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt

Thank you. <br/><br/>The obvious objection now arising in my brain is that, while quantitative karma can be simply compared on a (most likely) numerical scale, qualitative karma is  subjective. The subjectivity of comparison is so great that there are no guarantees that two players are even discussing the subject with the same objective in mind; one might be making the comparison on the basis of progressing a narrative, the other on basis of making an allegoric point. <br/><br/>If we compare the <i>quality</i> of, say, strength (as opposed to the quantity of strength), we must first establish the criteria for judgment otherwise the comparison devolves into meaningless assertions. Of course, this could be sidestepped by players agreeing on the <i>why</i> of their conflict before they settle on the <i>how</i>.  <br/><br/>It's felicific calculus all over again! We'll end up judging the quality of actions by their intensity, duration, propinquity, certainty, extend, fecundity and purity in relation to the plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255301/#Comment_255301" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T06:53:08+00:00" title="February  6, 2010  6:53AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2010 10:44AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (not relevant, sorry)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255303/#Comment_255303" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T07:05:59+00:00" title="February  6, 2010  7:05AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The DFK terminology breaks down when you start considering things like this. It's simply not made for this sort of thing, the notion only applies to a pretty traditional conception of resolution. Even the concept of qualitative Karma in the narrow sense Jonathan postulates first is a bit suspect - Karma in the original sense is Karma because the qualitative judgment has been made a priori in choosing the engage in resolution with these particular mechanical bits, and the Karma itself happens objectively. Jonathan's subjective Karma requires a subjective (perhaps very easy and consensual, but subjective nonetheless) evaluation of the fiction to be pulled off. In this regard I'd call it a clear case of Drama resolution insofar as Drama is understood to be any resolution that directly references the fiction and not just resolutions made out of dramatist concerns.<br/><br/>(I should note that the whole DFK terminology is rather dated, if you disagree with me on the above I don't really care that much.)<br/><br/>Putting that aside, even if we accept the idea of qualitative Karma, using the term for something outside resolution procedures just doesn't make any sense to me - when Karma only exists in relation to the resolution, what does it mean that something "is Karma" when there is no resolution going on? Better perhaps to say that qualitative judgments are made in many places in roleplaying games. This is certainly true - when you stop to think about it, a qualitative evaluation of "is this thing this way" is a fundamental requirement for the SIS to make an appearance: the players need to be able to agree on whether a character is inside or outside a house, for instance, and that requires a qualitative judgment, just like picking the appropriate ability for an ability check does or finding out whether the character is in fact wearing what should be considered a helmet. Whether any of this is of any interest or practical use is another matter, as this is so very basic to the very act of roleplaying - perhaps Jonathan will tell us more?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255312/#Comment_255312" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T10:18:44+00:00" title="February  6, 2010 10:18AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Eero,</p>\n<p>Personally I'm always a little hazy on when and where resolution happens in an RPG.</p>\n<p>Certainly there are moments of it that are obvious.

Let me see if I be clearer about what I'm trying to say.<br/><br/>First I guess, it may help to say why I think this is important. In "structured freeform" design work of various types (including the freeform components of games that also have Fortune resolution in them somewhere), there are a couple of major building blocks of mechanical design that I see.  One is what you might call "constrained moves," where the game offers players a number of highly restricted options with different mechanical outcomes and you choose between them. The other chief one, in my mind, is what I'm trying to get at here with "qualitiative Karma," mechanics that require players to qualitatively compare the descriptions (whether formalized as "traits" or not) of different in-game things (characters, locations, etc.)<br/><br/>I would also assert, though I haven't fully thought this out, that it's more difficult to build formalized mechanics out of Drama revolution in the specific sense that Tweet originally means when he says: "the needs of the plot determine... the outcome" (Everway PG, 125).  I don't really see that as the foundation or building block of more complex forms of resolution. You just have one or more players consider the plot and make a rather subjective decision about what is needed or seems the best for the overall narrative. However, in my mind, this idea of "qualitative Karma," specific instances where the game mechanics ask you to compare the descriptions of different aspects of the game, CAN be a building block of more complex mechanics, and I suspect that our conversations about different "freeform" mechanics might strongly benefit from having a term like "qualitiative Karma" to throw around.  But, clearly, if nobody likes it but me, I'm mostly going to be talking to myself.<br/><br/>Thing is, in my original post, I'm really talking about a couple of different things.  The first is:<br/><br/>1) Karma resolution that involves comparing qualitative descriptions of aspects of the game ("Sampson is mighty fast" and "Gerda moves like lightning," say) rather than quantitative descriptions of the same aspects ("Gerda has Speed 5; Sampson has Speed 4"). Fudge was trying to get at this, right? But in Fudge the qualitative descriptions ("Gerda has Terrific Speed; Sampson has Great Speed") have a fixed hierarchy of potency, so the players aren't actually required to make qualitative judgments (and, therefore, that's not what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>2) The second thing (like the Dogs and Bliss Stage examples) is more what Eero is just calling "qualitative judgments" which everyone may not agree still involve resolution (I would consider it resolution, but that's not really the point). A good comparison might be rolling for damage. Is that Fortune resolution? It "resolves" the question of how much your weapon hurts the enemy; it establishes something in the SIS (which is the Forge Glossary definition of resolution). But that requires you to buy into a perspective where almost EVERYTHING is resolution, and that may not work for some folks.<br/><br/>One of the main examples John and I were talking about were the mechanics involved in GMing <i>Apocalypse World</i>, so maybe that'll be a useful point of reference for folks who've read or played it.  I haven't done either, so I'll give a few examples, based on talking about it with John, and then quit before I overstate myself.  But Vincent tells the GM to set up various ongoing plots and subplots and then incrementally advance them over time. John said something about the GM being able to do terrible things to the players "if one of the GM's plots comes to fruition without being opposed." That, in my mind, is a qualitative judgment clearly specified as a rules mechanic (whether it's "resolution" or not, eh, I'm agnostic). But I am really excited by these kinds of formalized, measured judgments (not arbitrary or totally subjective, as they are based on explicit guidelines) being used as the building blocks of more complex systems, many of which are ultimately still "freeform" or a least don't involve Fortune.<br/><br/>Because, I mean, the mechanic could be: "Any time you attempt to advance the plot, make X roll.  If you get Y outcome, increment the clock."  Basically, it could be a quantitative countdown mechanic like MLWM / Polaris / Breaking the Ice / etc.  But no, instead it's a qualitative "timer," where conditions advance until they reach a certain qualitative description and the game trusts the players to be able to make that judgment call relatively consistently and uncontroversially.<br/><br/>Does that make my interests clearer?  I'm interested in how qualitative judgments are formalized in mechanics and/or used in resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255317/#Comment_255317" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-06T10:49:51+00:00" title="February  6, 2010 10:49AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

I'm trying to expand our definition of Karma to include things beyond simply comparing numbers. Tweet's original discussion of Karma in Everyway could be read as supporting this, I think, but it's not definitive. He basically just says Karma involves consulting a characters' traits, but most of the examples involve comparing numbers. But I think comparing descriptions and fictional positioning are more properly thought of as Karma rather than a weird form of Drama or something else. But, like Eero says, the D/K/F typology is being stretched almost beyond its ability to bear these days. Take resolution in Dogs:<br/><br/>1. You roll dice (Fortune) based on the strength of traits (numerical Karma)<br/>2. You justify bringing in more traits through fictional positioning (descriptive Karma), which gives you more dice (Fortune)<br/>3. You push forward and compare dice values (numerical Karma) that correlate with fictional positioning (descriptive Karma)<br/>4.
