I mean, Peoria has issues, but it's my <i>home</i>. This has been reflected in my roleplaying over the last couple of years. In general, as much as possible, I like roleplaying stories that are set in Peoria. It's fun playing with the local color and referencing places that we know and all that kind of stuff. So, when we played Zombie Cinema last night, "your home town, tonight" wasn't only a natural choice; it was our assumed choice.<br/><br/>So, the zombie apocalypse went down in Peoria last night...and we were all in a bar. Gabrielle played the tough biker who led his gang with an iron fist. Raquel played the tough, competent cop, who was there to arrest me, the would-be Black Panther type, who I asserted was being played by Chris Rock.<br/><br/>I established a lead on the board early on by winning my first couple of conflicts trying to escape from Officer Hancock. Then, Bo and Hancock went head-to-head over his lounging on her police car, bringing the two of them at par on the board...one step below the starting point.<br/><br/>Then the zombies started showing up. One of the first was someone who the gang had actually killed. So Bo, having seen the right movies, coolly dispatches the two zombies, as well as the gang member who had been bitten, and then began barricading the bar. Ned (aka "Wildcat") came running back to the bar, demanding to be let in. Honestly, they probably would have been better off leaving him outside. When the zombies finally broke into the bar, he tried to make his lonesome escape up through a crawlspace, leaving the others to die.<br/><br/>This was an interesting move, actually. In the fiction, my character was backstabbing the group. At the table, I was trying to provide the other characters with a chance to advance towards escape. After all, I liked them better than Ned.<br/><br/>Eventually, Ned broke from the group and stole the police car. But then he was munched by the zombie pawn. So I narrated him trying to ram his way through a crowd of zombies, ramping into the far wall of I-74 in downtown Peoria. And then the zombies converged.<br/><br/>Yeah. Not good.<br/><br/>The other two were in pretty dire straits. They needed to succeed at three conflicts against the zombies in order to make their escape.<br/><br/>They succeeded at the first one, getting out of the bar and heading towards downtown to look for a boat.<br/><br/>They failed at the second one.<br/><br/>I have to run. More later....<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164219/#Comment_164219" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T14:51:13+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  2:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a very minimalistic, hardcore zombie grind. I like those, mainly because I don't get them in my own play - I've mostly played the game with the local teenagers who aren't that much into zombie movies, and while that doesn't detract from the fun of play, it does mean that we never have "just" zombies, it's always communist zombies, space zombies, kungfu-zombies or whatever.

Uh, I'm not totally sure how much of that actually came into play, but we don't generally go very silly, especially in a game about the zombie apocalypse. We <i>like</i> desperate heroism and doomed last stands and all the very human stuff that makes the zombie genre actually work. So I'm not really all that surprised.<br/><br/>All of us have played <i>Zombie Cinema</i> since this game. However, last night, as we sat down to play 3:16, <i>Zombie Cinema</i> came up in conversation. Gabrielle announced that she would love to be able to wipe her memory of this particular run so that we could do it <i>again</i>.<br/><br/>Submitting to a mind-wipe to experience the awesome of a game?

I have a rules question. We had a situation where both characters were one space ahead of the zombie pawn. They rolled a conflict against the zombies and failed. Therefore, they would both need to fall back one space. One player wanted to sacrifice to save the other character. At the time, I ruled that, even after the boost from the sacrifice, the other character pawn would still have to fall back one space.

The zombie pawn in general does not care about the type of conflict, it always moves according to its own rules. That is, it only moves on ties and after a full round has passed since its last move.<br/><br/>As for sacrifice, you can interrupt anything to sacrifice, but your own pawn cannot end up behind the zombie pawn. What this means is that if your character is next to the zombie pawn and the zombie pawn moves, you can't sacrifice anymore - the zombie pawn is coming to your own square. If you wanted to sacrifice before the zombie moved, you'd have to do it before the dice are rolled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165676/#Comment_165676" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T09:48:43+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  9:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (In the situation, the next player held the starting player marker, which is why the zombie was about to move.)<br/><br/>So, in this case, we rolled the dice and both pawns were about to move backwards one space, which would have munched both of them.

That would be like... playing TSoY and encountering an effect that empties your Pool, which you respond to by spending the Pool yourself first, so there is nothing left to take. Perfectly fine if you do the spending before the hostile effect is locked in, though.

Yeah, that would be cool....<br/><br/>Though, honestly, you might do even better by coming up with a few scenarios and then selling them as an expansion pack.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165699/#Comment_165699" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T10:25:52+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 10:25AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about that in a speculative way. It's not my thing, but nothing in the design actually prevents ready-made adventures. I have a few ideas of how to make them flow well in the game's structure, too. Practically I'll just write anything I think up on the website, though, and if the material seems good, I'll collect it into some sort of physical expansion then.<br/><br/>But that's, like, 34th place on my priority list right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
