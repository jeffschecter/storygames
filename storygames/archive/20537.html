It's been a long while since I last posted (busy busy!), but considering all the stuff that's happened, I felt that the community of Story Games deserved my most sincere thanks for being such an awesome place. Thanks to you folks, I was able to make massive amounts of headway in designing Uncharted Worlds <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18726/uncharted-worlds-a-space-opera-game-of-exploration-and-debt" rel="nofollow">during the early days of design</a>. The feedback and discussions helped immensely, allowing me to fine-tune my game.<br/><br/>As of this week, 300+ Kickstarter copies of the book have made their way all over the world, and several hundred more pdfs and print-on-demand books have been sold through <b><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/162122/Uncharted-Worlds" rel="nofollow">DriveThruRPG</a></b>. I owe Story Games a huge amount of gratitude for helping to get me over that initial design mountain (and right into the terrifying swamp of publishing, but that's another story).<br/><br/>So. Yeah. You guys rock. Once I'm done with the stretch goals and such, I have a couple of new projects in mind, so it's likely I'l be slinking back in the future.<br/><br/>-SG<br/><br/>(Edit: I suppose this is a Directed Promotion? I guess?
