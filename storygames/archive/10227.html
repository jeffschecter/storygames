And what levels might we explore between them?<br/><br/>What can we do as designers and players to take advantage of this distinction? Can we help ensure that our games and our characters have the right amount of person-hood? Can we learn solve the problems that seem to plague secondary character mechanics or how to make more abstract persona (like nations or conspiracies) feel like persons during play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227236/#Comment_227236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T12:38:36+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:38PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a litmus-question.<br/><br/>Where would you put characters in books, where the author has full control of them, but you might want to argue for their personhood?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227240/#Comment_227240" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T12:41:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 12:44PM by Wolfe.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, step one is that the player has to want to care about the 'entity' as more than a pawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nDesigners can't do anything about that, so I suppose that you have to simply assume that the player wants to care.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep two would involve making the entity unique. To borrow from Joe's example of Smithers from Simpsons Clue and mine of the dog in Monopoly, there needs to be something distinct, personal in the entity. A short round spire with a nob at the top that is the same for all entities with the exception of color is insufficient. Smithers the character has a personality. The dog has more personality than a archetypical chess pawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving that from boardgame analogies to roleplaying games, the entities need to have more than a token description and a stat block. Also, the fictional elements of the entity ought to be reflected by the stat block.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep three.. Well, I don't know. If the entities are unique mechanically and fictionally, and the players want to care, maybe that's enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamn all this cross-posting today.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuy,<br/>\n<br/>\nMany successful authors would argue for the personhood of their own characters. Given a little time, the characters will figuratively slap the writer's pen away, and start doing their own thing. The author at that point may have narrative control, but the character reacts within the realm of their imagination based on who the character is... Yes, the author *can* write them however they wish... But too often, this is basically fatal to the character, and the character becomes just another pawn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227246/#Comment_227246" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T12:53:19+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:53PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 12:54PM by Thunder_God.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lance, my question was not one where I argue one side or the other, but one where I am curious where Mendel would put it in his model.<br><br>Edit: Regarding most stories, I thought of this as I thought of "emotional manipulation" in books/anime, I realized that the critical stage is always, "The audience <i>decides</i> to care."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227271/#Comment_227271" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T13:21:12+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  1:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy, what I'd point to is that not all characters in all books are perceived as having person-hood and not all characters in all books are perceived as not having person-hood. So there is something similar going on there. And perhaps something to further draw upon? <br><br>Of note, I'm not at all convinced that you need to control a character to attribute it person-hood. <br><br><br>Lance, if it makes it easier, think in terms of making things (either as players or as designers) in games which have the potential to be attributed person-hood. Avoid the silly thought experiments about RPG sociopaths who perceive everything as simply entities to be manipulated, and perhaps instead think about how we increase that potential. <br><br>Uniqueness seems a start, but is that really necessary or really telling? After all, after a short while the events of play will tend to distinguish nearly anything. Although perhaps the truly indistinguishable is of little hope. <br><br>In any case, the fact that it is the only red poker chip in the game may be unique, but does that, combined with anything less than pathological willingness turn the chip into a person?<br><br><br><br/>I suspect there is some resemblance required at the core. Literally a cognitive tripping of our self-models that causes us to treat something which we might know on some level isn't like a person, as a person. It's analogous to what gets activated when we look at a tree and sense an emotion, as though we've assembled a sort of facial expression. <br/><br/>But resemblance can't be enough, because we spend our time interacting with people all the time all too often cannot afford to really, fully perceive them as persons. Its simply too much mental and emotional effort. Indeed, you've probably felt change happen at some point when you've deepened your appreciation for someones' person-hood. Not that you didn't, intellectually know it before, just that you didn't fully let yourself perceive it. Somehow that change happens for some things during RPGs, and not for others. <br/><br/>The question is how can we better handle how that change happens?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227281/#Comment_227281" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T13:41:31+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  1:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I pointed out, the uniqueness needs to be substantial.

That phrase is "She has her own face". This in turn brings back snippets of Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, which uses a remarkably similar phrase more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn both, there is a character alien to our world. To this character, all the people seem homogeneous, a faceless crowd.. Except here and there, there's a character who, even when a minor player in the tale, stands out. This character isn't nameless goon <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, or "Uh.. Karen, her name is Karen, yeah." In the books, the character is shown to be someone that the author cares about, even if you see them for a few pages and never again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe there's a similar aesthetic value in anime. I'm not a really big fan of anime, but it was once explained to me that anime characters are always given distinctive appearances, elements of which may or may not be explained in the fiction. They're also frequently given certain personality traits, which may or may not be exaggerated. Examples include Dragon Ball Z, where you've got Krilin with the dots on his forehead, and Yamcha with the scar on his cheek. Another character appears to be wearing clown makeup, and Bulma's hair is blue. Another anime series which I'm somewhat familiar with is Wolf's Rain. Kiba has these vibrant blue eyes, Tsume has an x-shaped scar on his chest in both human and wolf guise, and his eyes are golden even as a human. Toboe wears the bracelets in both guises, and Hige wears a collar. Personality-wise they're distinctive, and while there's depth to their characters, they fall into readily identifiable roles that make them stand apart from the other characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that better explain what I mean by unique?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227435/#Comment_227435" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T00:38:04+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 12:38AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 12:39AM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're facing off against five orcs.

I was reading something else entirely as uniqueness.<br/><br/>Simon, it seems like what you're describing is that the game element should have (or be perceived to have) the potential for person-like autonomy? Although you seem to be coming at this in terms of innate qualities and to abuse Luke's definition an effects based description perhaps ascribes the elements as faced with meaningful decisions. <br/><br/><br/>In general it might be best to avoid binary examples in favor of increasing the potential that a particular game element is perceived as person-like. <br/><br/>Also, I'm especially intrigued by game elements that aren't strictly person-like in terms of the fiction. Say you are running a fantasy game or designing one, and you want to fulfill a goal of making the Magic seem like a presence to the players - like an actual person in the fiction of the game?<br/><br/>Does the existence of meaningful decisions or emotions of the Magic suffice? Or do we need to literally embody the magic, to make the metaphor into a reality for the effect to be achieved?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
