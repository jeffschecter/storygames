I know that it's an OGL game based on d20. I <i>recall</i> that it was at one time billed as a d20 Modern supplement, though various sources have hinted that it's now a fully self-contained game (the ad copy at Lulu also hints of this, though I've been misled by 'clevr' ad copy before). And then there was all of that spiteful trouble with the Burroughs Estate that held up production for a while. <br/><br/>The buzz died down and the product seems to have largely disappeared from the public eye in the process, though I didn't forget. <br/><br/>I love the old John Carter fiction, dug Space 1889, and can't get enough of novels like Galactic Effectuator and Planet of Adventure. So, for those of you who already have a copy of MARS in your hands, could you please spill the beans? What exactly does the game contain? Is it a supplement as originally planned, or a full-blown game? What sources does it specifically draw on and how well does it represent them? How's the editing? What's the presentation like? Etc, etc, etc?<br/><br/>I ordered a hardbound copy via Lulu, so I have to wait a week or three to actually get my hands on the physical thing. Please, by all means, tell me what I've just purchased and let me know how it worked for you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92414/#Comment_92414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T04:56:54+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  4:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm mildly interested, but I'd like to hear more.

Is it a supplement as originally planned, or a full-blown game?</blockquote>\nFull game -- based on the core d20 Modern rules, with alterations (notably, the combat system by Ian Sturrock, which is based on the combat system he originally designed for Mongoose's CONAN RPG -- truer to the style found in the pulp fantasy fiction of the time). \n<blockquote>What sources does it specifically draw on and how well does it represent them? </blockquote>\nIt is an original setting, based firmly in the Planetary Romance genre.   Authors in that genre include Burroughs, Otis Adelbert Kline, etc.  (and later pastiche authors like Moorcock, Carter, etc.)    The setting was created by Lizard, who was the author of IRON LORDS OF JUPITER (which appeared in Polyhedron a while back).   In my opinion, it is the best representation of the genre yet seen in RPGs (although, again, I am biased).\n<blockquote>How's the editing? </blockquote>\nNot as good as I'd hoped.  (My fault, too.)    Not a lot of typos, etc.   But some of the core d20 Modern rules were omitted accidentally (the rules governing how to use Reputation, and, embarrassingly, Action Points) -- but, as those are available free online, it's not a critical failure.   Just a stupid one.\n<blockquote>What's the presentation like? </blockquote>\nNot sure what you're asking.  If you want to know what the layout, etc. looks like, take a look at the Flash-based preview of <a href="http://adamant.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=50018" rel="nofollow">SLAVERS OF MARS</a>, our first adventure.   The layout is essentially the same, and the cover of SLAVERS is indicative of the interior art of the core book (albeit the core book interior art is black &amp; white).<br/><br/>So, to sum up:   It's pretty solidly d20 -- not a lot of story-game elements to it, but a detailed setting that is easily adaptable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92484/#Comment_92484" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T14:28:40+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  2:28PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2007 2:29PM by jdrakeh.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>Full game -- based on the core d20 Modern rules, with alterations (notably, the combat system by Ian Sturrock, which is based on the combat system he originally designed for Mongoose's CONAN RPG -- truer to the style found in the pulp fantasy fiction of the time).</blockquote>\nExcellent!\n<blockquote>Not as good as I'd hoped.

I've owned it for a little bit and decided that I wanted to run a bout of it at GenCon... and did so. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, I have to say that while a casual read did not reveal the alluded to editing problems (other than the action point thing), actual play revealed a few while referencing the book. (I don't recall specifics right off; if interested, I might be able to browse the book and recall.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanic that I was most interested in seeing in play was the stunt point mechanic. For those not familiar, what the stunt point mechanics does is:<br/>\n<br/>\n- When you roll a natural 20 on any roll, you can choose to "bank" it as a stunt point. You roll again on the roll you were just trying, but it succeeds anyways unless you roll a "1".<br/>\n- You can then spend that point in one of several ways:<br/>\n-- As a natural 20 on any roll, with the caveats that can be boiled down to "you can't be boring with it". In other words, no basic attacks on special characters, only special moves like disarming, sundering, etc.<br/>\n-- To instantly kill a mook in a dramatic fashion<br/>\n-- To emulate a feat<br/>\n-- To request a convenient coincidence.<br/>\n-- Trade in for 2 action points<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stunt points worked well in actual play, especially the "banked 20" and "coincidence" bits. If there is one thing that didn't work well, waiting for a 20 to get them worked out a bit haphazardly, and I'm of the mind to make more reliable and frequent methods to get them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother departure from the D20 Modern rules is that PC/Special NPC types aren't subject to massive damage, but mooks are. However, unlike the actual modern setting, fewer weapons available on Mars have the damage potential to generate damage to trigger that. I may be spoiled by Spycraft 2.0 (where pretty much any hit has the potential to take out a nameless NPC), but I think that it would help the flow of the game to half (or somesuch) the massive damage threshold of mooks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
