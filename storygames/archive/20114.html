The game has been out in Sweden for almost a year now and the reception has been great, both nationally and around the world. Now we hope to get YOUR help in bringing <i>Symbaroum</i> into the international scene. Please visit the Indiegogo campaign page, and if what you see is to your liking, any contribution is greatly appreciated. Likewise, we would be more than happy if you could help us share this fundraiser to your roleplaying buddies around the world! Thank you all!<br/><br/>Visit the fundraiser at<br/><b><a href="http://igg.me/at/symbaroum" rel="nofollow">http://igg.me/at/symbaroum</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
