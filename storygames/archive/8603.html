I'm hoping to play again with some new players and a larger group either this weekend or next (unless we decide to play In a Wicked Age) and I wanted to check on some things with John or other experts before then.  I feel like I once knew the answer to most of these things, but I've apparently forgotten.  Maybe I should write them down.<br/><br/>first, the (hopefully) simple questions:<br/>-I'm a little unclear on exactly how much a player can tweak stats during character creation.  The rules about lowering one ability to raise another could be read in a number of ways.  Can a player only do this once?  Can he do it once for each ability category?  Or can he do it multiple times even within the same category?<br/>-Can impairment drop an ability down to d0?<br/>-What happens if a hero is defeated in battle and doesn't get healed right away?  Obviously he's taking -4 to all rolls, but what if he enters battle again before healing?  Is he not allowed to do so (because he's already at the "defeated" point) or does he get knocked out after one more hit?<br/>-In terms of awarding glory, are all rolls within one battle considered a part of that battle?  For example, if a hero gives up his attack to make a contest for an advantage die, does he get glory for that "sub-contest"?<br/><br/>Somewhat stickier issues:<br/>-I've been looking over semi-recent stuff here on this forum and I was wondering, John, if you've given any thought to how to deal with the potentially problematic "defending with a sword" issue?  If not, I'm thinking if any of my friends decide to make a dual sword wielding dude, I might go with the idea of making the left handed sword -2 to attack and defense... though that sounds potentially too-harsh... hmmm...<br/>-Finally, an issue I remember coming up with my first game. Specifically, in the first game I ran, I believe I had some archer enemies whose bow attacks were armor piercing.  My players wanted to take their weapons after they killed them so that they could have armor piercing attacks.  There are any number of ways I could have rationalized not letting them do that, but in the end I decided to give them a small number of armor piercing arrows.  I can see this potentially arising with other kinds of things too, especially if a quest involves any sort of "magic" weapon.  So I wondered what your thought was about "special items" for the heroes. and, in general, I've been wondering if the rules text of Agon should be read with the idea that "Anything not Forbidden is Permitted" or "Anything not Permitted is Forbidden"?<br/><br/>one one more weird question.<br/>I'd been planning on using Fred Hicks's Heroic Trait Construction Kit optional rules suggestion because I like the idea of giving people more options there, but then I saw someone mention, in a thread here, that there's no point to ever taking a bonus to positioning under a particular circumstance when you could just get +2 to Athletics.  that made me wonder:<br/>in the book, only one Trait combines those two things.  Fleet-Footed, which gives +2 Athletics and +2 to positioning outside.  Are those meant to stack to give a +4 to positioning when outside and a +2 to positioning anywhere else as well?<br/>if not, and I use the Construction Kit, I might just say that the +2 to Athletics doesn't work for positioning.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190662/#Comment_190662" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T10:24:13+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 10:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Tweak stats as much as you want.

I think I'm going to make left handed swords -2 to defend.<br/><br/>The reason I wondered about "special" weapons is because it's possible, IIRC, for the Antagonist to spend strife to change the stats on a weapon.  So maybe the heroes kill a guy that has a sword that is 2d8 instead of 2d6, then they want to use that sword.<br/>which was why I'm wondering if John intended the game text to be a "All things not permitted are forbidden" situation.  Because I can totally see saying, "Well the sword used those dice for him because it's HIS sword and made for him" or whatever, and just letting them take an advantage die... but... well... it's just hard to know sometimes the best way to deal with that kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190672/#Comment_190672" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T11:52:44+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 11:52AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2009 11:54AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, you can also spend strife to increase the damage of, like, a bullman's horns, but you don't see PCs chopping them off and using them as weapons, y'know? The extra damage isn't from the weapon being better; it's from the enemy being stronger/deadlier.  Sure, they can definitely gain an Advantage, like Ben says, but they have to roll for it.  They don't simply get it from looting the bodies.  Remember, you're ultimately pushing for them to spend Fate, right? So everything that makes the PCs better needs to have a cost.

Strong Agon play is built on a foundation of Step On Up.  Trash talking should be encouraged.  Make players roll Orate if they can't decide what to do next, with the winner deciding.  Have villains (or even other good guys they meet) question their bravery and capability. All that good stuff. Your goal as a GM is to make sure the players have a chip on their shoulder and something to prove. That way, they're liable to act impetuously, make mistakes, and have to burn Fate to save their asses. Don't worry about making enemies too tough, because they can always burn Fate to win or at least not die (usually). Press them hard and ridicule them when they complain, as long as you can be a friendly asshole and not just a prick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190683/#Comment_190683" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T13:31:34+00:00" title="January 30, 2009  1:31PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that using two swords is already balanced in the system. You only get one die for your Sword skill, 4d6 for each sword and your name die. That's 6 dice, most of which are d6, but all of which are applicable to attack or defense. Keep in mind you have to say which dice go where at the beginning of each round.<br/><br/>If you have a sword and a shield you get the d8 for the Shield, the die for your Shield skill, the die for your Sword skill, the two dice for the sword, and your name die.

So if you've got a Sword and Shield you can either use your Sword Ability Die <b>or</b> your Shield Ability Die, but not both.  And 2d6 is arguably as good or better than 1d8 (lower max roll, but greater consistency).  It seems odd that it should be as good or better to defend with a sword as it is to defend with a shield.  Plus, if it is, why put bother with the Shield Ability at all?<br/><br/>The thread started as a thread about another use for the Shield Ability from John (though, if I read him right, part-way through the thread, after input from others, he decided it was a bad idea after all) but <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24934.msg250846#msg250846" rel="nofollow">on this post Ben talks about why he dislikes defending with left hand weapons.</a> and afterwords, John agrees.  It's probably not game breaking, though.  The last time I played, my two friends both just used a shield and a spear pretty much constantly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
