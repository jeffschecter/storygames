Each person would get one scene in which they show what is happening with them at that moment.  Once established, other characters could be involved and established characters could be fleshed out in their own scenes by a later player.  Consider something like 9-11, Pearl Harbor, or today's tsunami in Japan played out over the course of 10-20 scenes, each focusing on a different character, taking place in different locations.  Each person gets to advance the umbrella plot a little and detail how it effects a few specific people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
