These days, between easy video, podcasts, online "how to" interactive tutorials, and the like there are a lot of other -- potentially better -- ways to teach folks how to play your game. <br/><br/>We all know some of this. Its much easier to get folks directly into a game by playing with them, say at a con, than by having them read the book alone and separated from any community then figuring out how to not only learn it but teach it to their whole group. We also know that support forums, communities, online FAQs, and the like help people get their heads around games. Even very well written, well designed games do better with community support, con play, and a growing paradigm awareness of how games are played. <br/><br/>A lot of folks around here have done some good pioneering work in supporting games with video, audio, and other methods of online support -- text and non text. I think this is cool, because the more ways we have to support learning and make it more accessible to more folks, the better off the community will be (and the better sales will be). <br/><br/>But why stop there? Its mostly a historical accident that games have been primarily distributed through texts. (If they actually have. I'd love to see a study on how many people actually learn games from reading texts vs playing them with others.) Why not start taking advantage of the growing fields of non-text remote-interaction options to make the primary mode of distributing/learning/teaching games something other than a book? <br/><br/>What about a model where a person who buys a game gets access to tutorials with audio and video examples and its obvious that is the primary mode of learning the game? There could be (maybe should be) a text in addition, especially if its primarily optimized to be useful as a reference at the table during play (as opposed to the way most texts are done today, with an uncomfortable and limiting split between being teaching texts and reference texts). <br/><br/>Or for those who really like the personal connections that come with Indie publishing, what about online play and chat sessions where the designer speaks directly with folks learning the game? <br/><br/>I know I'm not the first one to suggest this, but now its important because I'm thinking about it, and I'm me. How much of our attachment to texts as a primary method of learning and distribution is limiting us? What kinds of business and distribution models can we use if we want to replace the text as primary? <br/><br/><br/><br/>*I say this as someone who works professionally making texts about social interaction and procedural activities, so I'm not just hating here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239335/#Comment_239335" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-27T17:35:15+00:00" title="October 27, 2009  5:35PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand stop reading my mind with your Canadian mind-reading powers.

It explains games in a fair amount of detail.  Gin Rummy, for instance, takes up three of those big pages and three diagrams and an example of play.  Backgammon takes nine and a half pages and 21 diagrams.  Books on Go or Chess for beginners can take several chapters to lay out the rules, and the rest of the book on the techniques of actual play.  Except for extremely simple games, instructional texts tend to be much, much longer than references.  Consider how much of <i>Mouseguard</i> is instructional vs purely reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239362/#Comment_239362" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-27T21:57:59+00:00" title="October 27, 2009  9:57PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I find that a lot of games could be helped by separating the "how to play" and the "what to do while playing"- by which I mean teaching me to play and serving as a reference are two separate goals that can sometimes conflict.

If Dogs In The Vineyard had been released as a series of videos, I would never have learned how to play. Seriously, there's no way I'm going to sit at a computer for an hour, watching videos to learn a game. I'd be flicking around other Internet sites within three minutes. Give me a text I can read on the train instead. I'll read a bit, digest it, read a bit more. It's significantly harder to do that with a YouTube video. In particular, I would probably never <i>playtest</i> a game if I had to learn it through videos: it is much easier to flick through a game in text.<br/><br/>Also, what do I do during the game when I need to check a rule? That's when I check the text, as reference: but that's a different format from the one I've learned the game in. I wouldn't find things as easily. Also, of course, you are introducing two versions of the rules, text and video, and that's fraught with problems: it's inevitable that rules would be differently worded in the two versions.<br/><br/>That said, I like what Peter's saying: I also have the Encyclopedia of Games and I love the use of pictures. I can imagine watching videos as a sort of "GM advice section", where I see Emily leading me through a Sign In Stranger scene. So there's definitely uses, as well as pitfalls.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239402/#Comment_239402" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T08:14:53+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:14AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason and Graham will be left behind with their buggy whips when the revolution comes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239407/#Comment_239407" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T08:26:45+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:26AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't playing a tabletop roleplaying game face to face the definition of clinging to your buggy whip anyway?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239408/#Comment_239408" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T08:26:50+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  8:26AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2009 8:33AM by Graham.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My response to Jonathan's post can be conveniently downloaded as an MP3 from iTunes.<br/><br/>I'd love to see some attempts to use video and audio to communicate play.

A couple times I've jumped into a game and played it once or a few times without really knowing anything beforehand.  This gives a good overview of what the game is and how it runs.  Then if I get the chance I go back and read the text of the rules, but it's already in the context of how it all works together.  But it's hard to beat text for dealing with nitty gritty details (unless you can Q&amp;A an authoritative and/or knowledgeable source).<br/><br/>Video can work well for showing how things work, but if you learn from video there may be some limitation in how much you can apply it to other situations (I'm thinking more demonstration videos than lecture-y).  Simpler systems may be more easily fully teachable by video.<br/><br/>I agree an issue with text as only reference would be a lack of familiarity with the reference because you haven't read it.<br/><br/>Show-y videos could make a good middle ground.  Videos that show how the game runs, demonstrates techniques or procedures, but doesn't necessarily explain them.  More of a supplement and not strictly necessary to learn the game.  Everything is still in the text, and the text is expected to be read, but the video can help to clarify or give an idea of the flow and use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239757/#Comment_239757" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-30T08:55:21+00:00" title="October 30, 2009  8:55AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2009 8:56AM by Wordman.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One game that explicitly prohibits text is the card game <a>Mao</a>, which bans explaining the rules, in any media.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239897/#Comment_239897" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-31T09:24:36+00:00" title="October 31, 2009  9:24AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One interesting thing about this approach:<br/><br/>There is some possibility that instructional videos-as-rule-text-substitute may reach audiences that find RPGs as texts totally opaque.

When I did buy stuff, it would be player use stuff or just kitschy fan stuff if I really loved the game and it was available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240007/#Comment_240007" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-01T13:06:19+00:00" title="November  1, 2009  1:06PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>Isn't this weirdly sorta how many people have experienced RPGs over the years anyway, except instead of videos online, they'd get it by oral tradition?</blockquote>\nYup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
