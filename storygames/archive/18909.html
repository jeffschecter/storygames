In some fashion, you're asking, "X is put in Y situation, what do you do?" Then it becomes, "Well, if X does Y, then Z. So, X would do A." Basically, you're playing diceless RP with yourself. That was my issue, so I had to stop myself from reaching the "then" part. "X does Y," roll dice to determine result to modify "then Z." I pick a scene, any scene, and take an action.

So I borrowed the resolution mechanic from FU and changed it to three possible results: "No, and," "Yes, but," and "Yes, and." If I failed, it was always a "No, and," result. This created more to work with than simply, "Huh, I guess I didn't do anything this turn." If you can introduce granularity for high rolls to your resolution mechanic, or if your system rewards crits, then turn them into "Yes, and," results.

I think knowing what the adventure is about is not at all a bad thing. After all, solo is your chance to do things you want to do, explore themes you want to explore, without compromise amongst others who might otherwise be sitting at your table. If things go 65% the way you thought, no problem. It's the 35% of the twists and turns generated along the way by your system of choice and GM tools that make it interesting and somewhat unstable.<br/><br/>As for "what do you do", it can become more of a story telling exercise than an interactive experience with other players. I find that at least some form journal notation is required \u2014 the degree of that note-taking will depend on you. Is it hard to imagine the action in your head without social stimulation and verbal interaction? Then maybe you need to write down more. How does a dialogue between PC and NPC go? Perhaps you roll a PC's skill check to see if he could tell if the NPC was lying...if he fails, then he takes the NPC's revealed motivation (randomly determined) at face value. If so, the PC knows that person is not telling the whole truth and it's up to him to determine why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423004/#Comment_423004" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-16T12:44:07+00:00" title="October 16, 2013 12:44PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ive played a lot of TRaveller, and subsequently, Traveller World solo, particularly on long flights.

Sometimes I'll try doing something extreme, know I can miss a roll which gives the other side a free move on me. When two sides are contesting over the outcome of a single event I decide which side has the advantage and give that side a plus dice modifier. I roll and the high roller wins. <br/><br/>So this pits full descriptions of a scene to full descriptions of a scene.<br/><br/>It does require the player to step from one role to another, but I don't think that is to hard to do in a fantasy or super hero setting. I can easily see doing something like this in a "Smallville" game. Clark Kent's view versus Lex Luther's who wins each move of the story. <br/><br/>More often for me though is to do some kind of war game scenario for which I'm using a new card system. But the old method works just as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423045/#Comment_423045" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T07:11:39+00:00" title="October 17, 2013  7:11AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a><br/><br/>You can also check out some of the actual play reports <a href="http://www.rpgsolo.com/forum/Forum-Actual-Play-Reports" rel="nofollow">at rpgsolo</a> and <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/tags.php?tag=mythic+gm+emulator" rel="nofollow">at rpgnet here</a> and <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/tags.php?tag=solo+game" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rotting_Zombie" title="Rotting_Zombie"><img alt="Rotting_Zombie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rotting_Zombie">Rotting_Zombie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423084/#Comment_423084" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T19:34:55+00:00" title="October 17, 2013  7:34PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have picked up the Dread PDF and I think I may be able to do this system solo with a little tweaking.
