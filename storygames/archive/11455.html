The "Aha!" only happens if it is somewhat earned, occurring in the fiction as a result of some character action.  Sometimes, the players will quickly do something the GM deems sufficient -- either looking where the GM expected, or looking somewhere totally unexpected that the GM then judges would work.  (In this latter, the GM kinda gets to share the "Aha!" himself!)  Other times, the players will just try stuff that wouldn't work, and frustration will set in.  Still other times, the players will find what the GM expected, but will <i>continue</i> searching, not knowing what else they might find, not knowing whether the scene contain one "Aha!", or several, or none.  This tends to drag.<br/><br/>The last time I played Trail of Cthulhu, I approached it with that "Aha!"-seeking mindset.  I searched carefully and came up with a few neat ideas.  I didn't make any rolls or employ any skills, I just navigated through the gameworld as cleverly as I could.  No luck.  Finally, the GM prompted the group, "Use your Investigative Abilities!"  I said, "Sure."  She told me what my Investigative Ability uncovered.  She told me that I could spend some points for even more info.  I was profoundly unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Now, however, I might approach this differently.  Knowing that each scene contains The One Clue, and knowing that I can make a simple declaration to receive it, I might view navigating the scene as pure color.  It's my chance to portray my character, and to help the GM portray her scene by shining the spotlight of my attention around in it.  And then, when I've had enough of that, I can effectively yell, "Cut!"  I can look at the group, say, "Ready?", get some nods of assent, and tell the GM, "We're ready to get some new info, parse it, and move onto the next scene."  Except, instead of using those words, I say, "I'm using my Investigative Ability."<br/><br/>There's no "Aha!" moment.  The resulting experience is more like <i>reading</i> an investigation than <i>doing</i> one.  But maybe that's the point -- the investigation is just the plot skeleton upon which the <i>real</i> tale of the characters' descent into madness can be strung.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to see how this maps to others' play experiences, and to the designers' intent.  I readily admit that I could be completely off base with respect to Trail of Cthulhu, but even if I am, I think this is an interesting option for RPG investigation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255237/#Comment_255237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T13:04:00+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  1:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently reading through Trail of Cthulhu and hope to run it sometime soon, and this is precisely the concern I have as well.<br/><br/>I get that the Gumshoe thing means you always get the clue. I get that most scenes require you get a clue to move on. So in that situation, it seems like the relevant decision gate the player(s) pass through is, do I spend an Investigation point or two here? It seems like it'd be a tough decision to make, since by definition -- as I understand it -- the player cannot make an educated decision. It seems doubly tough since there's no economy for regenerating Investigation points (although I'll bet you could hack out a pseudo-refresh via ... shoot, what are they called? Designated Pools? The point pools attached to places, things, people, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255239/#Comment_255239" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T13:06:47+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  1:06PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there some reason why you didn't use your skills?

When you want to play your character, you play your character. When you want to investigate, you investigate. It's not, I think, as explicit as you're suggesting (you don't look round and say "Ready?"). It's more a tacit agreement.<br/><br/>As for the rest...I don't know. The basic tenet of Gumshoe is: you get the clues. You never have to worry about getting the clues. Because you don't have to worry about getting the clues, you can do other things: mainly, reacting to the horror. If the Investigators are having trouble getting the clues, you're doing it wrong.<br/><br/>So Investigation Points and clues are meant to <i>get the fuck out of the way</i>, so you can concentrate on the fun stuff. So, Paul, I think you've got the wrong end of the stick. The decision isn't "Do I spend one point or two?". It's "Right, I've got the clue, what do I do with it?".<br/><br/>Perhaps I should run a Skype Gumshoe session. It's easier to show you than explain.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255247/#Comment_255247" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T13:34:23+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  1:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham: That sounds grand.

I have moved to a model that de-emphasizes using the <i>mechanics</i> as the primary interface between Keeper and player; i.e., the "What skill are you using?" approach. Instead, it's a much more traditional "Tell me what you do now . . . " sort of thing. Players describe their actions, and I decide whether a particular description counts as a specific use of their skill, and whether it counts as spend. <br/><br/>Note that this means that my reaction to a player who does something cool, innovative, or unexpected -- i.e., something that's not in my notes -- is the same as it is to a player who's doing exactly what I expect: "You do X? Okay, Y." I recognize that this flies in the face of some people's understanding of how <i>Gumshoe</i> should work. For example, never again will I say, "Spend two Reassurance and I'll give you a bonus clue." And I'll be damned if I ever look at a player and go, "This is a core clue." Rather, you tell me what you do and I'll decide what the relevant game-mechanical effect it. As far as I'm concerned, the Investigative abilities are a pacing and spotlight-rotation mechanism.<br/><br/>In running the game, at any given point in an investigative scene, these are the questions I'm worried about:\n<ol>\n<li>Is there more information (a "clue") available in this interaction?</li>\n<li>Is there an opportunity for role-playing or otherwise allowing players to be cool with their characters if the scene continues?</li>\n<li>Does the currently active player need more spotlight time?</li>\n</ol>\nIf the answer to any of these questions is "no," then I need to think about <i>aggressively scene framing</i> the next thing that needs to happen, even if that's just by shifting the focus to a different player and saying, "Okay, what are you doing now?" It's my job running the adventure to keep players from flailing around aimlessly; if there's nothing else for them to get from a scene, I end it. Conversely, if there's <i>plenty more</i> but they're unable or unwilling to go after it, that's why I've got Drives to hit: "Isn't it true that your Thirst for Knowledge would make you get down on your knees and examine the spores more closely?" Notice that if the answer is no, that's cool too: the scene ends, and whatever information could have been gained there is now either <i>lost</i>, which means that the players will probably be making decisions with incomplete information somewhere down the line, or it <i>floats</i>, which means I have to figure out a way to make it possible for them to get in another way. My preference is for the former, since I try to design TOC adventures so that anything you absolutely need to know hits you in the face.<br/><br/>Either way, I'm stage managing things so that the flow of information and the opportunities for meaningful action and decision-making are apportioned among the players in a satisfying way. The pay-off is a final confrontation for which PCs are either loaded for bear or woefully unprepared, and either of those is fun.<br/><br/>Let me add, finally, that I recognize that TOC is <i>not</i> generally a System Matters kind of game; my sense from reading what Robin Laws has written is that he doesn't really believe that system matters all that much. Ad-hockery is fine, one-off rules are fine. This can be deeply unsatisfying for those of us who enjoy tightly constructed games. For example, I think that ultimately treating Investigative skills and non-Investigative skills differently creates more problems than it solves, but I'm prepared to finesse that issue; there's a simple fix amounting to treating all skills as both particle and wave already implied in the rules. But TOC (and the players it attracts) does let me indulge my passion for quasi-historical narrativist-flavored sim gaming, so I'm prepared to forgive a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255276/#Comment_255276" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T19:08:32+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  7:08PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, <br/>Yeah, I see your point.  I guess the energy I've expended in the past on secrets and plot has been largely about enabling deduction.  So the players can learn A, learn B, and put them together to get C, which is the key to victory or something.  With that deduction pushed aside, I can just think more about making the Lloigor's cave a great scene, which is the kind of stuff I'm used to ad-libbing.<br/><br/>Hmm.  Is there anything in particular you do (beyond what's in the ToC rulebook) in order to prepare scenes to get your players generating strong reactions?  I'm good at ad-libbing color, but less so at hitting PCs where it counts.<br/><br/><br/>Bill,<br/>You're describing the way I've always run this sort of game.

The critical skill is listening to the players: when you say "what are you doing?" you have to be prepared to really hear the answer--and to go get it if necessary. This is a skill, and it needs to be cultivated. Whenever I listen to recordings of games I've run, I often discover moments where a player said something that got lost, and if I'd attended to it in the moment, it would have made the game better--at least for that player. So I'm talking about the kind of active listening that facilitates participation by everyone at the table.<br/><br/>But adventure design matters too. I learned a lot at GenCon running TOC. The feedback I got from the players was that they <i>hated</i> it when it seemed like I was just "reading the story" -- all of the back story and "clues" and so forth. The part they liked was taking action, even though they hadn't uncovered half the clues necessary for them to fully understand what was going on.<br/><br/>So I don't write adventures any more that require deduction in order to be at the right place at the right time or anything like that; if you miss a clue, shit is going to <i>come find you</i>. Instead, I try to write the adventure so that <i>clues enact themselves around the investigators</i>, to be appreciated or not by their active engagement in the scene.<br/><br/>For example, I'm working on an adventure based on the death of occultist rocket scientist Jack Parsons in 1952 California. So the PCs are there at his wake, and all around them the mourners will be acting out their history of antagonisms and attachments that <i>are the clues</i> in the scene. Of course, the PCs appreciation (I mean, of course, <i>perception and understanding</i>) of those clues is contingent upon their engagement with the scene: they get access to the NPCs enactment of the clues via what they do and who they talk to.<br/><br/>Like this:\n<blockquote><cite>from "The Babalon Working," a work in progress</cite><b>Jane Wolfe (b. 1875, age 77)</b><br/>Jane is frail-seeming but fierce, a hawk-like old woman, still striking in appearance and demeanor. She will take the typescript from Candy\u2019s hands and finish reading the poem, but is obviously reciting from memory. Play her extravagantly, a real-life Norma Desmond with a hint of Shirley MacLaine-like proto-New Age wackiness thrown in.<br/><br/><i>And I dreamed<br/>and the great powers<br/>moved over me<br/>And a voice cried<br/><br/>Go free, star, go free<br/>Seek the dark home<br/>On the wild sky<br/>Good bye, star, good bye!</i><br/><br/><b>Art History (1 pt spend).</b>Jane Wolfe was a silent film-era character actress who appeared in many films during the 1910s, including a major supporting role under Mary Pickford in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. In the late 1930s she played the hero\u2019s mother in a Western about Pancho Villa. [Note: This information can be parlayed into the Flattery clue, below, even by an investigator without Flattery.]<br/><br/><b>Flattery.</b>  Oh, yes, she came to Hollywood when it was young, and she could have been a <i>star</i>\u2014but she gave it all up for Aleister, don\u2019t you know, unholy Aleister Crowley, the magician. Three years she was in Sicily, at the Abbey of Thelema with Crowley. She was his Scarlet Woman, his Red Flame, his elemental, his <i>muse</i>.

I also try to listen to players, avoid recitation, and inject excitement into any extended slowness.  You seem to prep a lot more specifics than I do.  <br/><br/>I like the technique of using people as clues, wherein the players can chase them or they can chase the players.

Sometimes I even give players the tools to require me to do it. For example, I was running an adventure set in 1934 California and had told the players that if they spent Cthulhu Mythos points, that essentially <i>made things true</i>. So one player, as Irving Thalberg, spent his Mythos points to establish the existence of an evil Mythos-based conspiracy involving Louis B. Mayer, William Randolph Hearst, and several others -- "a coven of thirteen!" That was not in my notes, as I had envisioned a different arrangement. But now the players were fighting the conspiracy.<br/><br/>As far as returning to the stuff I've prepped, I don't worry too much about that. A theory is a solution; it's a guide to action, and as long as the players have a theory, they know what to do. All I have to do at that point is <i>react</i> to what their theory tells them to do, which will usually be go fight somebody or blow something up.\n<blockquote>Your example investigative abilities provide an interesting contrast.

I wonder if these preferences are something I'll have to ditch to run ToC correctly?</blockquote>\nThis points to an essential conundrum of ToC. How should players signal their use of a skill? To my mind, "I use Flattery" is insufficient; the player should actually role-play the attempt to ingratiate the investigator with the NPC. All Interpersonal skills should work that way. But a player without the skill should not be able to get the information keyed to the skill, otherwise <i>why have the fucking skills?</i> If it's vital information, it's a "core clue" and there should be multiple ways of getting it, or it should be a "floating core clue," delivered to the players with any sufficiently significant effort. Besides, a player attempting to flatter the old woman without the Flattery skill can be an occasion for some amusement, as you get to play out the rejection of the compliment: "Young man, you are <i>tiresome</i> and obsequious. Please! I used to be a <i>star</i>!"<br/><br/>Similarly, what sorts of things require a spend? I made Jane's bio a spend because it's <i>obscure</i> knowledge; I can say to the investigator with the highest Art History, "That fierce-looking old woman looks familiar; do you think you recognize her?" ("Why, yes, yes I do." "Spend 1 Art History." "Ehh...perhaps I was mistaken.") So the receipt of the information is a choice that the player makes <i>in order to tell us something about his or her character</i>.<br/><br/>My basic principle is that <i>it's all role-playing</i>. What I mean is, the delivery of information to the players should be tied to their role-playing in as explicit a fashion as possible. You do X, you see or hear Y. Of course, this brings up the problem of using a skill that you as a player don't actually possess: what do I know about forensic medicine? In that case, though, the relevant action is, "I examine the body."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Related thought: for observation or knowledge abilities, I could whisper the found clues to the player.

If players come up with other ways of finding stuff out - let them, in fact encourage them. You can run a scene exactly as you would in any game where you would ask them to roll dice, except they don't roll dice. It's no more or less a shopping list than any other game which includes some predetermined information.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you spend points, you should get a cool spolight scene or other special benefits, eg gaining a contact, getting a pool in an obscure subject ("local gossip"), solving an ethical dilemma or getting a shortcut around danger ("your car is booby trapped")<br/>\n<br/>\nIf for some reason a player puts a zero in an interpersonal skill, they are indicating that they are very, very bad at doing that. I reccommend that players who want their characters to be able to flatter people to stick one point in that skill. If you want to be good at all interpersonal skills, put points in every one. If you have more than one point in flattery, you are a consumate flatterer - it's a big part of your character, and if an NPC can be flattered, you can do it. So, if someone wants to flatter and NPC and they have zero points in it - that's a character creation issue. If this does come up, I'd simple allow them to juggle some investigative points around or assign their spare point to reflect their view of the character.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor moving on in Trail of Cthulhu, we have a lovely "Scene" card which can be used to indicate it's time to move on on our download page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255427/#Comment_255427" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T18:11:04+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  6:11PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>I differ from Bill a bit on this.<br/><br/>There<i>is</i>a way of improvising Trail of Cthulhu, in which you jump on the ideas you give them.

I should note that in the case that I detailed, I felt obligated to obey the rules as I'd explained them to the players: spend a point or two of Mythos, and your supposition is <i>true</i> as long as it's consistent with what's gone before. In that case I was happy to improvise; the coherence of the mystery was less important than the paranoid atmosphere that was thus created. But it's certainly possible for players to simply be <i>wrong</i> on a given point of deductive logic, in that their conclusions don't follow from the available evidence, or they've missed something that I think is important.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm not afraid of a player saying, "Huh!

Because it doesn't need one.<br/><br/>Why does ToC need one?</blockquote>\nThis is a fun question. To extend Graham's answer a little bit, I'd say there are two functional reasons why ToC uses a clue-finding system.<br/><br/>(a) <b>To differentiate characters one from another.</b> If you only get clue Clue X because you have skill A, and she only gets Clue Y because she has Skill B, then you guys can each say you've contributed meaningfully to solving the mystery.<br/><br/>(b) <b>As a pacing mechanism.</b> If the situation is such that the revelation of Clue Z shines a clarifying light on Clues X and Y, serving to inspire and guide appropriate remedial action, a formal clue-finding system can be useful in specifying that situation. Arguably, DITV's town creation system is <i>its</i> "formal clue-finding system," in the sense that you lay out NPCs and point them at each other in light of the overall progression of sinfulness in the town. <br/><br/>The difference in terms of pacing, of course, is that DITV embeds its clues in its NPCs, in the expectation that information will be revealed in the course of the Dogs' interactions with townspeople; TOC embeds its clues in skill-keyed scenes, in the expectation that information will be revealed in the course of the investigators' progress from one "crime scene" to the next. You will have to be the judge as to which system is more elegant and flexible; I will refrain from invidious comparison. But it should be noted that, structurally, they operate from similar methodological premises: figure out what happened before the PCs come on the scene, and then imagine the traces (e.g., clues, what townsfolk want from the Dogs) that this leaves on the situation at present, when the characters arrive.<br/><br/>Of course, you could say that mechanically, there's a big difference because in DITV you don't have to break your heart fussing around with what skills unlock what clues; you know what the information is and you're dying to give it to the players so that they can confront the moral choice emergent from the situation. Your character sheet and abilities signpost how you'll <i>deal with</i> what you find out, rather than how you find it out. So the larger issue, and the one that speaks more directly to John's question, is whether or not it's worth it to make the big deal about "investigative skills" that ToC makes.<br/><br/>I think the answer ultimately is yes, given the Lovecraftian aphorism about the mind and its fortunate inability to correlate all its contents. To me, the ideal <b>Trail of Cthulhu</b> scenario is a big complex unexplainable mess with ramifying complications and rhizomatic resonances that pop up throughout the adventure: "Why is this here? What does this mean? <i>What the hell is going on?</i>" The PCs' investigative skills orient them to the kinds of information that will come to their awareness as they engage with the scenario. In contrast to <i>Dogs</i>, in TOC what the characters <i>do</i> once they know everything hardly matters; the question is <i>are they even able to proceed</i>, given what they had to go through to find it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255456/#Comment_255456" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T07:04:16+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  7:04AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>To me, the ideal Trail of Cthulhu scenario is a big complex unexplainable mess with ramifying complications and rhizomatic resonances that pop up throughout the adventure: "Why is this here?

It's true that some games don't have a "fruitful void," in the sense of a non-mechanized premise that underlies the game mechanical structure, but if you take "fruitful void" simply to mean "what this game is about," then you can answer that question for just about every game. So if Dogs is about what it means to enact justice, what is ToC about? What it means to confront the ineffable, maybe. It's intended to simulate the existential crisis of the romantic confronting the modern. What do you do when nothing you do matters, in the long run?<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's certainly true that you can look at a game's mechanical structure and critique how well it supports what it is ostensibly about, or even dispense with critique and strive merely to describe what a certain set of mechanics suggest they will support when enacted in play in a particular way. In TOC you've got the skill mechanics, in which some skills are "general" and used in a more-or-less traditional way, and others are "investigative" and used to regulate the flow of information from GM to player. At the same time as this information flow is taking place, PCs are also being exposed to events that may drain them of other resources, such as Health or Stability/Sanity. As you lose those, you become less able to gain access to information and somewhat less effective in general. Additionally, you are encouraged to role-play the effects of Stability loss by stammering, stuttering, going all twitchy, and so forth.<br/><br/>To my mind, giving players permission to role-play losing their shit is one of the great services that ToC and CoC provide. This belief probably colors my analysis of the game. In any event, to the extent that ToC is a coherent design at all, its strength lies in the subordination of deduction and problem-solving to the experience of being overwhelmed by the incomprehensible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255514/#Comment_255514" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T10:15:48+00:00" title="February  8, 2010 10:15AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I need to read the book.

Maybe it's like what Jonathan Walton was talking about in the "qualitative karma" thread: here's a way of qualitatively formalizing the fictional content of a game that enables engaging with that content in play in a more-or-less predictable way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255552/#Comment_255552" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T13:42:07+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  1:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm. Okay. So if the...aboutness of the game is having your character lose his shit in the face of incomprehensible evil, is that actually a satisfying void to fill? <br/><br/>I guess I'm thinking about my own CoC experience, which of course is NOT ToC. Actually I don't know that I've ever played a game where the point is to guide my character to a point where he loses his shit. At least in CoC, I can see why the investigation, the problem solving, becomes the point. Losing SAN was fun but it felt to me like it was a countdown -- when I'm out of SAN, I don't get to investigate, solve, overcome any more. Like investigation hit points I guess.<br/><br/>Actually there is an RPG I can think of where the point is to lose your shit: Kult, a terrific old horror game from Target Games AB. But losing your shit means you actually become <i>more effective</i> per the conceit of the setting. So you're trying to guide your character to a point where something breaks, but doing that means gaining a power-up.<br/><br/>It seems like losing your shit in ToC is sort of...the very point. The aboutness. Which I guess puts it in a similar family of play as Dust Devils or With Great Power -- doing what you're going to do means burning your character to the ground.

The skill list serves as inspiration, and covers the bases for the types of activities that tend to come up in play.  Now the player can make an informed decision about which ones he wants to do.  If he's picking something he knows nothing about ("auto repair"), he's basically <i>taking</i> knowledge for his character that he lacks.  If he's picking something he's good at ("lying"), he's <i>representing</i> that he intends to use his own skill in the game.<br/><br/>The point-buy system ensures that all players wind up with an equal ability to be effective in the fiction via their characters.  So, if I, Dave, am a brilliant diplomat, and my buddy, Ned, is not, this needn't give me more overall power in the fiction.  I spend my point on diplomacy while he spends his on shooting guns.<br/><br/>Perhaps the text could be clearer on "if you want to use a skill in play, buy it, even if it's one you have as a player".<br/><br/>(This is also problematic for handing out pre-gens at cons.)<br/><br/>Doing char-gen for a campaign, I'd want to pass around character sheets and collectively come up with a good group dynamic.  E.g., if we have multiple players with real-life diplomacy skills, one of them might say, "Dave, you can do that.  I'm gonna play an uncouth lout this time."<br/><br/>Then once you're in play, having established that maybe your character can do some things you can't, how best to establish a given success/failure?  Numbers and dice might not be my personal preference, but it seems workable enough.<br/><br/>I'd be really curious to hear whether my thought process here matches the designers'...<br/><br/>As for signalling skill use, here are my preferences:<br/>I think you have to allow stuff that would obviously work to work, and trust that players are playing their characters, and that char-gen churned out fair characters.  Then, for stuff that wouldn't obviously work, when the "so what happens?" moment arrives, you pick up some dice, or tell someone else to pick up their dice.  At that point you discuss and agree on what numbers apply.  <br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255559/#Comment_255559" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T14:16:32+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  2:16PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Losing your shit:</b><br/>ToC is set up so that this happens slowly.

It was a labour of love to the extent that it would have been very difficult for me to absorb it all and run the game. Often my games start from a fact or a picture that I've noticed and researched, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ac%C3%A9phale" rel="nofollow">this one</a> which lead to a scenario set in Paris in 1936.<br/><br/>There is no one fruitful void in Trail of Cthulhu, people play it for all sorts of different reasons. For some, finding out what is going on is the issue. Whilst this may seem to be trivial given that core clues are handed out like toffees, this is not the case. The core clue moves the characters from place to place but don't necessarily explain; indeed, in many games there is no explanation as such because the Mythos works in such ineffable ways, interpretation is often dubious, but some strive for it anyway. For others it's a dichotomy, what Ken Hite calls the Man who shot Joseph Curwen. Mythos is madness and death but the only way to defeat it is to use Mythos powers and in so doing doom yourself. For others, it's trying to behave as a naturalistic character in a mad world.<br/><br/>For me, Mythos roleplaying is very narrative in that it ressembles a story. Internal motivations of the characters are very important and conflicts they have with themselves often a crux of what happens in the game. In a session Graham ran last year, one of the key moments was when Simon's character tried to avoid the horror by getting on a train, but he just took it with him and was forced to return to confront the issues. In a recent game of Robin's my character was obsessed with the King in Yellow, tricking other players so he could keep reading his copy but then refusing to confront the King when he appeared, his patriotic drive was the clincher and he ended up saving the world. In another game of Graham's there was a pathetic fight between two characters both who wanted the same thing to happen, but for different reasons, and couldn't explain it to each other - it was glorious. Something right out of the pages of a cosy catastrophe.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that even whilst people are playing the same game for different interests, it doesn't often seem to be a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255685/#Comment_255685" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T05:18:43+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  5:18AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Maybe I need to read the book.

I mean, are there really people out there whose primary source of fun is the fact they're they're the "fingerprint guy".  They get to have that moment where the clue gets passed TO THEM.  And that's the payoff.  Imagining that they're the fingerprint guy.<br/><br/>On the one had I totally believe that there must be people like this.

But I guess I'm thinking about the genre fiction, and the fun isn't the fact that Fingerprint Guy has found a fingerprint -- rather, the presence of the fingerprint is like a signpost saying "and now it's time for Fingerprint Guy to have some time on-screen." So what does Fingerprint Guy do with that screen time? Surely he doesn't wax rhapsodic about the fingerprint.<br/><br/>I'm going to wander into Virtual Play territory here for a second (as opposed to Actual Play, since I still need to get my group together to actually do this stuff but the exercise is still valuable to me).<br/><br/>Say we're playing a theoretical X-Files RPG powered by Gumshoe. Mulder is Weird Alien Shit Guy (WASG), Scully is Rational Science Girl (RSG). So our characters are in a scene where the clue is...a sliver of metal, covered in runes, that apparently has no mass and is completely undetectable by any equipment. The GM decides WASG has the correct Investigation skill to receive the clue. That's a signpost that it's WASG's turn to do whatever WASG is going to do. That may or may not have anything to do with theorizing on this clue, although I'm betting there'd be some of that at the table. <br/><br/>Later, the scene clue is a ... fingerprint on that crazy sliver of metal. Well, that's RSG's territory! The GM says RSG finds the clue, and that's a signpost for RSG to theorize, or really do whatever RSG wants to do with that moment.<br/><br/>If that's basically correct, I hope a Gumshoe guru -- say, Graham, if he's come down off the ledge :-) -- will tell me, or explain where I got it wrong. Then I'll have a followup if I'm correct: Namely, I think there's some looseness in my head about what a player <i>does</i> with that spotlight time, other than receive the accolades of the table for having the right skill at the right time. Thoughts? Are there particular flags on the character sheet we should be paying attention to?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255773/#Comment_255773" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T11:52:38+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 11:52AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 11:53AM by Jesse.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Namely, I think there's some looseness in my head about what a player<i>does</i>with that spotlight time, other than receive the accolades of the table for having the right skill at the right time.</blockquote>\nMan, I hope so because whenever I read a GUMSHOE game all I can see in my head is a GM with a big stack of index cards.  On the back of each card is written: Core Clue.  Then at some point he says, "John, you have Interdimentional Rift Analysis, right?"  And John says with hesitance laced with anticipation, "Why, yes, yes I do."  And then the GM extends his hand towards John with an index card.  John's face lights up like he's just won the lottery and he looks around the group as if to say, "Guys!  Guys!  It's ME this time!  I've been CHOSEN!"  And then he clears his throat and he delivers a little spiel about his character doing some rift analysis.  It's the little spiel he's been waiting ALL NIGHT to give.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255780/#Comment_255780" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T12:13:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 12:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>(b) his knowledge of the truth didn't give him any corresponding ability to convince anyone else.</blockquote>Wait, so, the other players knew he was right, but still played their characters as skeptical?  They didn't shepherd their characters into somehow following the trail that they as players knew to be true?  Or was this simply not a trail at all, and rather just pure color, of no decision-affecting consequence?  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>If I made it sound like prep is unnecessary, I've misspoken. It's the opposite, in fact. The thing that gives one confidence in one's ability to improvise is one's command of the material in question, thus rendering prep<i>supremely necessary</i>. I take your question as having to do with how, if one is planning on improvising in play, what kinds of prep will be most helpful. I think the answer is knowledge of setting and period detail, NPC motivations and agenda, and lists of names for random selection.</blockquote>Goddamn internet.  I was completely unclear.  Let me try again.<br/><br/>Let's say you've got your Core Clues.  You've got your key Evil NPC behind the Mythos events.  You've got a full knowledge of the setting.<br/><br/>Your players decide that what they need to do to stop the Mythos threat is summon Satan and beat him in a fiddle contest.  This catches you by surprise.  They start looking for ways to summon Satan.  Now, your knowledge of the setting can help you lend color to that experience, and help you decide where they might find such info.  <br/><br/>But how are you going to give them the next Core Clue to the Mythos plot?<br/><br/>Do you use NPCs?  Are the PCs going through Satanists' bookshelves, when your Evil NPC's minions show up and attack them, making sure to leave behind a note that says, "Satan isn't real.  Hastur is.  We're working on summoning Hastur at Central Park."?  How do you make it more elegant than that?<br/><br/>My solution usually boils down to, "Be a good GM."  Can you unpack what you do any better than that?  Because I think there are key skills to facilitating this type of flexible play, and without them, the game risks reaching a "What the fuck do we do now?" state.                        </div>\n<div

In my experience, the guys who want to do character acting get frustrated with the guys who get obsessive about understanding what's going on, as the latter produces some bland investigation moments where there's no situation to roleplay off.  Of course, this isn't anything that can't be solved by good player-to-player communication, so I'm not surprised you and your friends can make it work.  I'd just be worried about the same at a con.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255801/#Comment_255801" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T14:50:56+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  2:50PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 2:55PM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, <br/><br/>Have you ever watched CSI?

It doesn't so much have a Nar based fruitful void (there at least) because it isn't doing that. Its doing the other thing. Which is exactly enjoying the worldness and the rightness of having these set of skills to solve this set of mysteries. So, asking why there is so much attention given to the skills and skill lists and number of investigative skills with such raw perplexity seems rather like one of the "brain damaged" White Wolf players asking with such perplexity why the fuck anyone would want to be able to narrate their own failure. <br/><br/>(*Note: I've only watched about half an episode, as I hate that show like Graham hates himself.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255814/#Comment_255814" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T15:51:37+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  3:51PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 3:55PM by Graham.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand is spot on, I think.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Can you move your Core Clue all the way from the ship to some random guy you threw into an earier scene as pure color</blockquote>\nSure, I would. The point is that the clues come out, so if the Investigators are having fun questioning hobos, why not put the clue over there? If they were associating with high society, I'd put the clue there, too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><br/>Say we're playing a theoretical X-Files RPG powered by Gumshoe. Mulder is Weird Alien Shit Guy (WASG), Scully is Rational Science Girl (RSG). So our characters are in a scene where the clue is...a sliver of metal, covered in runes, that apparently has no mass and is completely undetectable by any equipment. The GM decides WASG has the correct Investigation skill to receive the clue. That's a signpost that it's WASG's turn to do whatever WASG is going to do. That may or may not have anything to do with theorizing on this clue, although I'm betting there'd be some of that at the table.<br/><br/>Later, the scene clue is a ... fingerprint on that crazy sliver of metal. Well, that's RSG's territory! The GM says RSG finds the clue, and that's a signpost for RSG to theorize, or really do whatever RSG wants to do with that moment.</blockquote>\nPaul, I don't think I'd enjoy that game. Here's how I'd run that.<br/><br/>Think of clues as pieces of information, rather than objects. So the Core Clue is <i>the guy who last handled that sliver of metal</i>, who we'll call Canadian Ken. Another clue is <i>the sliver of metal has no mass</i>.<br/><br/>Then, the Keeper says "Right, so there's this sliver of metal and you're in the lab. What do you guys do?". And perhaps RSG uses Physics, so the Keeper says the metal has no mass.<br/><br/>Then we roleplay for a while. It's not a set thing, it just happens. RSG says "That's impossible". WASG says "What?". RSG says "It's got no mass. That's scientifically impossible. It's resting there". Probably, RSG makes a Stability check, and loses her shit a bit.<br/><br/>So then they analyse it a bit more. Perhaps WASG uses Forensics on it and the Keeper says "Yeah, there's a fingerprint". Then they match the fingerprint and it belongs to Canadian Ken. Or perhaps RSG uses Cop Talk to talk to the local police. And they say, yeah, they found the metal at a lock-up, which Canadian Ken uses.<br/><br/>And what's fun is the roleplay. Sure, revealing the mystery is <i>slightly</i> fun, but what's really fun is playing the characters as they encounter the impossible.<br/><br/>Conversations like this are hard, because you guys focus on the mechanics. But much of the fun happens outside the mechanics: in that way, Trail of Cthulhu is an old-school game. It's like the White Wolf games, where all the mechanics are about combat, but nobody ever fights, because they're enjoying roleplaying the characters. The system =/= the mechanics.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255818/#Comment_255818" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T16:12:27+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  4:12PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Think of clues as pieces of information, rather than objects.

HUGE.<br/><br/>No, I'm not joking.<br/><br/>What you're saying here is that a Core Clue is kind of large conceptual thing and the skills can come at that concept from many angles.  Is this actually expressed in the text or your own interpretation?<br/><br/>From MY reading, a GUMSHOE game has a specific "puzzle piece" as a core clue.  Like the Core Clue might be a "torn piece of red cloth"  Any body with Fiber Analysis will find it.  A point will tell you it's Wool.  Two points will tell you specifically that it's from a sweater because of the stitching.  The game is then to remember that earlier the GM described Candadian Ken as wearing a red sweater.<br/><br/>If you don't remember that you're stuck until you do.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255820/#Comment_255820" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T16:27:22+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  4:27PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 4:28PM by Graham.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's certainly my interpretation.

If you've seen The Dying Of St Margaret's, that's how I run Trail of Cthulhu: each clue is a piece of information, which can be revealed in different ways.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255824/#Comment_255824" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T16:30:37+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  4:30PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That changes a lot.<br/><br/>It really does.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255827/#Comment_255827" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T16:33:36+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  4:33PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2010 4:40PM by PaulB.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>That changes a lot.<br/><br/>It really does.<br/><br/>Jesse</blockquote>\n+1<br/><br/>EDIT: Okay! So this whole thread has worked out for me what my core issue is: Trail of Cthulhu doesn't have especially clear/inviting/pactical Investigation guidelines. I mean, your explanation here is terrific and totally transforms my approach to the game. Reading the included Investigation didn't do that for me, and while I'll be happy to drop some bucks on <i>The Dying of St. Margaret's</i> it's unfortunate that it, or something like it, wasn't included in ToC as a "best practices" type of document. :-/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255855/#Comment_255855" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T20:23:01+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  8:23PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2010 4:23AM by Bill_White.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>(b) his knowledge of the truth didn't give him any corresponding ability to convince anyone else.</blockquote>Wait, so, the other players knew he was right, but still played their characters as skeptical?  They didn't shepherd their characters into somehow following the trail that they as players knew to be true?  Or was this simply not a trail at all, and rather just pure color, of no decision-affecting consequence?<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to answer this. It seemed to matter at the time. I think the other player's skepticism was by way of role-playing.<br/><br/><code>INT. -- TROCADERO CLUB<br/><br/>The club is not crowded. Irving Thalberg enters and staggers <br/>his way to a table where 40-year-old girl reporter Adela Rogers <br/>St. Johns is having a drink with Willie Wilkerson, gossip-mongering <br/>club owner. Wilkerson excuses himself, and Thalberg collapses <br/>into a seat. He still wears what looks like a hospital bracelet around<br/>his wrist.<br/><br/>ST. JOHNS: Darling, you look terrible! What happened to you?<br/><br/>THALBERG: My heart . . . I was in the hospital. But I had to get out of there.<br/><br/>ST. JOHNS: I know what you mean! Dreadful places.<br/>.<br/>THALBERG: No, no, they were trying to get me. The Sons of the Bird came out <br/>of the window and told me they were watching me.<br/><br/>ST. JOHNS: I was going to offer you a drink, darling, but I don't think that's such <br/>a splendid idea.<br/><br/>THALBERG: They're all in on it, you see. Hearst, Mayer, Teague . . . all of them.<br/><br/>ST. JOHNS: In on what?<br/><br/>THALBERG: They're a coven! And they're servants of the Black God! I know it's true!<br/><br/>ST. JOHNS: How did you learn this?<br/><br/>THALBERG: From the things that Mad Al Hazard told me!<br/><br/>ST. JOHNS: The vagrant who attacked you?<br/><br/>THALBERG: No, no, he didn't attack me. It was Pearl Hat Tony!<br/><br/>ST. JOHNS: Let's get you out of here, darling.</code><br/><br/>So you tell me . . . is that color or consequence? The player's ability to spend Mythos points to make stuff true didn't mean that anyone in the fiction could be given evidence that it was in fact true. So St. Johns player could just have been role-playing in response to inconsequential persiflage, or could have been positioning the character in response to the fact that they couldn't convince anyone in the game-world of its truth.\n<blockquote><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>If I made it sound like prep is unnecessary, I've misspoken. It's the opposite, in fact. The thing that gives one confidence in one's ability to improvise is one's command of the material in question, thus rendering prep<i>supremely necessary</i>. I take your question as having to do with how, if one is planning on improvising in play, what kinds of prep will be most helpful. I think the answer is knowledge of setting and period detail, NPC motivations and agenda, and lists of names for random selection.</blockquote>Goddamn internet.  I was completely unclear.  Let me try again.<br/><br/>Let's say you've got your Core Clues.  You've got your key Evil NPC behind the Mythos events.  You've got a full knowledge of the setting.<br/><br/>Your players decide that what they need to do to stop the Mythos threat is summon Satan and beat him in a fiddle contest.  This catches you by surprise.  They start looking for ways to summon Satan.  Now, your knowledge of the setting can help you lend color to that experience, and help you decide where they might find such info.</blockquote>\nThere's a lot of play packed into the sentence, "Your players decide that what they need to do to stop the Mythos threat is summon Satan and beat him in a fiddle contest." How they got to where they are will make a difference in terms of how you respond.\n<ol>\n<li>You gave them some narrative mojo and they used it carte blanche.</li>\n<li>They misinterpreted a clue you gave them--they found the score to the Satanic Fugue in C Major and jumped to conclusions; the player with Cryptography was supposed to examine it in order to get a dedicated pool point of Art useful for playing the sequence of tones that will lock Hastur into the form of the King in Yellow, in which state he may be defeated.<br/></li><li>They're just crazy; the Satan thing came out of the blue and has no perceptible connection to anything that's happened in play thus far.<br/></li></ol>\nIn the first instance, you have to roll with it. Satan? Shit, yeah, playing that music at midnight in a graveyard under a new moon brings Old Scratch himself to call, caterwauling on the strings of his ebony violin using his tail as the bow. Now what you gonna do, clever man?<br/><br/>In the second, you're allowed to use their mistake against them. You can say, "Yeah, it doesn't work. It's midnight, you're standing there in the graveyard on the hill overlooking the town with a beat-up old fiddle in your hands and a disappointed look on your face. And, um, now you can faintly hear the sound of screaming rising from the streets below; there seems to be a disturbance near the old Masonic temple. Now what do you do?" But you could also do the same thing as in the first instance.<br/><br/>In the third, you can opt to remind the players of what genre they're playing in, meta-communicatively. Maybe they'll respect that they're spoiling your fun by refusing to stick to the source material. Or you can translate their Christian iconography into Mythos terms. Satan = Hastur, fiddle-playing contest = theremin-enabled confrontation with madness-inducing truth.\n<blockquote>But how are you going to give them the next Core Clue to the Mythos plot? Do you use NPCs?  Are the PCs going through Satanists' bookshelves, when your Evil NPC's minions show up and attack them, making sure to leave behind a note that says, "Satan isn't real.  Hastur is.  We're working on summoning Hastur at Central Park."?  How do you make it more elegant than that?</blockquote>\nSee, if you subscribe to the theory that all human myth is merely half-understood allegory of Mythos truth, then those satanic volumes contain allusions to the secrets necessary to learn the answers they're seeking. Once again, Satan = Hastur. Everything else follows from that.\n<blockquote>My solution usually boils down to, "Be a good GM."  Can you unpack what you do any better than that?  Because I think there are key skills to facilitating this type of flexible play, and without them, the game risks reaching a "What the fuck do we do now?" state.</blockquote>\nI agree. My philosophy is listen to the players and let their characters act, even if what they are doing is <i>totally wrong</i>. A tragedy is a story, too.

So the Core Clue is<i>the guy who last handled that sliver of metal</i>, who we'll call Canadian Ken.</blockquote>From MY reading, a GUMSHOE game has a specific "puzzle piece" as a core clue. Like the Core Clue might be a "torn piece of red cloth" Any body with Fiber Analysis will find it. A point will tell you it's Wool. Two points will tell you specifically that it's from a sweater because of the stitching. The game is then to remember that earlier the GM described Candadian Ken as wearing a red sweater.<br/><br/>If you don't remember that you're stuck until you do.<br/><br/>In GUMSHOE <i>you don't get stuck</i>. It's like CSI. Whenever they investigate a scene, there's always something to take them to the next scene. Fibre Analysis would tell you, as a core clue, that you're looking for someone with a red sweater. And that won't cost any points. Points aren't, at least in my games, a way of micromanaging information. They are a way of giving spot-light time, bringing new things to bear on problems and getting supplementary information. Also, you can't always spend a point and get something. The piece of cloth might just be that. <br/><br/>The guy with Fibre Analysis might say, I'll spend some time in the lab analysing it and I might say, "It's just a piece of cloth from a red sweater" (no point cost) or I might say "You find some strange residue which you could put in the mass spectrometer but it would take some time and effort" (indicating it will cost at least a point).<br/><br/>If the player goes with it (which they mostly do), I might say "The residue turns out to be a complicated organic compound. It's been subjected to some very intense processes because under the microscope it was difficult to discern any recognisable structure but you're pretty sure that it's actually some kind of grey matter, you know, from a brain." <br/><br/>This information doesn't actually point to anything in particular but it does give a different flavour to what is going on and might be useful at some point, perhaps the PCs have to choose between exploring a warehouse or an abatoire and the supplementary clue indicates that the latter is more likely.<br/><br/>The other way of spending points is for benefits. These are great when the players get the hang of them and are basically permission to make stuff up, create new connections etc. So you might spend a point of Library Use to:<br/>- find a book quickly<br/>- get permission to take a book out of a library<br/>- find a particular book that gives you a pool of points for something else, e.g. bombs for dummies might give you a one off 2 points in explosives<br/>- impress the librarian with your knowledge of the Dewey Decimal System so that she's distracted whilst your friends steal a book<br/>- at a pinch chat up the librarian and get a date with him<br/>- get the librarian as a connection serving as a pool of library use points, someone who can do research whilst you're chasing off chasing Hastur (is that three times in this thread now? Shouldn't he appear in the internet or something?).<br/>- ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255881/#Comment_255881" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T02:45:51+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  2:45AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>As well as differentiating characters, one of the main reasons is spotlight management.

I mean, are there really people out there whose primary source of fun is the fact they're they're the "fingerprint guy".  They get to have that moment where the clue gets passed TO THEM.

When you make your character, you get to decide whether you want to buy interpersonal skills, academic skills and other skills. Some players want lots of spotlight time, others less. That said, almost every skill (using special benefits) can result in a scene or roleplaying session, with flashbacks, using your skills to impress others with similar skills, or coming up with a new and interesting way to get info. Yes, even with fingerprinting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255882/#Comment_255882" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T03:06:00+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  3:06AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a quote which might help:<br/><br/>"Investigative scenarios are not about finding clues. They are about interpreting the clues you do find."<br/>Figuring out the puzzle is hard enough for a group of armchair detectives, without someone withholding half the pieces from them. GUMSHOE, therefore, makes the finding of clues all but automatic, as long as you get to the right place in the story and have the right ability. That\u2019s when the fun part begins, when the players try to put the components of the puzzle together."<br/><br/>I'd add one proviso to this - if the investigation is just background to the game you are trying to play, you don't even have to interpret the clues. How much puzzling you lay on the players is up to you.<br/><br/>Also, we keep talking about special benefits of point spends. Here's a selection I put together for Trail:<br/><br/>The benefit gives you an advantage in a future contest of General abilities.<br/>\u2022 you find your petrol tank has been punctured before you drive the vehicle<br/>\u2022 you discover that Shoggoths are affected by electricity, before you encounter one<br/>\u2022 you notice that there is a hole in the fence around the back of the complex or that the guards go off-duty at 6.00pm<br/>\u2022 the plans show that the bomb must remain horizontal if you are not to trigger it<br/>\u2022 Credit Rating might get you access to an NPC psychoanalyst or doctor.<br/><br/>The benefit gives a favorable impression to supporting characters.<br/>\u2022 you recognize and recover stolen artwork for the original owner, who will then be more inclined to help you<br/>\u2022 you spend points to discover a hidden room where there is a hostage who can either give clues or even help with General abilities.<br/>\u2022 You spend Credit Rating to cover up mistakes or buy your way past those who stand in your way<br/><br/>The benefit can lead to a flashback scene.<br/>\u2022 you find an insect and receive a flash back to a time you were in the Amazon basin, alone, with one of the creatures crawling up your leg \u2013 it wasn\u2019t poisonous after all.<br/>\u2022 you get your clue the form of a recalled lecture given by your mentor <br/><br/>Point spends can help you resolve a moral dilemma. If your character finds the action required to get a<br/>Core Clue distasteful you might make a point spend to avoid this.<br/>\u2022 Intimidating a local might get you a core clue for free, but a two point Reassurance spend on the same local could get you the same information without upsetting your source.<br/>\u2022 Flattery, followed by a night of debauchery, might get you a core clue, but if this offends your Investigator\u2019s moral (or aesthetic) sensibilities, a Credit Rating spend (to get into a showplace restaurant or dance hall) might get you the same information.<br/><br/>Extra point spends might speed up an investigation<br/>\u2022 a Bureaucracy spend supplemented by Flattery might get the photographs processed a day earlier, your car repaired more quickly,<br/>\u2022 the mysterious delay in processing your visa application might disappear with a Credit Rating spend.<br/><br/>A point spend might get you some dedicated pool point<br/>\u2022 A Library Use spend might allow you to find a book which gives you a History (New England) dedicated point pool.<br/><br/>An Technical spend spend might allow you to create a notable work. An Academic spend, to write an influential paper or join an appropriate society<br/>\u2022 An Art spend would allow you to create a sculpture or painting<br/>\u2022 A Geology spend gets your paper on anamolous artifacts found in Archaean slate published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255885/#Comment_255885" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T03:23:39+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  3:23AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems to me like the core issue here is whether and how and where those things Simon lists actually matter in playing the game. My impression after a read-through was that while the game regiments player activities with point-spends and such, it doesn't really do anything to systematize the impact those various clues and other benefits on Simon's list will have on the game. So in that regard it's business as usual, up to you as the GM to make sure everybody feels like they're accomplishing something with their spent points. To parallelize the latest conflict resolution discussion, it's a clear case of explicit task resolution without a conflict resolution back-up to ensure that the tasks resolved by point spends have any impact on what the players actually care about in the game.<br/><br/>On the one hand I really appreciate that, insofar as I understand, ToC has an organic, interactive procedure for what happens in the game. I like the idea that you can spend your points in stupid and useless ways, because that means that the choices you make as a player matter. On the other hand, contrary rhetoric is also thick in the air whenever GUMSHOE is discussed; a competing idea seems to be that it doesn't really matter what you do in the game, as the railroad tracks have been well-placed and mostly you're just there to add some color to the proceedings. I don't have any particular stake on which is the real ToC, but it seems to me that there is some interpretative tension around the issue when people try to figure out the game. This can be seen in how much theory terminology specifically related to narrativist games has been thrown about around a game that to me seems obviously, completely simulationism-facilitating.<br/><br/>Me, I'd love to get to actually play the game any which way, almost. I probably should start a special group for this so I'd get to enjoy the textures, sights and sounds of classical Cthulhu gaming once more. It's likely that I'd get mad as a hatter with the nitpicky character modeling action the game has going in it, of course, but I guess insanity is one of the goals in this sort of gaming, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256032/#Comment_256032" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T16:03:47+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  4:03PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>. . . if I look at some adventures, the clues are mostly pieces of information, rather than things</blockquote>I use this exact schema in Delve on the largest scale, when players are picking between missions.  Whatever they pick, they'll find the color or promise that led them to their choice, <i>plus</i> they'll find the next clue along their current trail of magical discovery.<br/><br/>I don't do this on the smaller level of player investigations, because some degree of "I challenge you to find the right answer" adds to the experience.  <br/><br/>Anyway, that last is <i>clearly</i> not part of ToC, so yeah, floating the answers into convenient locations in the fiction makes sense to me.

Sorry I seem to have missed the bulk of it.<br/><br/>I ran a published Call of Cthulhu campaign using Trail last year, a game I'm pretty passionate about. I introduced it to our then newly-formed group, some of whom had played lots of Call of Cthulhu before, others not much of any game. <br/><br/>Nobody had any problem figuring out Investigative abilities. That may have been because I was clear in explaining how I understand them to work: areas of expertise to distinguish each character and hang background on; resource management for additional benefits; and player currency for narrating great stuff: "I make it so, Keeper, with this, mine very last point."<br/><br/>We had a lot of great moments where players hit all these bases. <br/><br/>The Captain was using his mathematical background to drive his way into Xothian semantic-geometric madness, and decided to publish some articles while he was at it. It didn't do anything particularly for the game; it was just cool. <br/><br/>That player had also developed points in Dreaming, which I treated as a General ability that worked as Investigative also, \xe0 la Mechanical Repair. He made a big Investigative spend of Dreaming points to attack a wizard in the Dreaming (benefit). The wizard died, but her body in the material world was still acting as the focus for a summoning spell. The Captain, riding the Stability and Sanity loss roller coaster of all this Dreaming and magic, went on to have the wizard's body cut up with welding torches and dumped in Sydney harbor. All a roleplaying decision, colored by his Investigative ability background and in-play events.<br/><br/>Another character, the gangster Finnean, used 3 or 4 points of Streetwise to call in every favor he had among the criminals of New York: called them in to assemble an army of hoods to take out the Cult of the Bloody Tongue... incidentally, since Trail lacks a mass combat system, we just collaboratively narrated our way through an enormous gun- and dynamite-fight to get to what we really wanted, which was the big crazy Mythos reveal for that part of the campaign (Masks of Nyarlathotep with some alterations).<br/><br/>Now, a lot of this happened because that was how I read Investigative spends as working. I'd picked up a bit of a sense of player narrative control somewhere and read it into the ToC rules. It's not entirely there: most of the spends for benefits as written are GM-planned benefits. But it made sense, and nobody had a problem with that part of the system.<br/><br/>The part of the system my players didn't care for was the mechanic for General abilities. 1d6 + X against a difficulty? Bo-ring! Short, flat range of outcomes, no fumbles, no critical hits or exploding dice, and too granular. What they *did* like was the guarantee of success at actions they were very skilled in, until fatigued; and when we had action sequences, this worked very well for pacing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262662/#Comment_262662" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T05:07:05+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  5:07AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: YunusWesley</cite>The part of the system my players didn't care for was the mechanic for General abilities. 1d6 + X against a difficulty?

Roleplaying is a thing they do, and then event resolution is a thing they do. They're not fundamentally interconnected, other than the in-game-fiction dictating suitable skills (i.e. if I'm yelling at the crazy old lady to confess, I'm Interrogating).<br/><br/>I think it'd be too easy to lay that at the feet of "bad players" or whatever, but I think mechanically driven play introduces another factor: Rules-based economies provide a useful feedback loop for some kinds of players. It's not (necessarily) about acquiring I Win points, it's about receiving validation/reassurance that you're doing what the game wants you to do.<br/><br/>So, like, in ToC you have (for example) Pillars of Sanity. They're terrific! But right now they're just RPing flags. If you want to play toward them awesome, and if you don't then no big deal. They barely influence RPing decision-making until you've lost them all. So you have to rely on your fellow players to ooh and aah and let you know that playing toward your Pillars is cool. They also have to provide social-level validation to the GM that challenging those Pillars is cool.<br/><br/>OTOH, you have Drives. Now Drives are very potent, since now you're faced with a really tough decision: Do I ignore my Drive and suffer the Stability loss? Is my Stability kind of shaky right now, and can I get some back by following my Drive?<br/><br/>Granted many players simply do not care about/for the mechanics influencing their RPing. Some do. I'd even go so far as to say many/most RPers are more viscerally motivated by mechanics than character fidelity. So that's kind of tough to get one's head around in a game like ToC, which is very very hands-off when it comes to Playing Your Role.<br/><br/>On that note, we've been contemplating ways to hack Pillars so that good things happen when you play toward them and bad things happen when you play against them. We're not sure what those would be, yet.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262766/#Comment_262766" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T11:10:22+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 11:10AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 11:10AM by PaulB.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Yeah, but capitalism-motivated play doesn't fuck with virtue-motivated play people at all.

Sanity degrades over a much longer term than Stability, but cannot be regained.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262933/#Comment_262933" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T04:37:02+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  4:37AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, like, in ToC you have (for example) Pillars of Sanity. They're terrific! But right now they're just RPing flags. If you want to play toward them awesome, and if you don't then no big deal. They barely influence RPing decision-making until you've lost them all. So you have to rely on your fellow players to ooh and aah and let you know that playing toward your Pillars is cool. They also have to provide social-level validation to the GM that challenging those Pillars is cool.<br/><br/>OTOH, you have Drives. Now Drives are very potent, since now you're faced with a really tough decision: Do I ignore my Drive and suffer the Stability loss? Is my Stability kind of shaky right now, and can I get some back by following my Drive?</blockquote>\nNow this is interesting.<br/><br/>I'm getting my ToC gear on, and while Pillars, Sources, and Drives are all awesome in terms of concept, I feel very unenthused about the explicit mechanics associated with Sources and Drives.<br/><br/>To me, it's more like saying too much beyond "This shit (Pillars, Sources, and Drive) is important to you!" is ... too much.<br/><br/>That level of guidance I can play with. The distinction between Hard and Soft drivers is just noise that hides the beauty of the explicit IC motivation to Go And Do The Stuff PCs Are Supposed To Do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11455/trail-of-cthulhu-players-end-scene-power" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11455/trail-of-cthulhu-players-end-scene-power" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11455/trail-of-cthulhu-players-end-scene-power/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11455%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11455%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
