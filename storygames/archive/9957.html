Y'all're new here. But we've been here since Zero, and tomorrow's the first day o' 1993, so y'all can do the math.  That's a goodly amount o' time, time enough that we figured out the Law, and any as didn't figure it out, well, we leave their ashes where they fall. That's the Law too, Law 3. "Three. He that stirs the ashes of the iniquitous, falls iniquitous among them."<br/><br/>The Husk is good to us, and y'all must know that, came here for Husk's Peace, may it embrace and keep you. Every crime, every single one, is instantly met with righteous justice. Now in the beginnin', when there was some as was wicked among the Ancestors, they didn't even know what a crime was. They only found out when ashes settled where a man once stood in his transgression. But the righteous among the Ancestors, they started writin' it down. And this here, this is the Law, as was handed down to us by the Husk, written in the ends of the Unlawful.  I ain't gonna read it to y'all, but y'all oughta read it, even iffen y'ain't stayin'.  "One. He that raises a knife against his fellow, falls in his wrath." That's righteous justice, that ought properly to be brought to the world outside. "Ninety-four. He that enters the High Room, falls on its threshold." Well, sure, that's easy 'nuff for outsiders!<br/><br/>So, Law One Hundred Twelve provides as we ought to welcome outsiders, and trust in the peace of the Husk, may it embrace and keep us, to protect us from them as would transgress against us, to make us strong in our hospitality. Let me take y'all to the Hostelry \u2014 there'll be a copy of the Law in the drawer...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221263/#Comment_221263" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T18:23:08+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  6:23PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although most systems on the husk were destroyed on impact, one system, the universal translation field, still operates.

My father sees a silver and marble statue who sings soft secrets on the wind that tell him what the weather will be like tomorrow.  My mother sees a cast-off skin of a large cosmic snake and she can sometimes break off a piece of and use that skin to make the quilts she sells to gunfighter to protect them from all but the most righteous of bullets.  She also says it leaks poison from deep sacs, but she has not yet brought any back - she fears to anger its progenitor, wherever in the sky he may dance.<br><br>I hide what I see.  I tell people I see a mist of purple clouds that is struck through with lightning and floating golden orbs with ruins written upon them.  They nod at this and pity me a bit, for it seems I get no benefit from my interface with the Husk.  In truth, that is the vision of the Husk an old traveler told me as he died in a hospice I worked in as a boy.  He was carried away, he claimed in his last moments, by one of those orbs.<br><br>I lie because I have the worst vision of all.  You see, I do not see the Husk at all.  I pray I am not the victim of some prophesy or worse, the one person in the world forsaken by the Husk and its gifts.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221513/#Comment_221513" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T18:12:04+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:12PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2009 6:14PM by JuddG.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oops - removed double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221514/#Comment_221514" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T18:27:13+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  6:27PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were told that there were monsters hiding in the ship's depths.

Protection from winds<br/>2.  Rain shadow / runoff (the ship itself is tall and cool, and condensation runs through it from the other side and runs down the inner side in rivulets)<br/>3.  Crater (oasis where the water gathers from the ship's runoff)<br/>4.  Natural fortification.  <br/>5.  "We dream of a time before Wasters like us ever found the ship, when the ones who lived here thought it might run again, before its engines cooled, before birds used it as a place to roost and moss grew on its hull." (Paraphrasing Judd)<br/>6.  The people of Husk have heard of Wingsfall and Shadowspan, to the east and south, but no Waster has been to those places in living memory.  A few Knocks made the journey from Shadowspan to here years back, but they said it's not worth it - they say those places were just like Husk, but with more murder.<br/>7.  It used to be that pieces of the ship could do amzing things, but it's been centuries since the whole ship was gutted for parts.
