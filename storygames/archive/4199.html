I'm not sure why, but I assume it was something like: "That player doesn't even care enough to make his own choices - he's not playing his character at all!"<br/><br/>To me, the point was the challenge of playing something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dice_Man" rel="nofollow">The Dice Man</a> (though I hadn't heard of the book at the time).

I can't tell you why your player did it, but my protocol for deciding what a PC should do is usually something like (subject to social constraints):<br/><br/>1. If I have a gut, intuitive feeling about what my character should do, I go with.<br/>2. If nothing intuitive comes to me I ask "what logically would my character do?"<br/>3. If 1 and 2 don't work I ask "what would be cool for the story?"<br/>4. If I can't think of anything for 1,2, or 3, I then use a randomizer - either flip a coin, or (more recently) look at a Tarot card.<br/><br/>Now, if I have a character that I have thought alot about, it's more likely I'll stop at step one or two. If I've been handed a brand new character with negligible background, I'm more likely to slip to stage 3 or 4 (usually stopping at 3). But in both cases there's always a chance I slip to stage 4. Hmm upon reflection, I'll slip to stage 4 about once every 20 hours of game play when I've had at least 4+ hours of prep time for a character, and once about every 4 hours of gameplay with zero preparation and background.<br/><br/>It's an interesting question of whether a mechanic other than high-low or Tarot-read could be used to refine the process more... but at least for me by the time I start looking for a mechanic, I've already pretty much decided that I don't actually care. Maybe some of this is mechanics are for when either two-players disagree on what should happen, or one player is taking on the responsibility of adding complications/costs to actions. But if a player with default authority over a character doesn't care what should happen, then there's no player-player conflict, and there's no price or setback she'd be willing to play.<br/><br/>PC: um, I guess I act bravely<br/>GM: But only if your act of bravery puts your friends at risk. Is it worth it to you?<br/>PC: Oh, then, um, I guess I don't care.

It was essentially a coin flip to decide, as a player, what he was going to decide to do with his character.<br/><br/>I personally don't have a problem with it.  Perhaps the player felt that this was a pivotal moment in his cowardace, and the die roll reflected his internal struggle.  He, as a player, wanted to join the fight, but to simply do so would devalue his choice to be a coward in the first place.  As either choice he would make would thus be "wrong", he took the choice out of his own hands.  It's just conflict resolution, only between himself and himself.

He had the authority. So he had the authority to roll that d6. That means, this wasn't a new mechanic at all. He could have called his grandma, too.<br/><br/>I guess he used the die in the best possible way: To elect one from two interesting options.

Usually it's when neither choice sounds good but I have to decide something. I don't see a problem at all with doing it for a game situation where you can't decide what your character would do.<br/><br/>I also don't see this as "inventing a new mechanic." It sounds a little overreactionary to me. He just rolled a die to break an out of charact/ in character indecision, he didn't jot down a new house rule.<br/><br/>I guess my primary concern is: why does this upset you? If you don't like that he appeared to be uninvested in the scene, you should probably ignore the die roll part of it and find out why it is he wasn't invested in the scene. If it's not a common occurrence, you might even just ignore it. Sometimes people aren't invested, and sometimes they can't decide what they want to do.<br/><br/>If you're more concerned about the die roll itself, because of the "inventing mechanics" part, I'd suggest one of two things. First, you could let it go. Unless it was somehow detrimental to the game session, this is the one I'd choose. Second, you could add your own mechanic for later. Since you said this is a homebrew system, that might not be hard to do, but make sure either a) it only triggers when the player wants it to, or b) the players don't mind a system that will sometimes dictate their actions to them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>I think this might be the root of your 'problem'.

Alasdair's the one who bugged me. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> All in all, we've had about two dozen game sessions. This was our second session of this game.<br/><br/>The system is a descendant of TSOY, with no GM. Players frame their scenes, pick someone else to be their conflict-wallah, negotiate towards a conflict and stakes, and roll (freeform traits)+(broad pools)+(setting motifs)+(gift dice from the rest of the table). <br/><br/>We'd had a few moments during the two sessions where I wasn't convinced Alasdair was taking the responsibilities seriously. I didnt think he understood how responsible he was for his own fun, there being no GM (though wed done some GM-less stuff before).<br/><br/>For example, we built the setting as a group in the first session. We wanted steampunk. Al suggested we play in a non-Euro setting. Calum suggested Western. We all liked the idea. We settled on elements of the setting as a group then went to character generation. Al wanted to play a member of the (British) House of Lords in India. Wtf?<br/><br/>In a battle scene, Jenny described a cool bit where two ninja masters met, speaking one word to each other. And everyone around hushed... and Al piped up with an inappropriate comment from his character. We discussed it, and he very much wanted his character to blunder about. We discussed this as a group and the comment stood. I wasn't happy with it, as it seemed to mess with Jenny's scene setting and establishment of mood.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that Alasdair did have a sense of mood and genre, but it wasn't shared entirely. He framed one scene, describing at length the tablecloth in the dining car of a train (for 15 minutes) before describing his character's action. There were some eyes rolled round the table. <br/><br/>(I'm more of a loudmouth than the other two players, and tend to push for meatier conflicts and tighter scene frames. So I do get frustrated at what felt like waffling)<br/><br/>The final scene was an epic, group-wide showdown with an immortal ninja guy. Alasdair took his turn. He wanted to make two rolls - one to see if his character got involved, or simply hid. One to see how the fight went if he did get involved. Instead of a normal conflict roll for the first choice, he wanted to basically 'flip a coin' - a 50:50 chance on a d10.<br/><br/>I stopped him and explained that breaking the scene into two rolls felt like prolonging the inevitable. He was vacillating. And it bugged me that the first roll was wasn't a <i>statement</i>. It felt arbitrary. And it felt distant from the character and the story.<br/><br/>As Per says above, "I can get my head around the "player didnt know if his character would get involved" bit". I still don't understand it.<br/><br/>Joe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94213/#Comment_94213" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T13:33:57+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  1:33PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2007 1:34PM by 1of3.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm Stefan.
