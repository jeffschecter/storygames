Perfect is a game about normal people driven to crime by a dystopic Victorian empire. It's a game about passionately rocking out against the system, while the system attempts to track you down and stick needles in your eyes and reprogram you.<br/><br/>About fifteen months after releasing it, I stopped producing copies of Perfect. I felt like the system had holes, and like the physical product wasn't as fantastic as it could ultimately be. I had an awesome game that lacked polish.<br/><br/>I want to share with you the <a href="http://joepub.livejournal.com/767.html" rel="nofollow">current version</a> of the game, which I feel is significantly close to where I want it to be. The writing isn't pretty and complete in the playtest version, but I don't feel like it necessarily should be. It's what you need to play, and to play as I envision the game working. I'd love critique, feedback, playtesting or questions! You all rock.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145791/#Comment_145791" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T17:46:47+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  5:46PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i picked up Perfect last year at Gen Con after hearing about it on a podcast and I was super excited about it, but never quite got around to running it.  so i'll be looking forward to reading over the new version as soon as i can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145904/#Comment_145904" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T22:29:40+00:00" title="May 24, 2008 10:29PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, I'm glad to hear it.<br/>Definitely bring your copy of Perfect v1 to the table if you plan to run this, and just have it there as a visual aid. The cover illustration captures EVERYTHING, and it captures it PERFECTLY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
