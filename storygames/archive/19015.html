If you die by falling into a pit, that's just how it goes. The whole is the working out of DM-mediated physics and player-skill.</li>\n</ul>\nIn all of this, there seems a fair bit of nostalgia, but I used to play D&amp;D from the late 70s onwards, and for me it was a bit different:<br/><br/>1) When my Dad first bought the game and introduced it to myself and my brother, none of our characters ever died. The emphasis was on narration and atmosphere and fantasy as a source of wonder.<br/><br/>2) At school, we had a lunchtime club, and our dungeons were rarely lethal. At university I played in a campaign that lasted years, helping people in a village who were dying due to an ancient god rising. My favourite books were Legends and Lore (particularly the Melnibonean section)  - and I tended to steer clear of DMs who regularly killed characters. For me, the attraction was the sense of wonder and dramatic sweep of it all.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying this isn't compatible with the OSR style (I was amazed by the thread about the guy running around with a map, for example). But I don't remember playing that way very much myself.<br/><br/>I wonder what people's thoughts are around:<br/><br/>a) How much the style discussed in these OSR threads is new, as opposed to the dominant game type of the time?<br/><br/>b) How much it naturally emerges from the ruleset (rather than, say, the culture of the people round the table)?<br/><br/>The reason I'm asking is that I'm actually really nostalgic for my old way of playing, but I can so clearly see the OSR gametype is coherent that I'm beginning to wonder if I was trying to bang a square peg into a round hole for all these years. Do you think it's possible to take, say, the 74 D&amp;D ruleset and play other ways coherently, or will the rules always fight you unless you drift them, and you're better off picking up a more modern game?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424600/#Comment_424600" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T05:37:32+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  5:37AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're definitely better off picking up a more modern game if what you want is novelistic fantasy fiction, which is essentially what you're describing. Dungeon World or Burning Wheel are my top picks though there are no doubt many good choices.<br/><br/>I think what you experienced is quite common, of course. Given the trappings of play\u2014dudes with swords and spells going into dangerous places full of monsters\u2014*of course* people wanted to get Tolkien out of that! But, no, the rules don't really support it. The point of the OSR is to see what would happen if we actually played those old games by the rules as written. Exactly how common it was for people back then to play things that way, rather than drift Tolkien-ward, is hard to say without sociological data.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424601/#Comment_424601" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T05:43:00+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  5:43AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2013 5:58AM by GB_Steve.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's sounds close to my experience except for your last point.

Of course certain aspects of the large and varied OSR are new (or new when compared to mid-70s roleplaying), but the basic premise comes from the early 70s.\n<blockquote>b) How much it naturally emerges from the ruleset (rather than, say, the culture of the people round the table)?</blockquote>\nPlay the rules exactly as written and you'll get what you put in your bullet points. Especially with Basic D&amp;D, as it's the clearest statement of rules. The culture of the people around the table always plays a part, of course, but the OSR is generally using these rules for what they're good at.\n<blockquote>Do you think it's possible to take, say, the 74 D&amp;D ruleset and play other ways coherently, or will the rules always fight you unless you drift them, and you're better off picking up a more modern game?<br/></blockquote>\nNot really, "fight you" is putting it mildly, and you're better off playing a game that supports the way you want to play, modern or not. You, for example, should probably play Dungeon World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424608/#Comment_424608" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T07:19:42+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  7:19AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of what happens in the game depends on the scenario design.

Back then, we couldn't run to the internet to consult the "Authorities" every time we ran into a blank in the rules (of which there were <i>many</i>; so we made stuff up. That became <i>our</i> version of the game. It wasn't Rules As Written so much as "These rules are intended as guidelines" {pg 41}.<br/><br/>  The OSR seems to be a particular manifesto surrounding the rules. Some of the bloggers I've been reading weren't even born when I and my friends were slaying dragons. This is <i>not</i> an old curmudgeon criticism. Hell, play the game however you want; that was kinda the point. Although, ironically, it's certainly not the OSR stand nor was it Gygax's later "Use only Official TSR Products" stand.

I think both modes were supported equally well, or equally poorly; the GM was encouraged to make up mechanics on the fly for anything that came up that wasn't covered in the rules, or just pick a target number on D20 and go with that, as I recall, so you could make the game as lethal or forgiving as you liked. <br/><br/>I'm not sure you could do that now with the average set of players one gets, the expectations people bring to the table are different and people take the rules a lot more seriously these days IMO.<br/>EDIT: very hard to post to this thread without feeling like Grandpa Simpson complaining about things were better back during WWII!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424618/#Comment_424618" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T11:30:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2013 11:30AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>a) How much the style discussed in these OSR threads is new, as opposed to the dominant game type of the time?</blockquote>\nFew people tell me that they they'd have played like this in the '70s; many have told me that their play was more varied, experimental, meandering or outright contrary to the approaches that are dominant in the OSR. On the other hand, the textual sources are much more supportive, the time period saw the publication of many, many rpg texts that don't make even a little sense unless you assume a clear challenge-orientation to them. This makes me conclude that while D&amp;D was used for all sorts of creative agendas early on (makes perfect sense - there were few alternative games to go to), the core culture of developers, branching out from Gygax's social and geographical proximity, played in a more OSR-like style than the hobby on average.<br/><br/>It should be remembered that the OSR is technically not defined by a particular creative agenda or technical solution, though; as I see it, the OSR guys have historically been just messing about with their favourite game, and they've found each other by the virtue of similar surface color - they all dig "old D&amp;D". I expect that their thing gains in definition over time, of course, and already one can say with justification that the OSR is starting to crystallize some dogma about what is old school and what isn't. They are in a fundamentally different situation form the '70s roleplayers due to the opportunities they have for comparing games and creative purposes against each other, understanding the full scope of possibilities roleplaying has to offer; D&amp;D has never been as sharply defined as it is when it can be laid down against all these other games.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say that the challenge-based playstyle that is so prominent in the OSR was without question present in the '70s, but it was also without question not the only way the game was played. Whether it was "dominant" would depend entirely on with whom you played. For me it is sufficient to say that it's the playstyle that is the most interesting of those practiced at the time, simply because it's the only one that went effectively extinct in the rpg publishing culture later on; I can get better story-telling play out of any number of games today, while old D&amp;D still stands as a competitive classic of challenge-based roleplaying. (Of course, if I'm wrong about this and there is some amazing other way to play D&amp;D where it also rules the roost as the best game ever, I'm all ears.)\n<blockquote>b) How much it naturally emerges from the ruleset (rather than, say, the culture of the people round the table)?</blockquote>\nI'd say it's pretty evenly balanced between these; I would not expect the D&amp;D rules, skimpy and prone to irrelevant mechanizations as they are, to lead anybody into applying them in this manner without other support. On the other hand, I do think that this is easily the most natural way to use those rules. So I'd say D&amp;D is like a poncho: if you don't know what that is, you well might end up using it as a wrap-on skirt, but once you encounter a real wrap skirt you'll realize how clumsy, over-sized and heavy your poncho is, and once you see some people wearing ponchos you'll realize that this was actually the way this thing was supposed to be used in the first place.<br/><br/>The way I look at this as a game designer is that D&amp;D is very strongly supportive of its mode of play, but the game just has not been written down in a satisfactory manner yet. When I look at D&amp;D as an abstract entity devoid of the specific foibles of individual game texts, I see a game that is very coherent, and one that should provide its experience reliably. The reason for why it doesn't historically is that it's been written in muddled ways (or perhaps in out-dated ways, in case of the best versions - they're perfectly playable, but you <i>still</i> can't understand them unless you're lucky or you've seen somebody wear the poncho correctly), even if play has been clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_424621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424621/#Comment_424621" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T13:10:30+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  1:10PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I started playing when I was 12, and I didn't play in a game run by a DM who had not learned the game from me until I was 19, I think.  So there was no input from any kind of gamer culture during that period, and what I knew I got from the rules and other texts.  The OSR style is nevertheless largely familiar and recognisable to me and similar to the way I played, or at least, started out playing, so I would suport the idea that it is emergent from the rules themselves.  I mean, this is a game in which you are enouraged to buy a 10' pole and 50' of rope and iron pitons, even if only because they are among the things expressly listed as adventuring supplies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424629/#Comment_424629" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T16:12:59+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  4:12PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, there's something that has been itching at the back of my brain as I read these OSR threads making the case for a very directly challenged based approach to play.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure how to phrase it though. I started thinking about it when I checked the links to <i>The West Marches</i> campaign someone has been running ( sorry, I forget who exactly).<br/><br/> Lemme try anyway...( takes deep breath)<br/><br/>It seems like the OSR crowd making the case for challenge-based play is only focusing on one part of that stuff and there's another, really important, part being ignored that has to do with the big pool of players.<br/><br/>The neutral refereeing, the playing hard as the opposition, the sandbox-y, Go Explore, get rich or die trying, the world exists outside of the characters as its own thing parts...that seems dead on.<br/><br/>But...it makes more sense in the context of that big pool of players, all interacting and with (at minimum) friendly rivalry/smack-talk going on in a bigger social context. And really, I do mean <i>at minimum</i>. That whole thing about advancing your character up to warlord level ( or choosing not to do that and instead staying an independent wild card while other people are settling down to become warlords), is somehow really important in all of this.<br/><br/>It des seem a bit underexplored, even in the OSR circles. ACKS is the one game I'm familiar with that touches on it mechanically ( not counting actual forms of TSR D&amp;D), and even that doesn't seem to talk much about the implications of it.<br/><br/>Love to hear other people's thoughts on this aspect. I can start a new thread if it is too tangential to this one. Thought it was appropriate though if we were talking about emergence and challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424632/#Comment_424632" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T16:39:59+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  4:39PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been trying to develop a huge pool of players all with characters in a shared world for many years now.

Taken for granted, perhaps? I mean, some people do play in isolated cliques, but others play in circles, and I myself play in circles, and I don't recognize that I would be somehow ignoring the social dynamics of this.<br/><br/>Setting that up, though, it's basically exactly the same as if you were just setting up an isolated clique, at least in my experience. The phenomenon of growing circles of associated GMs, several concurrently running campaigns, complex character stables and so on, all associated with a healthy local D&amp;D ecosystem, seems to me like an emergent outcome of success. It takes little except that your game is energetic enough to attract new blood regularly, and your players are good enough to decide to turn to GMing for a change of pace. Do that for a year or two, and you have that big pool of players with all the associated phenomena.<br/><br/>Why it doesn't work this way with other roleplaying games aside from D&amp;D, that's an interesting question. I would say that it's because D&amp;D is so massively campaign-focused, which makes it more rewarding when you put more work into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424637/#Comment_424637" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T18:44:33+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  6:44PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a> stop by New Mexico something <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> we have this sort of thing going.

You can add newbies to an existing group and the structure allows them to find a role right away without worrying too much about roleplaying -- if you're playing a fighter, you can be taciturn and focus on making shield walls with the paladin, and it works great. There isn't as much of the "but what do I <i>do</i>?" problem that you get so much with newer RPGs. To use a Ron Edwards-style musical metaphor, D&amp;D is like the 12-bar blues, it's easy to get the group working together in D&amp;D mode.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP" title="JimLotFP"><img alt="JimLotFP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">JimLotFP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424650/#Comment_424650" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T01:20:17+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  1:20AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An important thing that people tend to overlook is that a lot of what developed into the "OSR" style was intentionally emphasizing the differences (real and perceived) between "old school D&amp;D" and 3rd edition D&amp;D, and to a lesser degree the other popular games out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424657/#Comment_424657" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T06:42:20+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  6:42AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't so much thinking about the ease of slotting people into a team on any night, although that is very much true, especially with a biggish pool of players.<br/><br/>I was thinking about the way conflicts develop between the players within the campaign world.<br/><br/>At the simplest level, it's rivalry for score: My character has more XPs than yours.

But just like the Italian Renaissance it is not a recreation of the past. It is a reinvention for the present drawing on clues and inspiration from old (and for some) unknown and forgotten things.

Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons was a response to Dungeons &amp; Dragons and was wildly popular with the existing audience of roleplayers at the time because it gave them something more than basic D&amp;D. Many players at the time wanted more, or suspected more was possible, is what I'm saying. Now those of us looking back decades later - and having played many games and systems that evolved from the ancestral beginnings of RPGs - are looking back with an enormous amount of context that didn't exist back then. I became frustrated by basic D&amp;D and even AD&amp;D because I sensed and wanted more from my gaming. I got all that eventually. But now with the benefit of all this surplus of RP goodness, I can look back on those simpler times and appreciate the elegance of the system and enjoy them in a way I didn't in the day. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm fascinated by how I have come around to enjoying something now when I found it limiting and frustrating when the only games available were much simpler.<br/><br/>(Topic for another thread might be how certain rulesets and styles suit the psychological needs of the gamers and how those needs change as we get older. I wanted (needed?) something very different from my RPs when I was in my teens and early twenties than I want or need now.)<br/><br/>Honoring the OP:<br/><br/>a) How much the style discussed in these OSR threads is new, as opposed to the dominant game type of the time? - I'd maybe add my POV is the appreciation for the style is mostly new and that the dominant game type of the time varied widely as we were stumbling about exploring this RP landscape. Some folks ran the games as intended but most the folks I knew were busy experimenting with house rules as we were exploring and probably some of those experiments resulted in new game systems that continued the evolution of RPGs.<br/><br/>b) How much it naturally emerges from the ruleset (rather than, say, the culture of the people round the table)? - I now realize that if you do stick to the ruleset as given, and let it do its thing, it can provide a rewarding experience. Again, expectations play a huge role here... if what you yearn for is something more/else/different, you'd do well to try a different rules set. Which again was the impetus to house-rule the sh!t out of the games were were playing back in the '70s and '80s. Remember the ruleset is only a bunch of inert tools - the style of play might be directionally informed by the rules but only springs into existence when the people round the table breathe life into it.

Also everything I've read indicates that almost all the groups that played that way had a direct oral/gaming tradition reaching back to Gygax.  On the other hand almost every group that did not have a direct tradition that reached back to Gygax played the way you did.\n<blockquote>b) How much it naturally emerges from the ruleset (rather than, say, the culture of the people round the table)?</blockquote>\nDefine "The ruleset".  Because the ruleset was written to encourage such play and was playtested extremely heavily with it (with the most obvious example being XP for GP).  On the other hand the description of the game in the books does not lead to this style, which is why people will play the way they think it reads (and because they find your old way of playing more fun).\n<blockquote>The reason I'm asking is that I'm actually really nostalgic for my old way of playing, but I can so clearly see the OSR gametype is coherent that I'm beginning to wonder if I was trying to bang a square peg into a round hole for all these years. Do you think it's possible to take, say, the 74 D&amp;D ruleset and play other ways coherently, or will the rules always fight you unless you drift them, and you're better off picking up a more modern game?</blockquote>\nI'd have expected that you were better off picking up a more modern game.\n<blockquote>I have been trying to develop a huge pool of players all with characters in a shared world for many years now. It's hard. But I absolutely think it's going to have a huge impact no matter what type of game we're playing.  So far only LARPers seem interested in this and they'd rather go LARP. (How dare they!!)</blockquote>\nWhat do you mean only LARPers?  It's one of the defining features of Eve Online (and to a lesser extent most other MMOs, MUDs, and MUSHes).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424772/#Comment_424772" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T10:41:29+00:00" title="November 25, 2013 10:41AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect that JD was thinking of the people who do face to face gaming that he knows personally.

So, yes?\n<blockquote><br/>JimLotFP:<br/>An important thing that people tend to overlook is that a lot of what developed into the "OSR" style was intentionally emphasizing the differences (real and perceived) between "old school D&amp;D" and 3rd edition D&amp;D, and to a lesser degree the other popular games out there. </blockquote>\nA solid point I hadn't considered, and important to context of these things. A lot of the OSR stuff people are talking about in these threads is one part of old school gaming, expanded upon, and in contrast to stuff that's more current design/playstyle-wise.<br/><br/>Looking backwards a bit:<br/><br/>So I'm pretty fascinated talked about in <i>Playing at the World</i>, how approaches and mechanics in games develop and evolve through accidents, quirks of fate, and a changing play context. And even how this stuff changes depending upon a player's age at any moment, life circumstances as they age, and contact with other gamers ( and what those gamers like and have experienced).<br/><br/>Of course, backtracking the changes is tricky with a bunch of different people doing stuff simultaneously and varied levels of contact between them.<br/><br/>For example, it took me a long time and a lot of consideration and pondering to figure out why D&amp;D took off with a segment of wargamers, how it tied into a bunch of different experimental approaches to minis wargaming, and what that means to how those early rules mechanics and approaches reflect that.<br/><br/>A lot of it is really non-obvious without the context of the social groups, the organization of play, and the environment.<br/><br/>Peculiar stuff like alignment, fast, random chargen, XPs for gold, differing advancement rates/level caps, sheer deadliness of combat, the end game warlordism, and neutral refereeing ( and what that even means exactly) make more sense once you know about that stuff. It also starts to make more sense about why people started moving away from those things(and related mechanics) as other factors in the environment changed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424773/#Comment_424773" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T10:55:22+00:00" title="November 25, 2013 10:55AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>D&amp;D was definitely a moving target.  I started playing in the late 70's / early 80's and the game was going through changes the whole time.  A large part of it was TSR trying to sell more product, new books to the same old customers but even the difference in the adventure modules was fascinating.  Compare "Keep on the Borderlands"  or the "Village of Homlet" with the Dragonlance series and it's just amazing how much the gameplay has changed even if the rules are still pretty similar.   Even the rules were changing 3d6 in order for generating ability scores changed when the AD&amp;D DM's guide came out with it's multiple methods and the inclusion of the optional "Death's door" option where 0 hp's didnt mean death.<br/><br/>I'm just speculating but I believe the "dominant form" of play was shifting over time and by the time Dragonlance came out it was much more like you describe where character death was rare and of course the downside was little opportunity for players to have an impact on the outcomes of the game.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424774/#Comment_424774" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T11:07:41+00:00" title="November 25, 2013 11:07AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently, character death became annoying in video games too, as they started moving to Save Game type mechanics and away from throw another quarter in the arcade machine and start completely over again when your last guy dies mechanics.<br/><br/>Heck, they pretty quickly moved away from that and simply to put another quarter in to keep playing from the point your last guys died in arcade games, much less home console games.<br/><br/>Again, I see some parallels between these things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426328/#Comment_426328" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T22:29:23+00:00" title="December 27, 2013 10:29PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a> stop by New Mexico something <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> we have this sort of thing going.

I am doing an AD&amp;D 1e revival game (my wife got me the Gygagx reprints of the three core books) and it is definitely not a game I would want to play normally, but fun as an experiment. I am making an effort to play it as written (since a lot of these more recent OSR threads, and some other discussions as well, demonstrated what play style these rules were supporting, I went for probably 20 years of gaming without ever having a clue what kind of game AD&amp;D 1e was trying to produce, lol).<br/>  There is an ability to create a story and for the players to engage in that creativity. But, for me, the lethality means that there is a lot of pointless deaths.
