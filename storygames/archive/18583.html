Just putting down my first thoughts, looking for some feedback, especially about the face card effects.  This is clearly influenced by Apocalypse World, but I don't think I want to use that engine.  <br/><br/><b>Set Up</b><br/>Players will create a pantheon of 12 gods (or use a sample pantheon).  Begin play by choosing a god to be your character's first patron, their sphere of influence (nature, death, war, love, sea, etc.), and defining a relationship between that god and another god (family, lovers, liege/vassal, indebted, rivals, enemies).<br/><br/>The Oracle (GM) records the pantheon, and the relationship web of the gods.  The Oracle's role is to interpret the will of the gods.<br/><br/>Characters begin with a few Traits:  Warfare, Wisdom, (Craft?), (Travel?), (Speech?), with values around 0-2 (up to +3 after experience), one patron god, and one gift from their patron god (skill at arms, toughness, great strength, helm of invisibility, cloak of animal form, winged horse, etc.)<br/><br/><b>Gameplay</b><br/>Characters are given quests either by a god, or a mortal (king, village elder, peasant asking for help, etc.)  According to the pantheon relationship map, which gods approve or disappove of this quest?<br/><br/>The Oracle describes initial challenges, probably with a finite amount of threat tokens for this mission (as in 3:16).  For example, sailing to the island will be threat 3, defeating the troll will be threat 2 (total threat 5 for the mission).<br/><br/>When characters attempt challenging actions, they roll 1d6+Trait (0-3).  <br/>6 =two successes.  Player describes two success effects ("yes and...").  Oracle removes two threat tokens.  Extraordinary human success.  <br/>4 =one success.  Player describes one success effect.  Oracle removes one threat token.  Normal human success.<br/>1-3 =failure, Oracle adds threat tokens, and introduces another complication or challenge (the troll is hidden in a dark cavern complex).<br/>Natural 1 =Tragedy.  As failure, but Oracle involves a new god in the quest (this troll is the son of the sea god) <br/><br/>When characters want to use their god's gift, they should describe how that gift helps them with this challenge.  The Oracle can say that particular gift is not applicable to this challenge, (helm of invisibility might help to fight the troll but it won't help you sail to the island).  If the gift applies, the player draws a playing card for that action, instead of rolling 1d6.  Card draw+Trait (0-3)<br/>8 =three successes.  Heroic success.  <br/>10 =four successes.  Legendary success.<br/>12 =five successes.  God-like success.  <br/>Ace, Joker =Tragedy.  <br/>Face cards =A god gets involved.  Each of the 12 gods is assigned to a face card.  <br/><br/>If you draw your patron god (the god who gave you this quest, or who gave you this gift), count as a draw of 10.  If this god also approves of your action, mark them as pleased.  If they disapprove of your action, still count as 10, but mark that god as offended.<br/><br/>If you draw an opposed god (the god this quest is against, a god you have offended, or an enemy of the god who granted you this power), count as a draw of 1/Ace/Tragedy.<br/><br/><b>Now here's the part I really want help with:</b><br/>If you draw any other god, consult the Oracle.  Does what we know about this god (sphere of influence and relationships) imply that they approve or disapporve of this action?  If there is a <i>strong, clear</i> reason for them to take sides in this challenge, count as either 10 or 1.  When in doubt, assume the god is neutral in this challenge.  <br/>Count neutral gods as 5.  That god is now watching the character.  The player should hold that card, and might now please or offend that god.  <br/><br/><b>Improvement</b><br/>At the end of the quest, characters can choose new gifts from gods that they pleased, or impressed.<br/>_______________________________________<br/><br/>The idea is that characters end up working for more than one god, and that while one god might approve of your actions, other gods might disapprove, and your card draw determines which god is watching.  I'd like to include mechanics for the relationship web between the gods to emerge from play, and for characters to be able to influence those relationships.  <br/><br/>Any thoughts?  Feedback is greatly appreciated, expecially about the neutral gods.  Thanks for reading!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave" title="SteveDave"><img alt="SteveDave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/267/nLSFO0MJD2Z0T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SteveDave">SteveDave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417822/#Comment_417822" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T14:53:32+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  2:53PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really depends upon what role the gods take in your game.

Can there be any relationship between god and mortal other than a god using a mortal as an instrument for their will?<br/>It seems like you could have to carefully define the mythos in order to make this work as you intend.  You could easily have a Lovecraftian concept of gods with the same rules and turn this into a horror game, or you could easily have a Nordic myth concept of gods and turn it into a tragedy themed game.

I imagined this with Greek-myth-inspired gods, but I want players to be able to create their own pantheons and mythos, so I could definitely see this working with a darker, more Lovecraftian feel.  I want the system to support gods who view mortals mostly as tools, pets, and playthings, but there should be room for gods to love mortals as well.<br/><br/>So, some further thoughts on face cards:<br/><br/>If you draw your patron god (the god who gave you this quest, or who gave you this gift), count as a draw of 10. If this god also approves of your action, mark them as pleased. If they disapprove of your action, still count as 10, but mark that god as offended.<br/><br/>If you draw an opposed god (the god this quest is against, a god you have offended, or an enemy of the god who granted you this power), count as a draw of 1/Ace/Tragedy.<br/><br/>If you draw any other god, consult the Oracle. <br/>-Is the action within or against the god's sphere of influence?  Count as either 10 or 1.<br/>-Does the god owe allegiance/favor to your patron god?  Count as 10, and remove that debt from the gods' web.<br/>-Does the god owe allegiance/favor to an enemy/opposed god?  Count as 1, and remove that debt from the gods' web.<br/>When in doubt, assume the god is neutral in this challenge. <br/><br/>Count neutral gods as 5. That god is now watching the character, and the character knows it. The player should hold that card, but can discard it at any time to:<br/>-Mark that god as "amused" (indifferent towards the character).  Discard.<br/>-Change one of that god's relationships with another another god on the gods' web (add a debt to your patron, or enmity with your enemy).  Discard.<br/><br/>While you hold a god's card, they are watching you.  They have publicly shown an interest in you in front of the other gods, and you might now impress or offend them.<br/>-If you suffer Tragedy (roll a 1 / draw an Ace), or if you act against that god's interests (Oracle's call, although the player should be able to ask if an action will offend the god), mark them as "offended", and discard.<br/>-If you act in the god's interests (Oracle's call), or if you complete your quest without offending them, mark them as "pleased", and discard.<br/><br/>At the end of the quest, you may accept a gift (new power/item) from any god you have marked as "pleased".  <br/><br/>Gods' relationships with characters can be:  enemy, offended, amused, pleased, patron<br/>Gods' relationships with other gods can be:  enemy, indebted, neutral, owed, ally                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ljshepherd" title="ljshepherd"><img alt="ljshepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ljshepherd">ljshepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417882/#Comment_417882" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T15:43:46+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  3:43PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It strikes me that one could adjust play style around whether there's a single deck from which everyone draws, where one god will only observe one character at a time, or each player has their own deck so gods could take notice of multiple characters.

And perhaps allowing Oracles to decide on a style of play: one deck for everyone or one deck per player. With one deck for everyone, a god will only be observing one character at a time---but what happens when that god is the patron of another character?<br/><br/>I'm certainly in favor of simplifying goals into categories! I like the Mortal, Heroic, Legendary setup (of course, a card draw of 9 with a +3 Trait would work for Legendary too, just not for starting characters). How does this change normal roll+Trait actions? A roll of 1 is tragedy; 2-3 is failure; 4-7 is mortal success; and 8-9 (maximum possible) is heroic success?

So when you're holding a god, you hold them until the end of the quest, and either you offended them or pleased them. \n<blockquote>Having some effects based on two or more players holding the same god would be good, though, I think.</blockquote>\nI like how this adds more complication to the relationships between characters.  Maybe if two players are holding the same god (holding their attention), then you can:<br/>-Distract the god so the other player doesn't offend them.  "You keep the god of crafts' attention on you while I smash this ornate masterwork lock."<br/>-Distract the god so the other player doesn't please them.  "You saved the artisan's life?  Too bad the god of crafts was watching me instead."<br/><br/>Distracting a god who's watching you should either be difficult (takes a die roll) or costly (uses up resources, uses a turn, puts you in debt to that god, etc).  Or maybe you should just have to justify it in fiction?<br/><br/>Or maybe, at the end of the quest, if you have pleased the god, instead of marking them as "pleased" for yourself, you could:<br/>-Give another player holding the same god +1 to that relationship (up from "offended" to" amused", or "pleased" to "patron") <br/>-Give another player holding the same god -1 to that relationship (down from "pleased" to "amused", or "offended" to "enemy") \n<blockquote>-but what happens when that god is the patron of another character?</blockquote>\nSo far it just makes that relationship more important.  If we both hold the god of crafts, but he's my patron, then I really want to stay on your good side.  Although I guess it could also mean I've got more leverage to use that god against you.\n<blockquote>A roll of 1 is tragedy; 2-3 is failure; 4-7 is mortal success; and 8-9 (maximum possible) is heroic success?

Maybe the Oracle can keep unspent threat at the end of the quest, and spend it to complicate the gods' relationship web.<br/><br/>Thanks for your interest and your comments, it's helping a lot!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418274/#Comment_418274" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T11:30:34+00:00" title="July 13, 2013 11:30AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My initial thoughts:<br/><br/><i>I love, love, love this game idea.</i>  I've been pondering on a similar game in reverse (where you play the gods and the GM is the heroes), but I think yours sounds like even more fun.<br/><br/>Why have dice rolling <b>and </b>card drawing?

Enthusiastic comments like that really get me excited to put work into a game, and are what's so great about having a forum community.  I will have to take a look at Murderous Ghosts and the SkillShare workshop.\n<blockquote>Why have dice rolling <b>and </b>card drawing?  Can you simplify to just one? (Probably cards).</blockquote>\nI liked the idea of dice for regular actions and cards for powers because:<br/>1) The cards make higher numbers possible while lower numbers are also still possible (using a d6 and d10 would do this as well). <br/>2) Face cards and jokers can have different special effects that are only possible when you use your powers.<br/>3) Drawing a card would feel like a cool special reward for earning your god-given powers.   <br/><br/>But I also like simplicity in design, so suppose it was going to be just cards.  How would the normal, un-powered actions work?  Or, if normal actions and powered actions are both resolved by drawing a card, then what makes powers so special?  Some ideas:<br/>-Mortal actions succeed on a 6+, but all you can achieve is one effect.  Powered actions succeed at 5+, with extra effects (yes and ...) at 9+ and 12.  <br/>-Powers just add bonuses to Traits (+1, +2, or +3), and Legendary success is only possible at 12 or 15 (high card draw+high Trait + Power).  I'm not really excited about powers just adding bonuses, though.<br/>-Mortal success at 6+, Heroic success at 12+.  If you succeed with a power, add an extra success effect, which can include Legendary, supernatural effects not available on normal actions. <br/><br/>I think I like that last option best.  But what about drawing face cards for mortal actions?  I like the idea that this would let you draw and hold gods more often, but what effects do the gods have?<br/>-Hold the god, but draw again until you get a number.<br/>-Gods always count as 5 on mortal actions?  <br/>-Gods count as 1 / 5 / or 10, depending on your relationship with the god, and whether they approve of your action, for mortal actions, as well as for powered actions.  <br/><br/>Again I think I like the last option best, but it does make powers not very different from normal actions.  I'll just have to make the Legendary success effects really cool.\n<blockquote>I feel like with twelve gods hiding in a 52 card deck, it's very unlikely for two players to have the same god drawn at the same time.  Which is a shame because this is super cool.</blockquote>\nI agree, the players holding gods and attracting their attention / distracting them is becoming the most interesting part of the game.  How about:<br/><br/>-Keep all your numerical cards after you play them.  During another player's action, you can use cards of same suit to distract/attract gods' attention.  (This makes the suits mean something, so you'd want a pantheon with 4 separate courts or families of gods).  Maybe if you distract my god with a number card, I can keep his attention on me with a higher number card.  The cards are like your great deeds, so higher numbers are better at keeping the gods' attention.  Spending cards this way should cost you.  Maybe unspent cards can be used as xp at the end of the quest?<br/><br/>or:<br/><br/>-Players start play with their patron god as a "hole card" they can use to distract that god from another character (or maybe use for their own benefit, probably only one use per quest).  The Oracle could have an enemy god, the god this quest opposes, as a "hole card" as well.\n<blockquote>Maybe you actually need a custom deck of cards?</blockquote>\nI never thought of that!  Cool idea, and as an artist I'd love to design some special cards.  I do like the idea of a cheap game that uses what players already have at home, though.  Also, I want players to create their own pantheon of gods, not use a pantheon that I give them.\n<blockquote>I'm not sure if this will end up being playable online, but if so please keep me in mind for playtests.</blockquote>\nI definitely will!  I feel like this is turning into something that could be playtestable soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418312/#Comment_418312" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T14:26:45+00:00" title="July 14, 2013  2:26PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've played Agon, right?

The setting is similar to what I'm going for, but I'm thinking of a system for players to create their own complex pantheon of gods with a sort of Greek-myths-inspired feel, rather than focus on the specifics of Greek myth or culture.  What I want to focus on is the relationships between the gods.<br/><br/>-The gods are manipulating you as a pawn in their schemes against other gods. <br/>-Can you manipulate the gods, making their rivalries work for you?<br/>-A relationship web among the gods emerges from play.<br/>-Characters may serve more than one god, both consecutively or concurrently.<br/>-Characters may use powers from more than one god.<br/>-Some gods will approve or disapprove of your actions.<br/>-The gods' relationships affects how they influence the characters actions.<br/>-The characters' actions can influence the gods' relationships.<br/>-The characters' actions can influence other characters' relationships with the gods.  <br/><br/>I want to design a fun mechanic for these relationships, and a pretty minimal mechanic for basic physical/social interactions. <br/><br/>Thanks for the link.  It is really helpful to see what other games are doing something similar.  I'm always shocked by just how many great-looking indie games are out there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
