It also doesn't answer some of my burning questions:<br/><br/>I don't get the Teamwork pool.  How do I interpret it when someone accepts help vs. when someone refuses it?  What does it mean in the fiction to use up a bunch of teamwork dice vs just a few?  I'm having trouble mapping the ups and downs of the pool to the narration.<br/><br/>How does adding a Principal or Catch alter the conflict math?  What changes in emergent behavior should I as GM expect to see when I fiddle with the opposition like this?<br/><br/>What in-fiction objectives make good Catches, and what turns out not to make sense?<br/><br/>Can anyone point me to some good actual plays of Hollowpoint?  Bonus points if there's a podcast I can listen to.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382538/#Comment_382538" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-16T16:21:31+00:00" title="June 16, 2012  4:21PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2012 4:55PM by Brad_J_Murray.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might have more luck discussing Hollowpoint over at RPG Geek in the Hollowpoint forums. You'll find reviews and session reports linked up there as well.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpggeek.com/rpgitem/102877/hollowpoint" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpggeek.com/rpgitem/102877/hollowpoint</a><br/><br/>When you accept help, you can narrate in the advantage you gain from your compatriot. In the meantime, they stay safe, so this is a handy way as an injured agent to keep out of a risky fight and still have contributed.<br/><br/>When someone refuses help, you are bulling ahead with your plan at the cost of team resources. You could narrate that as blazing away the ammunition supply, using the last grenade, sacrificing an informant, or just shouldering everyone out of your way so you can be awesome all by yourself. Taking a lot of teamwork dice is usually a bad move -- not only does it chew up valuable resources, but it also increases the chance that you will succeed briefly and too quickly (by getting a single wide set). I would choose the narration based on the result rather than on the taking of the dice -- it might go well for you or it might be hilariously wrong, but you won't know until the dice hit the table.<br/><br/>A principal increases the number of sets the ref can get provided there's a large enough dice pool to work with (which is why it's best to bring a principal in later in the game). With 12 or more dice you should be inflicting 1.5 x more effects (very roughly) with a principal splitting the pool.<br/><br/>A catch forces the team to split their efforts between two distinct narrative threads. Depending on the number of dice in the catch, this can have a limited or a devastating effect. When the dice hit the table, you'll know how hard or easy this will be.<br/><br/>Good catches are things you wouldn't want to frame a whole conflict around but that are genre-appropriate problems to solve in the middle of one. Defusing bombs, cracking safes, hacking government databases ... anything that takes some time, is outside the action, and has a clear effect for success or failure.<br/><br/>Edit: adding that there's a lot of Hollowpoint activity on Google+ -- I'm there as Brad Murray and I can steer you into the other Hollowpointers easily enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joey" title="Joey"><img alt="Joey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joey">Joey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382541/#Comment_382541" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-16T17:02:44+00:00" title="June 16, 2012  5:02PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, thanks.

That's a bit of a stinging critique of the text, but it's very hard to pin down the probabilities in the system. When you play you'll see where you connect with the design and it's *very* easy but it's not a traditional guy-vs-guy simulation in any sense, so it can be slippery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
