I'm using a modified version of Amber Diceless incorporating some "story driving" elements.  A rough version of this is detailed over at my livejournal  <a href="http://johnpaul613.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://johnpaul613.livejournal.com/</a> .  I've since simplified these rules so don't get lost.  What I'm working on now is a modification to the GM/player set up.  There are three of us playing.  I want each us to be "the prisoner" for a scene.  We will each play the following roles on rotating basis:<br/><br/>1.  Play the "Prisoner" in this game this will alway be Corwin (although the players do not have to play this up).  This person will determine the location/setting. <br/>2.  Play the "Antagonist" (ie Number 2) in this game it could be any other book character.  This person will also introduce and play other minor NPC's<br/>3.  Play the "GM" Set up conflict, introduce and play other book NPC's, adjudicate conflict.<br/><br/>Is this a good division?  I want the Prisoner vs Antagonist roles to be at the center with the GM role keeping things honest.  I also considered a Polaris like division but not having played this yet I'm not sure I'm comfortable with how it works.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to have a way to decide who really is Corwin.  My thought was that some (or all of us) may just be shadows of the real Corwin locked in Shadow Earth while he was without his memory.  This would allow a wide range of behavior, abilities, and end games.  I thought about some kind of "owe list" like IAWA but I just got the PDF and I haven't run it real time.  Also, since I will be giving out Good Stuff (in this modificaiton its a FATE like currency but more powerful) with this system maybe the person who ends with the highest Good Stuff total should be Corwin.  <br/><br/>Could anyone help me think this through?  <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Scott                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120110/#Comment_120110" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T07:51:20+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  7:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Scott,<br/><br/>I'm waiting on my copy of The Prisoner, of which I've heard only good things.

Here are some ideas:<br/><br/>The ongoing threat in the series is to the title character's individuality.  Every episode, there is a new Number 2, because the previous Number 2 failed to break Number 6, and make him conform.  Rotate the Number 2 role, but leave the Prisoner one player, more and more abused.  <br/><br/>Every Number 2 used mind games, lies, surreal events, sometimes even drugs to get Number 6 to conform, and to give up the information:  "Why did you resign?"  Mess with the Prisoner's perception of the game itself.  Use Amber Diceless -- but make the Prisoner roll dice to do things, or sometimes play cards, or maybe Jenga.  Don't make that stuff <b>completely</b> meaningless, though, or he'll see through it.  Lie to him about the ground rules.  Make him uncertain.  Give him a Secret at the beginning, that he cannot tell lest he lose the game.  Then tell him that there is no winning and losing, it's an RPG after all.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In the series, Number 6 never knew who to trust.  Have another player in the game, or several.  Make the Prisoner unsure as to whether the other person is another player, or a GM/Antagonist.  Kill them off, then bring them back as if nothing happened.  Have them betray his trust, then not seem to remember doing it.  <br/><br/>In one episode, Number 6 was 'elected' to be the new Number 2.  It was a scam, of course, just designed to trick him into talking.  Do the same thing.  Let the Prisoner <i>believe</i> that he has become the GM.  The tricks he tries to pull on the 'real' GM as a player-prisoner may reveal the Secret.  <br/><br/>Do <i>anything</i> in order to get the Secret.  Pretend that the game is over, and ask for 'player feedback'.  Have someone else come up, and ask about how the game ran, and what the big Secret was anyway...  If he won't tell, even then, he's catching on...<br/><br/>OK, this now looks a lot more like psychological torture than like an RPG, but I think it would model the series fairly well.  It's <i>about</i> psychological torture, after all.  Remember the opening narration:<br/><br/>    "Where am I?"<br/>    "In the Village."<br/>    "What do you want?"<br/>    "Information."<br/>    "Whose side are you on?"<br/>    "That would be telling\u2026. We want information. Information! INFORMATION!"<br/>    "You won't get it."<br/>    "By hook or by crook, we will."<br/>    "Who are you?"<br/>    "The new Number Two." <br/>    "Who is Number One?"<br/>    "<i>You</i> are Number Six." <br/>    "I am not a number \u2014 I am a free man!"<br/>    Number Two just laughs.<br/><br/>Good luck.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
