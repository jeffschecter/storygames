Even if it wasn't, you question isn't specific enough. Larps are at least as varied as tabletop gaming, probably even more so, and without more information, this question is impossible to answer.<br/><br/>That said, IME there are many reasons to go on a Larp, some of which might be split up and examined in the way GNS does it with at-the-table roleplaying. Maybe somebody has even done so already, dunno.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104903/#Comment_104903" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T17:15:26+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  5:15PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, GNS makes a lot of sense to me with LARPs, even though that's not what it's designed for. <br/><br/>You can play many LARPs to win (e.g. to discover the murderer) and play them in a Sim way ("I just want to play my character"). As with tabletop games, the two can conflict badly if different groups wants different things. <br/><br/>In a jury game, winning would probably consist of swaying the jury your way. So, you'll get a lot of conflict if some players play to win (sway the jury their way), while others just want to play their character. Usually, the ones who want to play their character will accuse the ones who want to play to win of powergaming.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104940/#Comment_104940" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T01:58:52+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  1:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>are we going to be there to try to win?<br/><br/>or to try to build a story together?<br/><br/>or to try to dream the dream?</blockquote>\nIf you don't know this by now, then the organizers have failed somewhat in their preparations. Or maybe they will tell you on the day of play. The problem that you have in tabletop with people expecting totally different things is only a larger problem in larp. The degree of freedom in larp is greater and so is (usually) the amount of people.<br/><br/>But, on the other hand, in a larp the culture and habits of the other players is forced upon you in a much more forceful way than in tabletop. People who play together will quite easily develop a common style and agreements. My personal experience is definitely that the people that are most easy to larp with are those who have never larped anything before and who has never played tabletop! When I started larping I had spent my whole life throwing dice. I had to unlearn everything! Those new people you can mold in a day. (And they will never be the same again...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104945/#Comment_104945" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T03:29:21+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  3:29AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thanks for the answers guys<br/><br/>I'll talk to the organizer before we start to find out what the focus is here                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105488/#Comment_105488" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T02:49:27+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  2:49AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            alright, a little feedback <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/>so we all had objectives, in game<br/><br/>my character was an FBI agent, trying to catch a russian agent (setting was "cold war")<br/><br/>other characters had other objectives<br/><br/>by the end of the game, some had accomplished their goals, and some hadn't<br/><br/>those who had were congratulated<br/><br/>feels like Gam to me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/>next: the whole game had a definite Sim vibe<br/><br/>the players would talk for the sake of acting, we were all dressed up, etc.<br/><br/>and I talked to the organizer after the game, asking my GNS question, and his answers were definitely along the lines of "making some kind of imaginary reality come to life together"<br/><br/><br/>then, some of the players gave me a ride home<br/><br/>I said I thought the game had tons of different intrigues, and that it would have worked just as well, if not better, with less stuff<br/><br/>to which one of the gamers tells me this is done on purpose, so the players can latch on to those intrigues they like best, and take the story in the direction they want<br/><br/>so, Nar?

In my experience (for what it's worth) most of live gaming, apart from reenactement and some nordic european movement (jeepform, for example), is Gam (taking the basic structure of the "challenge" from Murder Parties - investigation - or from fighting games like soft air or boffer larps)<br/><br/>This is not "supported" by the Big Model by the way.  The BM is definite only on tabletop playing, any extension to larps is done by extrapolation. That above is my extrapolation... ;-)\n<blockquote><br/>next: the whole game had a definite Sim vibe<br/><br/>the players would talk for the sake of acting, we were all dressed up, etc.<br/><br/>and I talked to the organizer after the game, asking my GNS question, and his answers were definitely along the lines of "making some kind of imaginary reality come to life together"<br/></blockquote>\nThis seems like baseline Exploration to me. It's what differentiate between a gamist Larp and a game of Chess: the stuff of role-playing.  It does not define a game as "sim" until it become more important than all the rest.<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>then, some of the players gave me a ride home<br/><br/>I said I thought the game had tons of different intrigues, and that it would have worked just as well, if not better, with less stuff<br/><br/>to which one of the gamers tells me this is done on purpose, so the players can latch on to those intrigues they like best, and take the story in the direction they want<br/><br/>so, Nar?</blockquote>\nNo, even in D&amp;D you usually can choose between attacking the door to le left or the door to the right...  :-)<br/><br/>It would be Nar if the players could (or even be expected to) express what they think about the subject going against the objective of their characters. And anyway, it's really doubtful that we can use the word "narrativism" for games where you don't have a single storyline and the story of each character is almost indipendent from the other  (as I said above, The Big Model asumes that the game is tabletop)<br/><br/>But, apart of this GNS stuff, what did you think of the game? What differences you saw with your usual way of playing? Do you want to larp again? The is something you would have liked more if done in a different way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105629/#Comment_105629" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T03:56:45+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  3:56AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite><br/>so we all had objectives, in game<br/><br/>my character was an FBI agent, trying to catch a russian agent (setting was "cold war")</blockquote>\nThis was the objective of your character, but it was understood that you could play him causing him to fail, or you could change your mind and defect, or leave the FBI... or it was understood that you had to play to try to get the spy to avoid "ruining" the game to others?<br/>I think I was expected to at least try to fulfill my objective at the start, to get the ball rolling in the "right direction"<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the idea was for me to be really cut-throat about it<br/><br/>I don't think so, judging from the generally relaxed atmosphere<br/><br/>now, I think it might have been OK for me to change my character's goals halfway through<br/><br/>for instance, my character sheet said I found another character very attractive, and she turned out to be a russian agent, so I guess I could have decided to defect at some point<br/><br/>the second half of the game was very chaotic anyway, so I think anything would have been OK <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>But, apart of this GNS stuff, what did you think of the game?
