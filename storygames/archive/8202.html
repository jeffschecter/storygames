That's been a hell of a lot of fun to play.<br/>Lots of solid gaming discussion here that has been thoughtful, respectful and kick-ass. Only one banning this last year, too, IIRC.<br/>GenCon was awesome: It also taught me that I'm thankful for more local conventions, which are far more my speed lately.<br/>Making new friends in gaming-land.<br/>Nerdly this year was a lot of fun as well. I played in a number of games, rather than worrying about organization and stuff. The trip there was a blast, too, stopping in historic Richmond for lunch at an old lunchbox factory.<br/>Finding and buying awesome graph and storyboard paper at Levenger, which really helped me organize my sessions and scenarios over the following months (also use it to record my 4e characters).<br/><br/>Specific to RPGs<br/>Being able to put together and release Maid RPG, as a "toe in the water" into the cottage industry, cut my teeth, etc.<br/>The release of Hellas<br/>D&amp;D 4E: Honestly, my honeymoon with it is just about over. But it still stands as "the game that makes combat in all my other RPGs feel mealy-mouthed and empty", and has put my brain spinning in several new directions in terms of gaming.<br/>The release of a new complete version of Barbarians of Lemuria<br/>The release of In a Wicked Age (which admittedly, I played more before it came out than after; need to hit it sometime this holiday season).<br/><br/>Specific to Other Gaming/video games:<br/>Valkyria Chronicles: Changed how I view strategic RPGs/games<br/>Dead Space<br/>Left4Dead<br/>SIREN: New Translation/Blood Curse. Horror gaming is still awesome.<br/><br/>What are you thankful for this year?<br/><br/>Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forvrin" title="forvrin"><img alt="forvrin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forvrin">forvrin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180506/#Comment_180506" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T14:34:48+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  2:34PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Houses of the Blooded.<br/>\n<br/>\nTemple of Elemental Evil using Fate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Third Book of Avatar.  -- Avatar the Last Airbender has been the fuel for more games than any other property, except for<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Middleman -- which is where I (steal) get the rest of my inspirations from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180510/#Comment_180510" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T14:50:20+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  2:50PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A Godlike campaign that is a jump-booted kick in the guts every time we play. I've done military/war themed RPGs before but this one has nailed the Band of Brother feel like nothing else I've done.<br/><br/>A year of running monthly oneshots of all kinds of different games at the FLGS.

My other attempts to game before GenCon were sporadic and painful attempts to keep a D&amp;D game going.

Most of all, though, I really felt my fading connection to the place renew and change in good ways.<br/><br/>An actual (semi-)regular indie-gaming night with Matt, Christian, and David (with a great guest appearance by Jesse!). "No Man's Land", Shakham, the Clatterer, Sorcerer, all of it.

Both the ones with me and the ones before me.<br/><br/>My friends. One couldn't find a more loyal bunch.<br/><br/>With all the shaky things that have happened in the past year, things could have gotten a lot worse.<br/><br/>My love of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei being helpful to my work. (And thanks Atlus for releasing Persona 4!)<br/><br/>Making new friends at Gencon and Kubla. You know who you are.<br/><br/>All the great memories and stories I have around the gaming table. No matter where people go, I'll look over each big moment fondly.<br/><br/>Assisting Adventure Planning Service with editing their quickstart english rules at Gencon. It was well worth sacrificing a game session at the show as it aided me in getting my current job.<br/><br/>D&amp;D - our group's campaign been going incredibly well, mostly in part to giving another character type a try: A shy, meek and timid Ice Wizard girl with pyrophobia. Certainly a change from badass and loud jerks with emotional baggage and now absolutely hilarious when teaming up with Ewen's dragonborn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>
