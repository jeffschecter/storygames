Who will win, what's the risk here etc etc. Dialog with people who already are giving the PCs what they want tend to be handwaved while if there's a petition we zoom way in. We had a fight against a dozen zombies that the players set it up so that they couldn't lose, basically. So I wrapped the fight up early because there was nothing to resolve. <br/>. . . <br/>[in contrast:] "Wait, how exactly are your tents set up?" (Because I need to know in order for the game to proceed, because something's coming in the night.)</p></div></blockquote>When I GM, I <i>can be</i> aware of pacing concerns.  I <i>sometimes</i> remember to fast-forward through periods of no uncertainty.<br/><br/>But sometimes I get caught up in the fictional moment and just forget.  I'm thankful when the players use the <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">pacing dial</a> (or just their words) to remind me.<br/><br/>I'd say the most difficult case for me is the one of uncertain uncertainty.  The unknown unknowns.  Here's an example:<br/><br/>The PCs arrive at a new city.  There's a main road in, and a wooden wall, and guards, and a small tax to pay to enter.  <br/><br/>A friend of mine ran a session where the process of meeting the guards took up a big portion of the evening.  I asked him why he didn't just ask the players to cross the tax cash off their sheets, and then describe their entry into the city.  He said that, although that was the most <i>likely</i> outcome, he couldn't predict what the PCs might do that might be relevant.  Although he didn't have specific obstacles or opportunities in mind, player choices can always create those!<br/><br/>I can't say he was incorrect about that.  I've seen players do all of the following in similar situations:\n<ul><li>Roleplay a little conversation, take a liking to the guards, and then take some steps towards establishing them as allies or resources going forward (e.g. with promises or bribes).</li><li>Roleplay a little conversation, form a distaste for the guards, and then provoke them into some sort of confrontation which results in denial of entry, threats, bad blood, or even a fight.</li><li>Ask a lot questions, and in the ensuing player-GM back-and-forth, everyone inspires each other, and before you know it there are all sorts of new fun options to explore that didn't exist a moment ago.  (Often current problems, opportunities and mysteries in the city.)</li></ul>\nIf I recall correctly, none of that actually happened in my friend's session, but most of it seemed like it might.  There was some friendliness and some friction and a few questions that might have had really interesting answers but ultimately didn't.  <br/><br/>I think the players did come away with a better understanding of the structure of the city guard organization.  If this group was like my group, one or two players probably felt like they'd acquired a valuable resource (just kinda seems like useful knowledge) while everyone else probably felt like they'd wasted their time (what exactly are we gonna <i>do</i> with this knowledge?).<br/><br/>Anyway, my conclusion is that it's a shame to spend lots of play time on an irrelevant encounter, but it's also a shame to never let a seemingly irrelevant encounter develop into something more.  So I think some sort of in between would be ideal.  Any thoughts on that?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473708/#Comment_473708" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T15:00:55+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  3:00PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A fascinating and complex topic.

Such as, are you actually, on some level, telling the players that this toll booth is a lever? Do you have players who pull every lever? Is it because that's what they want or because they think they're being asked to pull these levers?<br/><br/>HOWEVER. I think you can largely cut through all of that by directly asking the players what they want. Some capital I Immersion folks bristle at that, and that's okay, you just probably have to navigate your specific table culture. But if you're cool with asking, it's so damn effective. I don't think it remotely interferes with any kind of sandbox play, either, but your mileage may vary.<br/>As soon as you recognize that the interaction has gone beyond the basics or a certain length of time, directly ask, "What do you want out of this scene/this conversation/this character?" And what's really cool is that the players can say, "I'll know it when I see it," effectively telling you that they want more of this pace, more of this level of probing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473722/#Comment_473722" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T16:57:00+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  4:57PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" rel="nofollow">Paul_D_L</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The choice to describe the city with the wooden wall, guards, and small cover charge is, itself, declaring a pace.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe point is that we're using rules where we "have" to zoom in there in order to find out what happens                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473724/#Comment_473724" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T17:08:52+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  5:08PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" rel="nofollow">Paul_D_L</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The choice to describe the city with the wooden wall, guards, and small cover charge is, itself, declaring a pace.</p></div></blockquote>\nThe point is that we're using rules where we "have" to zoom in there in order to find out what happens</div></blockquote>\nDo you mean practices or systemic rules?

You don't want them, well then you know that these house rules might cause them and you might need to find a way to mitigate that.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" rel="nofollow">Paul_D_L</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>perhaps create a protocol for <i>exactly</i> what pace/number of details are established depending on the nature of the petition</p></div></blockquote>\nWe have that.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473734/#Comment_473734" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T18:45:46+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  6:45PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 10, 2018 6:48PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" rel="nofollow">Paul_D_L</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The choice to describe the city with the wooden wall, guards, and small cover charge is, itself, declaring a pace.</p></div></blockquote>True.

You don't have to be bored to recognize, "This game would be better if..." <i>and then make that happen</i>.<br/><br/>I guess the question is whether you're 1. seeking specific advice on how to play your house rules, 2. seeking pointers on general best practices as a way to guide your house rules, 3. seeking pointers on general best practices <i>period</i>, or 4. trying to fix potential dysfunction that might be causing that disappointment.<br/><br/>One "best practices" thing is that you recognize the game could be better, but don't know <i>how</i> it could be better. This is a fascinating issue and can be addressed through anything from studying narrative storytelling to studying video game level design. But it most reliably seems to improve in the presence of players who have a strong feel for what they want. And perhaps even more in the presence of players who have a vested interest in pursuing/featuring what <i>other players want</i>.<br/>The pacing dial seems like it could be a way to brute force that. You don't necessarily arrive at something better, but at least things change and there might be opportunities to snag on something you didn't know would be better until you saw it. Then again, maybe that means you never examine or address why the pace change was apparently necessary.<br/><br/>Another issue is that you do recognize how things could be better, but your game or table culture complicates your ability to get there. If one person is disappointed, okay, let's fix that next session. If multiple people are disappointed, especially if it happens repeatedly (even if not regularly), I'd change something substantial. Whether it's some kind of perceived expectation within the group, fixing a rigid house rule, using an entirely different system, or whatever; there's something there that elevates from seeking pointers on best practices to fixing dysfunction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473770">\n<div

Or, rather, mutually exclusive or that one is in some way detrimental to the other.<br/><br/>If a seemingly irrelevant encounter can develop into a relevant one, then the assumption is that it's not automatically <i>relevant because it is happening at all</i>. So, if it eventually becomes relevant because the players keep probing, then it seems like it's because the players obviously want it to become relevant and it takes that long to gather enough fictional momentum to sustain relevance, or because the GM finally improvises something that is relevant to the players.<br/>I think in order for the encounter to last that long, it seems like the GM either cannot detect what's important to the players or sees their own role as one in which they must be completely impartial about what the players want except to react in a completely micro sense.<br/><br/>I think I've played games in which those types of fun both happen freely, but maybe those two types of fun are competing with the added ingredient of that GM or GM mode. I'll have to think about it more, but that might be a good place to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473840/#Comment_473840" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-12T05:34:15+00:00" title="May 12, 2018  5:34AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really interesting discussion, and I'm really enjoying your contributions here, Paul_D_L.

That'd solve all the problems you've mentioned."<br/><br/>It's true.  It would solve everything.  But it would create a different sort of problem.<br/><br/>In my experience, all of the pacing issues I encounter arise from getting lost in the fiction, in the imagined moment.<br/><br/>At the same time, in those games, the majority of the <i>enjoyment</i> I get from play arises from exactly the same thing: getting lost in the fiction, in the imagined moment.<br/><br/>So, "remember that you're playing a game and that you have game duties to attend to" at once fixes my pacing and punches a huge hole in my enjoyment.<br/><br/>The pacing dial only works because it's only employed after someone's <i>already</i> slipped out of being lost in the imagined moment (because the imagined moment isn't sufficiently captivating).  If the dial were being used <i>constantly</i>, I'd <i>hate</i> it.<br/><br/>So that's my starting point.  <br/><br/>That's why I didn't jump at <a href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">@DInDenver</a> 's approach and why I'm not sure what to do with <a href="/forums/profile/DeReel">@DeReel</a> 's very cool take.<br/><br/>At the same time, I'm <i>not</i> insisting on "never think in game terms except when you have to" either!  If that were my perspective, I'd simply accept some long and pointless conversations with guards as the cost of doing business (which is exactly what my friend does, the one who GMed that conversation).<br/><br/>I think my ideal is to have a <b>procedure to call on</b>, which meets all of the following criteria:<br/>- is quick to employ<br/>- is invoked intuitively in the regular course of narration and play (i.e. is easy to remember)<br/>- improves pacing per the group's preferences at that time<br/><br/>I can take a break from being lost in the fictional moment as long as it is a quick and useful break and I don't forget.<br/><br/>Here's an example that doesn't work yet but might illustrate a useful direction:\n<blockquote>Whenever you roll, pick a time scale: Action, Encounter, or Extended.  If Action, the roll resolves whether your statement charms the guard.  If Encounter, the roll resolves whether you make the guards into allies.  If Extended, the roll resolves how the whole "interact with guards" thing turns out for you in the end, e.g. "It takes you weeks to get into the city," or, "After you've been in the city for weeks, the guards want to hire you for this mission that's vital to them."</blockquote>\nSo, instead of interrupting a conversation about travel and city walls and guards and taxes or whatnot, we have a procedure that's baked into the player characters attempting to do something in the fiction. <br/><br/>Again, this example doesn't work.  It doesn't work because, in the style of play I'm pursuing here, I don't use die rolls for stuff like "Did your last statement charm the guard?"  But maybe it'll kick off some new inspirations...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474024/#Comment_474024" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T20:02:58+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  8:02PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2018 8:04PM by Paul_T.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Dave. It's some excellent into how you play, as well, which is handy.<br/><br/>(Dave and I are currently play a game of <i>Sorcerer</i> together, with him as the GM.)<br/><br/>In our game, I've been somewhat consciously trying to speak up here and there, to fast forward or zoom in on different bits of the story. It's a bit funny to do as a player, especially when the fiction is intriguing, but it's been fun to try and you've been very accommodating, which means it's not socially awkward and doesn't hurt the game.<br/><br/>We don't have a specific tool or a technique, but I just occasionally speak up and say, "Hey, unless you've got some cool thing here, how about we just summarize and skip ahead to when we get to the Place?" It's been a fun experiment (and we've only been doing it a little while, so I wouldn't jump to too weighty a conclusion just yet).<br/><br/>I'd love to hear what that experience has been like from your end. Jarring? Difficult? Or is it freeing, because you don't have to worry about pacing anymore?

I have no need for it because I don't want the pacing to have any mechanical influence. I just want the information.<br/><br/>Smart players can find it on the spot. It's like acting and storytelling at the same time : you want to focus on two objects, one close up, one far away. Making use of their brain zones in an innovative way is the challenge and the reward for some players. <br/><br/>A player, like the GM, can be in charge of that. For my game, I plan on offering one player to act as a "dramatic sismographer" and rank each conflict on a time scale (slomo, scene, sequence, summary).<br/><br/>I sidestep the topic a bit, with a tip from board game design : use your players time off. From what you say, Dave, for you downtime is before a roll : check stats, add modifiers, negotiate margins (building tension before action maybe ?). In my game the end of a conflict is that time where we do a bit of scribbling : remove traits, add XP. Adding "scale conflict" keeps it light.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474045/#Comment_474045" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-18T10:37:25+00:00" title="May 18, 2018 10:37AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2018 10:39AM by Paul_D_L.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is obviously going to vary by system, but in a system that has room for it, what about defaulting to players' describing what their characters' intentions are whenever they do something?<br/><br/>That way, <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>, the GM who is lost in the fiction never has to get "found" again - the players are always declaring the level of zoom they want. And doing so not just in an unobtrusive way, but in a way that continually reinforces the fiction AND possibly reminds the players of what their purpose is and what levers their characters might reasonably pull.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that intentions vary like your action/encounter/extended time scales, but they do it organically.<br/>"I tell the guards I appreciate their service. It's probably a thankless job and I want an opening to talk to them casually so I can learn about this place."<br/>"I look for someone who appears a bit poor for the toll and offer to pay for them in clear sight of the guards. I want to make a good impression."<br/>"Can I find out anything useful from the guards?"<br/><br/>I think some game masters automatically resist that last level of focus by demanding that players explain how they interact with the guards in detail. But the point is that the players are outright telling you they don't care about that. Or, at the very least, they're picking up clues from your narration that the guards only matter that much. You only have to worry about <i>correcting</i> the game's zoom when the zoom you've chosen conflicts with what the players want. And it's difficult to do that when the players effectively tell you what that is (it seems like it's just a matter of achieving that without disrupting the flow).<br/><br/>That's not to say you can't ever ask for more detail, but <i>that</i> might be the time to use the pacing dial. Whenever you find yourself asking someone to move from the bigger picture to the smaller picture, hand them the dial marker. They can always choose to remain zoomed out, but with the understanding that they're giving up the reigns in a way.<br/>"Can I find out anything useful from the guards?"<br/>"Maybe, how do you want to go about it?" <b>Hand over the dial marker.</b><br/><b>Player places the marker on scene summary, indicating a desire not to dig in.</b> "I just ask some basic questions and see if anything stands out. I don't want to slow the line at the booth or annoy them."<br/>And if there's really something there that you like, you can immediately offer a chance to zoom in again: "Something <i>does</i> stand out to you. One of the guards is older than you'd expect and the other is very green. The older one is focused on training the younger guard, so if you only ask basic questions, you'll only get basic answers." <b>Hand over the dial marker.</b><br/>Et cetera.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474047/#Comment_474047" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-18T13:56:22+00:00" title="May 18, 2018  1:56PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2018 1:59PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, dude, that is a really good idea!<br/><br/>I think with some personalities at the table it'll be easier than with others.

The "moves" operate slightly differently at different scales, in other words. The Scene Summary Action moves the game along faster for everyone involved, whereas the Immediate Action allows you to build momentum for a followup action in the immediate scene.<br/><br/>The implementation would be tricky, but, for some games, it could work really nicely.

In Masks, the game specifically encourages the GM and players to talk about it in terms of a comic book: describing the splash page that introduces the team, describing your character's reaction like "the next panel shows Bell with tears running down her face".  This kind of thing is really fun, especially if you've got more than a few comics/film nerds in your group.  <br/><br/>It's probably no accident that both of these games foster an Actor or Pawn stance.

It always felt right in the moment; there were rarely any glitches of, like, "Oh god, why are we playing this out and why can't we stop?!?!"<br/><br/>At the same time, there were plenty of end-of-session regrets.  "We only get 3 hrs a month to advance this adventure; I wish we'd gotten farther."<br/><br/>Thus, the need for play tools that interrupt the usual, instinctive flow.<br/><br/>At the same time, a pattern of interruption would be extremely unwelcome.  The pacing dial exists primarily to inform, promise and remind each player that <i>they have the right and responsibility</i> to speed up or slow down as desired.  Those rights and responsibilities are only exercised when necessary, which is <i>not</i> frequent, but does make a big difference when it comes up.  I think it's worth noting that, with a long-running group, the dial is effectively a training tool -- once the group has internalized a sense of pacing options, no one needs the dial anymore (I don't think I even bothered to put it out on the table in my home game).<br/><br/>Having had some success with that approach, I do think the <i>awareness</i> behind pacing decisions could still be improved, though, and that that would yield even <i>better</i> results.  That's why I like the "state intents during shifts (or potential shifts) in pacing" idea.  We're less likely to give an encounter more or less time than it deserves if we're in the <i>habit</i> of considering <i>why</i> we're playing it.  My hope is that, just like with the pacing dial, any formal process could be useful as training and then be abandoned with experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474112/#Comment_474112" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-21T20:39:31+00:00" title="May 21, 2018  8:39PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For most of my play history, I've zoomed in and out organically.

The pacing dial exists primarily to inform, promise and remind each player that <i>they have the right and responsibility</i> to speed up or slow down as desired.  Those rights and responsibilities are only exercised when necessary, which is <i>not</i> frequent, but does make a big difference when it comes up.  I think it's worth noting that, with a long-running group, the dial is effectively a training tool -- once the group has internalized a sense of pacing options, no one needs the dial anymore (I don't think I even bothered to put it out on the table in my home game).<br/><br/>Having had some success with that approach, I do think the <i>awareness</i> behind pacing decisions could still be improved, though, and that that would yield even <i>better</i> results.

Often the only schedule adults can manage, seems like it will work, but rarely results in the engagement anybody wants or expects.<br/><br/>Maybe this is a weird question, but are these fairly inexperienced gamers? Have any of them ever GMed? Have they played a game with different fundamental zoom procedures? Example: Burning Wheel, in which 1. importance/relevance of scenes are determined by Beliefs and 2. player intent is necessarily announced when performing tasks.<br/><br/>I ask that because it occurs to me that if this funnels back to regrets and player-training, it's possible that the biggest issues and solutions are social and/or fully systemic (as opposed to welding a single rule into your existing game). I dunno. This is that weird part of gaming that can be unsolvable because the only way to overcome a larger, long term issue is with changes that are significant enough to choke and kill a current campaign. And that, itself, will cause a new, larger, long term issue within the group, and so forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474114/#Comment_474114" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-21T20:43:59+00:00" title="May 21, 2018  8:43PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2018 8:46PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I wind up GMing this style of game, it is mostly for inexperienced players or players who'd only ever played D&amp;D &amp; similar RPGs.<br/><br/>Supposing I were to sell an RPG product which employed the techniques we've been discussing, "D&amp;D players" would probably be my target audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
