True D20 systems (D&amp;D 3rd, etc) work well with that system focused on just the D20. Shadowrun works great as a D6 dice pool system. Battletech worked well as a 2D6 system. Rolemaster works well as D% systems. Top Secret:SI works amazingly as a modified D% system.<br/><br/>Point being the systems utilized are as integral to those experiences as the back story or any mechanical elements. Change the system and you've changed the game.<br/><br/>So figure out what it is the dice are trying to accomplish, and decide which dice (or alternate system) supports that goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434297/#Comment_434297" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T14:24:36+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  2:24PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think about it like this:  every cognitive task in the die resolution process should support the game.<br/><br/>let's look at Dungeons and Dragons:  the creators could have had you roll a d20 to generate your ability scores.  It's less complicated than rolling three different dice and adding them together.  But unlike the single die roll, the 3d6 creates a probability curve that clusters results around the mean, approximating a bell curve.  This adds to the game.  When the game was being revised in 2000, the designers realized that players wanted characters to be specifically above average, and created an even more complicated mechanic of rolling 4d6 and dropping the lowest.  This gave PCs higher abilities, but it also preserved the idea of the 3d6 system used in previous editions, creating the impression that the characters were above some theoretical average baseline.<br/><br/>Resolution in games like Dogs in the Vineyard and Cortex Plus is much more complicated.  Players assemble pools of variously sized dice, roll them, and choose specific dice from the rolled pool to add into their total.  But the complexity benefits the game because it allows a characters action to represent various character traits in a single dice pool, and also provides an element of strategic choice.<br/><br/>d100 is more complicated than d20, in that it requires us to assemble the result from a roll of multiple dice (assuming one doesn't use an expensive and impractical novelty die), but unlike the examples above, it doesn't provide a more interesting probability curve, it doesn't allow multiple means of character expression in a resolution roll, and it doesn't provide additional strategic complexity.  The only benefit of a d100 is granularity--and that level of granularity is a turn-off to lots of players, especially here on story games where it might be interpreted as a signal that you're focusing your design efforts on pointless finicky details instead of on the core aspects of your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus" title="Ursus_Spelaeus"><img alt="Ursus_Spelaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus">Ursus_Spelaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434298/#Comment_434298" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-24T15:19:05+00:00" title="June 24, 2014  3:19PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I disagree with arscott's point above that d100 doesn't allow multiple means of character expression.
