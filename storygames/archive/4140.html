Ian Noble facilitated the <i>Grey Ranks </i>games, and his delivery of the background material (the true story of the teen-age partisans in Poland trying to defeat the Nazis in WWII) really set an amazing tone that produced a really moving session.  (I think, however, from what I heard, the next night's session was even <i>cooler</i>!)<br/><br/>The <i>Shock</i> game Judson Lester ran was a blast.  I suspect he tweaked the rules a little, but all I can say is, although we didn't get to finish the story, the SciFi world we were building on the fly was becoming incredibly detailed and rich.  I mean, we were making up a hard SF story on the fly.  And all the SF elements were impacting the characters on a personal and plot level that sort of astounded me.  We had humor and pathos and a real mess brewing.  I loved it.<br/><br/>(From what I understand, we were more tightly focused on the improv elements than previous runs of the game. We had 5 players, 4 social issues and 2 SF Shocks.  I think that by limiting the focus, the players were able to more easily stay FOCUSED and produced tighter results that went deeper with each scene.)<br/><br/><br/>I loved my players in the <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game.  Each of them had read it, but had never played before.  The got completely into adding color and detail for the bonus dice.  Scenes were growing tense and you could just see how the drama and stakes were going to be growing for each one of them.  I had limited the attendance to 3 players and had to turn people away.  But I'm glad I did this.  It really let me focus appropriate attention on each player and let them, I think, dig into to the game, "get" how their input would be rewarded.  My reaction was: <i>This was like a perfect first session for a gaming group, we rock, and I can't wait to see where this goes over the next 5 or 8 sessions.</i><br/><br/><br/>I loved the <i>Sci-Run</i> game Tom ran on the fly.  Loved it.  I can't speak to the mechanics: It's still an Ash-can, Tom had read the rules but ran it two minutes after I said, "Hey, can you run something?" and apparently it shares details with other games that I don't know.<br/><br/>I <i>do</i> know that we played a group of four people who wake up in these SF containers that washed up on the shore in Long Beach during a horrible storm.  We have no memories, but we have special powers.  The way the game works is that your character sheet is: "What do I see when I look in a mirror?" and four questions.  The questions are like: "Why can I read other people's thoughts?" or "Why am I afraid of the color yellow?"<br/><br/>The framework of the story is that there are agents of a shadow organization after us.  As we run, we roll dice and distribute them on a chart.  The charts has boxes for "Escape" "Getting Hurt" "Memory" (or labels like that.) So you can choose to put better rolls in one box or another.  If you put a good value in memory, the group helps you answer one of the questions on your character sheet.  So, you're basically creating flashbacks that fill in the blanks for your character, the reason you have the powers, the agents that are after you.  But, of course, you're also trying not to get killed or captured or have your sci powers that your slowly figuring out get out of control, so you never quite get what you want, and have to decide what you want most scene by scene.  It was blast making up the answers to the questions.<br/><br/>[continued]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92852/#Comment_92852" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T20:52:12+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  8:52PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2007 8:59PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued part 2]<br/><br/>The first PtA game I ran was called <i>"Cult of Personality"</i> and was set in the compound of cult ruled by a woman who was the wife of the nominal cult leader.  We established less of a TV series and more of a Showtime miniseries.  It was CRAZY -- crazy, crazy fun.  Everyone there had motives at different cross-purposes.  One character who had all the right reasons to destroy the cult was using horrible cult brainwashing techniques to destroy the cult from the inside, another who only wanted respect was doing one horrible thing after another to get some love.  It was a Jacobian blood bath, and as we closed on the last shot, one brain washed character was on his way to kill the cult's lawyer on behalf of the cult leader's wife, while a rogue cultist had brainwashed a completely screwed up kid and sent him to kill the wife herself.<br/><br/><br/>The second PtA session ended up being called <i>"Last Rites." </i> It was built around a kind of detective show, but set in an alternate time period.  We started thinking about WW II england, then kicked around ancient rome, then thought about two detectives in a D&amp;D fantasy world, and then settled on Oxford in the middle ages.  (Let's be clear... The history part was just color -- no attempts at historical accuracy are implied.)<br/><br/>My friend Eric, who is also a writer and just sold a TV show was there, as well as Matt, who only had played d20 before -- neither of them had never played [I]Primetime Adventures[/I] before.  <br/><br/>As the Producer (GM) I decided that I really wanted to focus on the character's Issues -- Issues being things that stumble the character up when he's trying to get things done.  Matt didn't watch a lot of long form hour dramas (mostly sitcoms and shows like Futurama), but when I found out he loved [I]House[/I] I was all set, as I've watch enough of that show to take it apart and use pieces of it as examples for what we were needed to focus on for PtA.  (For example, House's issue is his impatience with people -- it's the very quality that let's him do his job well, as he has no time for people lies -- but it also means he makes trouble for himself when trying to talk to people -- which he has to do for his job.)<br/><br/>Eric created this old battle-loving knight, Lord Gregor, who was furious that after successfully waging war was sent by the king to become the "King's Justice" in Oxford instead of being sent off to a castle and continuing his love of war.  Eric did this awesome job of describing this guy -- "All most like an ancient tree, he's so worn from battle, as he rides his horse toward the city walls."  <br/><br/>And Matt came up with Marcus, this engineering prodigy who usually pays more attention to his blue prints than his pretty girlfriend Jill.  Marcus ends up pursuing a murderer when his Jill's brother -- a city guard -- is found brutally killed.<br/><br/>I was really happy how we nailed the premise of the series in the first sequence.  I framed an establishing shot of Lord Gregor riding with his retinue toward Oxford.  He rides through the city -- not being a city guy at all, very disdainful.  He gets to the large 'urban manor house' the king has bequeathed him.  The servants are all running around, getting everything ready, then standing at attention in the front hall as Gregor enters.  His Issue is Pride -- and he feels dissed by the king.  He let's loose on the staff, telling them he's been slighted by the king and roaring his frustration at being removed from battle.<br/><br/>I play the Conflict -- the king walks in behind him.  Gregor, in the heat of the moment, lets loose his frustration at the king.  After all he's done for him in war, how can he trap  him in these city walls?<br/><br/>The king takes him through a walk in the city: we do this montage sequence where the King shows him the streets -- the thieves, the homeless children, the wailing woman, the pickpocket, the men moving goods that look suspicious.  The king says, "This city is at war. With itself.  And I need my best general to drive this war to peace."<br/><br/>Boom. A prideful general who doesn't want to be there is tasked with waging a war on crime in the city streets.  Add in youthful and myopic Marcus who always sees the world as a mathematical problem to solve, and we're ready to go.<br/><br/>We had all this stuff ready to go about the conflict between religion and the new, scientific point of view and stuff...<br/><br/>Anyway... it was all great. <br/><br/>At the end of our session Matt said, "I wish we could keep playing. I'd love to watch this show."<br/><br/>And then I just got an email from Eric (who, again, just sold a pilot to CBS) and he said:<br/><br/><i>I keep coming back to that pilot episode. What a truly engaging session that was.  And after all our previous discussion that day, to have it culminate in an idea and characters that just practically sing "this is a TV show" -- well, damnit all, I wanna see that pilot now.</i><br/><br/>I spent the weekend up making up strong stories on the fly with smart, funny creative people all weekend.<br/><br/>Gateway rocked.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92854/#Comment_92854" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T21:03:27+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  9:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additional notes:<br/><br/>I approached the con sessions I ran with this attitude: I'm not doing the full show.  I may not get to a big ass climax.  Instead, I'm going from beginning to end with character creation and then we're doing the game at a pace and style that is the pace and style I'd use for my friends.  No rushing.  No making sure to get to the last fight.  No pre-gen characters for the <i>Sorcerer</i> game to get to the game sooner.  We're playing the game (and I think in these games character creation is part  of play), and that's it. <br/><br/>The same held true for all the games I played in except <i>Grey Ranks.</i>  In <i>Grey Ranks</i> we decided to play three chapters and we did it.<br/><br/>This all seemed to work well.  No one seemed frustrated at the end, and everyone only wanted to play <i>more</i>...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92858/#Comment_92858" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T21:55:45+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  9:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a great time at Gateway as well.  It was nice to get a good solid block of gaming in since my regular group has more or less disintegrated.  The SoCal indie gamers are a wonderful group of people who gave me an awesome experience in every game I played in.  Even the one game that frustrated me somewhat I look back on as a good experience, because I think I learned a lot from the discussion we had afterwards.  My con highlight is a toss up between the Roach game I was in and the My Life With Master game.  I had more fun participating in Roach but the GM's portrayal of the master in MLWM was sheer brilliance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92889/#Comment_92889" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T04:56:29+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  4:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, it's <i>Psi Run</i>, by the way!

Hopefully there will be some actual play from those.<br/></blockquote>\nI didn't totally grok the mechanic that night, but I think we all got it enough to play.  It seemed at least 2 of the 4 players had a damn good handle on it.  BTW, in hindsight, I realize if I'd asked more questions, I would have understood the mechanic better and had even more fun.  So, I can't give much insight mechanically.  But it was still TOTALLY AWESOME!<br/><br/>This is because, thematically it was amazing.  For me, the personal scenes made it even more powerful.  I'll share some of my favorite bits.  I forget some of the character names (heh, but remember npc names, weird).<br/><br/>In one scene, my character (16 year old male) was creeping up the stairs to the Nazi leisure werehouse, planning to knife the lone guard from behind.  Most the other Nazi's were out enjoying a night at the theater.  We were trying to break in and steal cigs and other goods to boost moral of the troops.  I announced that I was so nervous, because I'd never killed a man, this close, with a knife.  I'd only done killing at range with a rifle.  We cut to a personal scene from years back - it was my first day on the job at the butchers shop.  The butcher told me I had to kill the chickens.  I did, but loathed it so much I came back the next day and said I really needed the job (and my family needed the money), but could no longer kill the chickens as it was too disturbing.  The butcher drags him over to the chicken coop,forcefully puts a butcher knife in his hand, and while still holding on, stabs the knife into chicken after chicken, reminding him "this is your job", etc.  I refused to kill any on my own, lost the conflict, and lost the job.  Flash back to the mission, not wanting to fail, he drops the Nazi guard with stabs to the throat and kidneys.<br/><br/>During the middle mission of the evening we rescued camp bound people locked in rail cars.  At the end of the mission, one player detailed spotting his love, Helena (keep in mind, his symbol had to do with faith in Helena) sharing a cig with a Nazi guard.  So in the third mission, he angrily confronted her, she broke down crying, relaying that she'd had to befriend and sleep with Nazis to get medicine for her dying mom.  Holy crap!  The player lost his conflict, and Helena still was not forgiven.<br/><br/>It was depressing but extremely satisfying play.  I constantly found myself muttering the "oh god, no"s and "oh fuck"s when things went down.  I must play again.<br/><br/>Thanks to the players who made it awesome!  There were other great scenes, I'm sure some more will pop up here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xternal" title="xternal"><img alt="xternal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xternal">xternal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92957/#Comment_92957" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T11:44:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 11:44AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Ian Noble facilitated the <i>Grey Ranks</i> games, and his delivery of the background material (the true story of the teen-age partisans in Poland trying to defeat the Nazis in WWII) really set an amazing tone that produced a really moving session.

But I'm glad I did this.  It really let me focus appropriate attention on each player and let them, I think, dig into to the game, "get" how their input would be rewarded.  My reaction was:<i>This was like a perfect first session for a gaming group, we rock, and I can't wait to see where this goes over the next 5 or 8 sessions.</i></blockquote>\nI dug this game.  Having never played <i>Sorcerer</i>, it took a bit to slide into.  But from reading the book and talking about it, I know this is pretty typical.  By the time it started clicking, I was reallying enjoying it.  I'm completely with you on your reaction to the game.  Not only did I want to see how things went further, but, I was also left wanting to play <i>Sorcerer</i> or it's supplements again.  My only tiny regret was that I didn't remind myself I'd signed up for <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> and not just <i>Sorcerer</i>.

Friends of mine run Protospiel West, which apparently went very well indeed, and I was sad to miss.<br/><br/>Then, Sunday night, Shock: went really well, even with six players, two of them completely new to story games.  It was more than a little cool to see the lights come on for them.<br/><br/>And Monday I got to play Phoenicia with the above mentioned Protospiel gang, which was also cool, even if I got my ass handed to me.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, if OrcCon continues the trend, I may spontaneously develop bilocation, just to keep up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93003/#Comment_93003" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T14:25:16+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  2:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>The Strategicons just keep on getting better.

In the con environment there's no time to establish the minion's Connections as real people with real lives and goals and there's no time for the Master to be truly ruthless and start killing Connections and the like, and there's absolutely ZERO time to use the True Innocent rules which can jack the Fear level up.  So at the con My Life with Master plays a little bit like 18th Century Paranoia.<br/><br/>In a multi-session game with a little planning time and better pacing the game is a lot darker and a lot more tragic with the Overtures of Affection being much stronger beams of contrasting light in the surrounding horror.  It resembles much more the gothic romance I believe it's intended to be.<br/><br/>You still get the Master abusing his minion's More Than Humans and Less Than Humans and hurting each other's connections.  You still get the inconsistent praise and punishment and misappropriation of credit.  It's just a lot more sad and lot less funny.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93046/#Comment_93046" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T18:17:41+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  6:17PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love my local cons. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Despite coming to the Con already wiped out (long week at work), I ran an adequate <em>Dogs</em> game on Friday night and another adequate game of <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> Saturday morning.  I think I need to engineer some new situations to run at cons, because the four that I've got are getting a little old.<br/><br/>Then, Saturday night I ran a very successful <em>Sons of Liberty</em> playtest which resulted in just the right amount of feedback -- enough to chew on, but not so much you feel like scrapping large portions and going back to the drawing board.  (Just to geek out: the patriots established the Church of Franklin, raised an elephant army in India and brought it back to the colonies, and published pamphlets using Washington's teeth as a printing press.)<br/><br/>Then, Sunday, I was curiously left with absolutely nothing to do, so I hung out at the IPR booth (how did we end up doing, Paul?), played in Alejandro's unWritten playtest (awesome, although called early for headache), and ended up in InSpectres, which I hadn't had the pleasure of playing (also awesome, although Morgan the GM hardly got to play our dice were so hot).<br/><br/>Monday I ran <em>Primetime Adventures</em> for a clutch of folks most of whom had never played before, so it was nice spreading the <em>PTA</em> love.  Rockin game -- a family of vampires in 1920s Hollywood making movies about their memories, flashbacking to Renaissance Italy and squabbling over family rivalries.<br/><br/>I'm still recovering from the four days of high-power gaming, but I gotta say, I love these cons, and you should, too.  Come on out for OrcCon President's Day Weekend 2008!  I will most-likely-certainly-hope-to be releasing <em>Sons of Liberty</em> there, and we'll be in choice new digs at the Radisson because the con has got too big for its current space!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93047/#Comment_93047" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T18:19:11+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  6:19PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Come on out for OrcCon President's Day Weekend 2008!</blockquote>\nI was tempted to figure out how to come out to Gateway this year, but after GenCon it wasn't in the cards.

It was the first LARP I'd actually ever been in and I had maybe one of the most brilliant gaming experiences I've ever had ever over all.  It wasn't in a specific moment, but in the experience as a whole.  It's one thing to be sitting at a table and really feel a connection to your character.  It's another to WALK AROUND as your character.  You ARE your character.  People only knew me as 'Amelia' for the rest of the convention and vise versa (I in fact kept running into the Bishop later on Sunday, and we'd exchange a very courtly bow of the head in passing).  To be fair, though, I don't know how much my experience was enhanced by the game itself -- though I was totally in the business of Dreams, and that can never be bad -- or by the fact it was my first LARP.  Take it all with a grain of salt, I suppose.  But for a usually shy woman, I was wandering all over the place talking to total strangers about how best to facilitate their Dreams into reality.  <br/><br/>o When the Trio of Tragedies (Carry, Steal Away Jordon and Gray Ranks) was announced out of GenCon, I admit I had ZERO interest in all three.  So when Gray Ranks showed up on Gateway's play schedule, I smiled politely and kept moving on.  But then all these amazing stories came pouring out of Noble's games and I found a copy of the book in my hands and then I had to ask myself WHY AM I NOT PLAYING THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.  LIKE, THIS VERY SECOND.  LOLCATS CAPSLOCK ZOMG.  I'm eager to get a game going at home with my local group now, and I might have to resort to some straight out stalking to make sure I get into a con game in February.  Jason, you wrote a brilliant game with a deft and sympathetic hand.  I give you cookies.  And I'm a pastry chef, so I'm just sayin'.<br/><br/>o Also, I want to take a public moment and apologize to Will, Jesse, Alex and Meghann in regards to our Mutual Decision game.  I only realized after the fact (but before I wounded myself answering a phone) that I wasn't feeling so spectacular, especially after the game and into the discussion.  I could have handled my exit better and I didn't, so I apologize if that lead to even further tension.  It was a frustrating game experience with poor communication and my cranky impression of a six year old stomping out couldn't have helped.  So, again, I offer my apologies.<br/><br/>o My Sunday night gaming was cut short by the fact I nearly broke my foot answering my cell phone and had to go back to the hotel room to keep it iced.  That has to be one for the books somewhere. &gt;.&gt;;  <br/><br/>In closing, I had a really great time where I got to see a lot of really great people and hear about and play some really great games -- and I'm THRILLED to hear even more great people will be planning on coming down in February!  Hurray for Ryan Macklin, Albert A and Nancy!   Know now that I'm holding you to this, and any sort of retraction on your part will lead to certain doom.  DOOM.<br/><br/>-- L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93264/#Comment_93264" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T16:14:39+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  4:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Laura -- let me put it this way:<br/><br/>The larp went so well, we made Ryan the convention's new LARP coodinator!<br/><br/>(well, okay, it was being planned before that but if there was any more proof needed, Ryan *gets* larps.)<br/><br/>So, in the future, we'll be seeing more higher-quality larps.<br/><br/>(and I'm really sorry you hurt your foot...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93266/#Comment_93266" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T16:27:53+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  4:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

It's got more parking (and street parking) and has some excellent gaming locations (like the penthouse bar which is an amazing space)<br/><br/>Importantly, RPGs will still have their own private rooms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/okiran" title="okiran"><img alt="okiran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/okiran">okiran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93288/#Comment_93288" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T18:18:59+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  6:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was my second Strategicon and it was better than the first (back in February).  Only three of the four games I played are worth mentioning.  <br/><br/>Saturday morning I played my first ever session of Dogs.  My character was the younger brother of another PC, so I mostly followed his lead.  I feel I probably could have brought more to this game.  I like the dice mechanic and I'd really like to play this game again.  <br/><br/>My second game . . . attempting to purge from memory . . .<br/><br/>My third game was the Sons of Liberty playtest.  It took me a while to get the hang of this game.  I played Alexander Hamilton.  I didn't realize until half way though the game that could have a clockwork army even though Hamilton wasn't an inventor.  Also, it was hard to follow everything going on, but that' was by design and part of the game's charm.  We ended up losing to the Tories.  However, some of were having so much fun we forgot we were trying to win the game.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I played The Roach.  A great way to start the day.  Even if you remain unRoached.  And having Jessie torment . . . I mean, plenty of unpleasantness befall my character.  Great fun, though.<br/><br/>Things I'm sad I missed:  all the other awesome games I've read in this thread <a href="http://nerdsocal.com/?q=node/513#comment-1066" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>.<br/><br/>-James<br/><br/>Lawyer-Priest of the Church of Franklin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93340/#Comment_93340" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T00:21:00+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 12:21AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I guess I'll chime in now. Gateway 2007 completely rocked! I know I came to the IPR booth on Saturday planning to buy and I sure did. I bought <i>Carry, Don't Rest Your Head, Mortal Coil, Mechaton: Giant Fighty Robots, Prime Time Adventures, Agon and With Great Power...</i> I love all my shiny new books.<br/><br/>As for the games I played (fair warning: geek out starts here) Fantastic! I started off in CK's PTA game <i>Cult of Personality</i> on Friday. This was my first PTA experience but once we got the rules down, it really flowed nicely from scene to scene. Murderous mayhem ensued, but the scene framing mechanics kept the game focussed on the show we were creating and the game never spiraled out of control into gonzo-land. Very rewarding, lots of surprises.<br/><br/>Next, Josh's Dogs game, which he has described as adequate, but which was much better than that. I could tell Josh was tired and I think it did impact the game a little. Pacing didn't go quite as smoothly as the town he ran last con, but it was still very rewarding with very cool conflicts. Josh, you're being hyper-critical. Best quote was when we were thinking about marrying the Steward's daughter to a boy she loved. David (new to Dogs) says "Well, we don't want to go over the Steward's head." And Will and I respond "We are over the Steward's head."<br/><br/>Saturday morning I ran Dogs in a new town that I created after reading Jason Morningstar's <i>Fort Lemon Branch</i>. I basically stole the woman who wants to be Steward idea and also the notion of a branch fleeing the East and arriving at a heathen trading post, then added lots of my own stuff. Tons of conflict with three putative branch leaders and a real power vacuum. The Dogs decided that the woman was the best bet and then went to stomp on the New Prophet of the King. It was lots of fun and I owe a debt of gratitude to Noble, Devilmaycare, Willh, Sarah and Ryan who came over to my house and playtested the game (it was my first time running <i>Dogs</i>) the week before Gateway. That session pointed out where things went pear shaped, so I could fix the holes before the main event. Thanks folks!<br/><br/>I played in Holly's <i>Polaris </i>game that afternoon with Willh and Michael, who had never even heard of <i>Polaris</i> until Vasco pushed him into the game. It was my first time playing and the ritual phrasing took a little getting used to, but the game was very neat. It was neat seeing Michael struggle with the narrative control aspect of the game. I was really screwing his character over. Hey, I was his mistaken. And then it finally clicked and I could see it in his eyes that he had narrative control too. He didn't have to take my shit if he didn't want to. I wasn't his GM and he had as much free reign with his protagonist as I did.<br/><br/>At 8 pm Colin ran the <i>Burning Wheel</i> con scenario "The Gift" about an elvish prince and his retinue that travel to the dwarf kingdom to honor a newly crowned Dwarvish prince and to forge an alliance that both sides need. The scenario is tightly woven with tensions running high between and among the elves and the dwarves. Suffice it to say that after many duels of wits and a combat between the elven sword singer and the dwarven battle warden, the dwarf prince accepted the elves' gift and became an "elf friend" by receiving the Song of Friendship from the mouth of the dying elven loremaster. The elven swordsinger, after pulling his blade out of the loremaster's torso, faded away into the West. And the elven prince returned home after losing both the most renowned elven champion and the King's loremaster, but successfully completing his mission of forging an alliance with those abrasive, greedy dwarfs.<br/><br/>Midnight is the time for Colin's <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> game (yes, I'm guilty of Bogarting the Colin), which is sick and twisted and completely awesome. My character was an orphan with the power to make things burn, who just wanted his freedom. He ended up escaping Mother Wenn's Ladies in Hating, destroying the Tacks Man and finally staying in the Mad City to join the ink stained News Boys in their nightly runs of anarchic destruction. He found his freedom in the Mad City, which is more than some find. If you ever get a chance to play when Colin runs <i>Don't Rest Your Head,</i> you must do it. I don't care how little sleep you're going to get.<br/><br/>The next morning it was the Roach, another first for me. The game was loads of madcap fun, with 5 out of the 7 characters roached. Thanks to Jesse for facilitating a great game and playing one of the more memorable characters. I really enjoyed all the political back stabbing, interspersed with roach commands making people do weird things.<br/><br/>Then came Colin's Spirit of the Force game. Last con I played the <i>young jedi on a dark path</i> and ended the session by reaching into the dark side to kill a Sith carrying two ancient glowing red light sabers. Then I lost to the dark side, taking the severe consequence of picking up the Sith blades <i>Pain</i> and <i>Despair</i>. So, this con I was all fired up to play this guy again, but when we got into the room there were these two kids who had obviously not seen SOTC or any story-games before and I thought they would enjoy being Luke, while I took the Han Solo-esque character. Let me just say the awesome went all the way to 11 and then some. We fought shuttles from speeding trains and flew speeders. We got on board an Imperial Star Destroyer and seized contol, sending it into its fellows in a fiery ball of explosive goodness. The final scene erupted with conflict galore. My character, suffering from paranoia due to toying with the dark side, pulls his gun on the young jedi and tells him to "Back away from my sister!" who happens to be the young fellow's paduan and his love. The force mystic in the group tries to snag my blaster and I plug him full of holes, but not before completely exhausting my fate points and having to call upon the dark side cuz I have the aspect, "I'll do anything to save my sister." I'm battling to get away from the dark force rippling through my body, but I'm out of points and totally vulnerable, until the guy I just blew away comes to my aid from the other side of the void and starts compelling my light side aspects. He saves me. And that's when my sister consumed by the dark side herself runs me through with her glowing Sith blade. I loved this game! And the kids finally grokked SOTC and ended the day with one killing the young jedi and heading off into the sunset with the girl.<br/><br/>Sunday night I was supposed to play XMS: Impact, Jim Pinto's game of wrestling roleplay, but the game was called on account of bad weather, so I just sat and talked to folks in the lobby. Jim, we will have to play that game sometime soon.<br/><br/>Monday morning was my last game of the con and what a great note to end on. Josh ran a great session of PTA called <i>Thicker Than Water</i> which WillH has talked about as well. We played the Prospero Family, owners of Prospero Productions in 1920's Hollywood. We were also vampires from Renaissance Italy who were making films in order to record our memories. The game started off with the murder of a rival studio. My character played a rising hollywood star and prodigal son of the Prospero patriarch who had trouble dealing with the fact that in creating me, mating with my vampire father killed my mortal mother (these vampires can't have children unless they infect a mortal and then mate with them). I admit to the killing in order to piss off dad and lots of good stuff ensues, particularly a heartfelt jail house scene with my half sister Bianca.<br/><br/>I have to say it, once again. Gateway 2007 was fantastic! Thank you Noble and Ptevis for your work in setting everything up. I'm jazzed for Orccon in Feb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93442/#Comment_93442" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T09:01:04+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  9:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><br/>You also forgot the midnight<i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>game that Collin ran.

At an 11. And thanks to everyone who worked so hard this year to make Stratigcon such a great experience.<br/><br/>I ran a whole crapload of games and they were all a blast.<br/><br/>This con I ran 3 Spirit of the Force games, and each was a totally different game which rocked. The Friday game went all crazy Dark Side and the last act was an insane Reservoir Dogs sequence in which everyone but one character died. One Jedi ignited his saber on himself and a fallen comrade which was very cool. The Saturday game resulted in the players fighting off the darkness due to a few players tireless efforts of save the last of the Jedi and Sunday\xe2\u20ac\u2122s game had half the party falling during the big climax and the Jedi Spirit of one of the players saving the remaining Jedi from beyond in a pretty intense bit of role-playing and aspect compelling. And what can I say I love convincing players to take that sweet sweet dark sided candy. <br/><br/>I also ran the Burning Wheel scenario the Gift. And that flat out rocked. I was really surprised at how quickly the table groked the scripting mechanics for both the Dual of Wits and Fight! The best part of this game is that I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have to run anything. So I just walked around whispering in ears, pointing out BITs on the sheets and directing the scripts. Big fun and everyone at the table brought the awesome.<br/><br/>And immediately after running BW, I ran Don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t Rest Your Head Midnight game. The game went well and was packed with much insanity and tones of messed up stuff from offing Wax Knights with a Power Auger to Scarecrow Bus Drivers.<br/><br/>Play wise I was in the Friday Gray Ranks game, and let me just say that game is simply amazing and the story we created was bleak and compelling. <br/><br/>I also played in game 3 of Noble\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Heroquest Lord of the Rings game, and well\xe2\u20ac\xa6 I got mauled/ripped in half by Smaug the Dragon. We did manage to recapture Fornost and crush the Witchking\xe2\u20ac\u2122s army though. Also our Elf went toe to toe with the Witchking and through some damn lucky dice rolling almost defeated him, but in the end died never having seen his new born son. <br/><br/>And finally I playing in My Life With Master and about half way through the game I kinda of just sat back in awe at Jesse\xe2\u20ac\u2122s master which was honestly the best NPC in a game, evar. Between Jesse, Noble\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Butler and Hollian\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Nursemaid I couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t stop laughing.
