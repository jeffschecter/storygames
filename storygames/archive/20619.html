Perhaps take to another thread? Anyway it doesn't really matter that you can't draw a brightline distinction between the two, if there is a spectrum with a lot of games more or less at one end and a lot of games more or less at the other.<br/><br/>To be fair, part or most of what this thread is about is explaining why some people do not prefer "coherent" games. There is nothing to stop "trad" games from being "coherent" (even if most are not).<br/><br/>Points (1), (2) and (3) above regarding campaign play obviously do not distinguish trad games from ALL "indie" games; this is just a matter of trends, to explain how people tend to behave, not a matter of logical proof. <br/><br/>You are of course right that "indie" describes a commercial arrangement; hence I have used sneer quotes around that word (!). But what is the better word to use? Forge-influenced or "narrativist" games? <br/><br/>As for trad, I'm not sure why you say "no such tradition exists"; to me a trad game is more or less any game where the majority of players do not have shared narrative authority and the GM can apply rule zero and bend the rules and, I guess, can handle time in a freeform way outside combat; on the precedent of White Wolf salon LARPs, games with assistant GMs etc. still count as traditional. <br/><br/>Thus, PbtA games probably are not strictly trad in the sense I have defined, because the players choose their "yes, but" results from listed options, and the GMs are more rulebound than in core examples of trad games. However PbtA feels trad in play because there is not enough in PbtA to really distinguish the feel of it from the feel of trad games. Even if the way players pick the "yes, but" outcomes is the anithesis of trad, it's not really a big intrusive thing in play. However, possibly not much distinguishes Burning Wheel from a trad game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452328/#Comment_452328" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T01:40:58+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  1:40AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is not really the thread for talking about the significance or insignificance of the supposed "indie"/trad distinction.</blockquote>\nNot to be contrarian, but\n<blockquote>What this thread is for, is to help gamers with a strong "indie" preference to understand why some trad gamers continue to stay trad and reject "indie" games even after having some experience of playing them...</blockquote>\nBut this sound like exactly the thread to talk about that distinction, you know, considering it's that very distinction that's being discussed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452329/#Comment_452329" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T03:20:58+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  3:20AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Indie" is a bad term for this purpose, yes. "Coherent" is much better, provided one subscribes to the analysis underlying it. I myself prefer "progressive" as the counterpart to "traditional", and "Forgite" if one actually wants to discuss the cultural impact of Forge-originated games as a whole. The advantage of a term that does not attempt an analytical description ("Forge-originated" or "Forgite" does not actually imply anything about content) is that one does not need to talk simultaneously about design analytics and cultural history.<br/><br/>(And I do, of course, disagree with Jason about whether the tradition exists. One merely needs to take a list of the 20 or so most popular cornerstone ideas in roleplaying games and trace their evolution through the history of the hobby to ascertain that yes, the mainstream of the rpg design field has always been very traditional, with relatively few exceptions. The reason that people perceive e.g. Forgite and Nordic freeform games as different is exactly because they make a break from the tradition and largely start anew from first precepts. It's no different from art history in any other medium.)<br/><br/>Aside from quibbling with terminology (pointless when everybody actually understands what he's talking about), I don't think that there's anything wrong with Omni's list. Those are all fine reasons to like games that do those things, whether you think that only trad games do them or not.<br/><br/>For my own part I practically ignore the vast majority of trad games, but not because of structural issues like these; the usual reason is that, as the characterization "traditional" suggests, these games rarely offer me interesting and fresh experiences. There are definitely exceptions, trad games that I feel are provocative and intellectually relevant; they usually achieve this by either being authoritative treatments on their subject matter, or by having literary merit head and shoulders above any alternatives. Examples of trad games where I have no difficulty whatsoever understanding the appeal are things like Paranoia, Pendragon, Ars Magica, Delta Green, JAGS Wonderland, GURPS. There are others as well, of course, to a greater or lesser degree.<br/><br/>What I wrote above can be expressed more succinctly by saying that I don't like games that are mediocre. That's not so strange, I think, and holds as well for proge games as trad ones - it's not like there aren't many games outside the mainstream tradition that are unimaginative, repetitive and redundant in the field as a whole. I suspect that many "indie enthusiasts" hold similar positions on this, even if their opinions on which games are or aren't relevant to their interests differ.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452332/#Comment_452332" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T04:11:34+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:11AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 4:12AM by liblarva.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I am not starting this thread to convince you that trad games are better than "indie" games or that you would enjoy them more.

And very thorough. (I can't think of anything offhand to add to it, though I hope others will.)<br/><br/>In my experience, familiarity and nostalgia are also big drivers of people preferring to play trad games. (And, no, I don't look down on that: both are very reasonable things.)<br/><br/>There are also types of games and traditions which are BETTER suited by "trad" rulesets and playstyles. For instance, I can think of:<br/><br/>* OSR-style gaming<br/>* "Illusionist" or "Participationist" play; where an auteur GM provides an experience for a relatively passive group of players looking forward to experiencing the GM's story<br/><br/>There are probably others. Some simulationist kinds of play might be relevant.<br/><br/>Having said that, I agree that some of these are misguided/misleading, and that's where the "familiarity" thing comes in. <br/><br/>While indie gamers, as a group, do tend to play a lot more short-form and one-shot games than the typical "trad" gamer (as far as I can see, anyway), this isn't in any way mandated by the rules of the games they play. D&amp;D is just as well-suited to a one-shot as Dogs in the Vineyard, and, indeed, the majority of well-received and popular "indie" games are designed for campaign play. I see this as more a matter of the play culture than as a feature of design method.<br/><br/>Issues like "character immersion" are notoriously hard to pin down. The Pundit says that fear mechanics are immersive... others don't want anyone to interfere with their character's mental process at all. Yet others like to immerse in character but can only do so in freeform roleplay (because consulting rulebooks ruins it for them), while yet another group needs an agreed-upon ruleset they trust to fully "immerse" themselves in play.<br/><br/>I also agree that "the rules cover everything" is a bit of an illusion, bolstered by "rule zero". D&amp;D says that "you can do anything", but this is patently untrue. Just try to create a character who is an aging banker or a 5-yr-old prodigal telekinetic with no understanding or control over his powers... a lot of "indie" designs claim to be more focused in their texts, but, in reality, can be applied freely and evenly to any genre and any situation much more flexibly than a typical trad game.<br/><br/>Great thread thus far; I'll be reading along eagerly and looking forward to more input.<br/><br/>For what it's worth:\n<blockquote><br/>What I wrote above can be expressed more succinctly by saying that I don't like games that are mediocre.

A lack of understanding of the goals and procedures of a given game. I'd like to know what I'm playing and why, and how to go about it. How do I play this game *well*, how do I engage with it fully, and make it fun for my fellow players? A lot of "trad" texts are really unhelpful here, but, generally it has more to do with the people:<br/><br/>2. The common culture of obfuscation which often exists in "trad" gaming. Illusionism (railroading) is a common example, but it extends to other things, even going so far as to shame people who try to talk about the game at all. Articles like "Make sure your players don't find out!" are prime culprits here, and many gamers internalize such knowledge. "A good GM never lets the players in on the secret."

Mixing it the way you've done sounds like <i>secret keeping</i> and <i>setting exploration</i> are matters of taste while <i>rules for every situation</i> is a universal virtue.  This will simply invite people to correct you on how, nope, that ain't universal.  Personally, I'd phrase the list like this:\n<blockquote>Some people consciously stick with traditional RPGs despite having tried non-traditional RPGs because they prefer:<br/> <br/>(1) campaign play<br/><br/>(2) being able to get a sense of how the game plays from the tons and tons of people playing it<br/><br/>(3) familiar rules<br/><br/>(4) solely playing one character<br/><br/>(5) real-seeming settings<br/><br/>(6) using dice and rules to resolve success or failure, with no competing goals to distract from that<br/><br/>(7) mysterious settings<br/><br/>(8) keeping player knowledge and character knowledge as close together as possible<br/><br/>(9) variety to suit different player tastes<br/><br/>(10) rules for all sorts of situations</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/liblarva">@liblarva</a>, I think all your points about roleplaying are solid, but they're more refutations of the OP's <i>phrasing</i> than of his <i>intent</i>.

I guess we'll see.<br/><br/>As long as I'm butting in here, I guess I should clarify that I think "help indie gamers understand why some trad gamers choose to stay trad" is impossible, as nearly all indie gamers have played trad games and enjoyed them at least somewhat, so that virtually anyone with <i>any</i> interest in this phenomenon already <i>does</i> understand it well enough.  Absolutely nothing in this thread is going to be "news" or some kind of eye-opening shock.  My hope is that it'll simply serve as a <i>reminder</i> for some of us who may have forgotten things we used to like.  <br/><br/>Although if the one gamer who loves indie RPGs, but somehow hates trad RPGs without ever having played them, wanders through and gets their eyes opened, that's cool too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452341/#Comment_452341" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T06:56:25+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  6:56AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.

The features he listed are also in the main ones that would not surprise me as real-life reasons for somebody choosing to play a trad game over some more marginal type of game, which makes me think that the list is overall at least in the correct ballpark, and not in any glaring error.<br/><br/>Whether the distinction between "trad" and whatever else exists in reality, or merely in the heads of people like Omni, is besides the point, because he is not listing objective, Jason-verified historical trends in game design. Even if a continuous tradition of form did not exist in rpgs, that would not affect the validity of a list describing people's impressions and beliefs: if somebody opts to stick to games he views as "traditional" over games he views as "indie" over one of the issues on Omni's list, this occurrence doesn't really stop existing merely because somebody in the Internet proves that the decision is based on less than perfect understanding of rpg history.<br/><br/>If you'd like to make your own list, it might be interesting to compare: what do <i>you</i> think are common reasons for people to internalize the ideas of "trad" vs "indie" and then choose the former over the latter?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452361/#Comment_452361" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T11:38:07+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 11:38AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 12:12PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>(8) people may prefer to be able to keep player secrets from other players, either out of fear that other people will metagame and use out-of-character knowledge to their characters' advantage, or out of a preference for being mysterious</blockquote>\nRule zero, don't play with dicks. Subrule zero-one. Every gamer I've ever met in my life has been willing to tell me everything they've ever put to paper about their character... a great length... whether I wanted that information or not. I've never met one in 30+ years of gaming locally face-to-face, at local or regional conventions, or in more than a decade of online play that doesn't want to tell everyone everything about their character.</blockquote>\nThen allow me to open your eyes.<br/><br/>Just to be totally clear, my favoured style of play includes not just the GM and assistant GM but even the pure players having secrets that other pure players don't know. This is because it makes the game more mysterious and authentic for the other pure players. I remember playing in a couple of games where other players revealed to me, in an out-of-character way, their characters' malevolent schemes directed at my character, so that I knew, but my character didn't. I <b>deeply</b> resented that because it spoilt that aspect of the game for me. To be clear, I was perfectly OK with being the target of these schemes within the fiction. What made the out-of-character revelations upsetting for me was that I would far rather be at liberty to think purely as my character, with confidence that I am not influenced subconsciously by my out-of-character knowledge of the fiction, and without having to strain to mentally separate what I know about the fiction from what my character knows. By spilling the beans, the players I refer to made that impossible for me. As a subsidiary/ancillary problem, they also prevented me from engaging with their schemes as an honest challenge of skill, and they made it so that I could not genuinely figure it out for myself, and even if I had already done so prior to them telling me, I would now have looked like a metagaming cheat if I had relied on what I had previously figured out in my in-character decisions.<br/><br/>If you have never met anyone who wanted to keep in-character secrets secret, then your horizons are exceptionally narrow. I have played countless roleplaying games (especially live roleplaying games) where keeping secrets from other players is the staple of the game (or at least a significant element in it). I do not give a damn hoot whether the person's reason for wanting to keep those secrets is that that person is worried that other players would metagame, or simply prefers to keep an air of mystery about them as an aesthetic or narcissistic preference, or whether their reason is (as mine often is) that they want to inject an element of mystery into the player-on-player interactions in the game for the enjoyment of all.<br/><br/>By strongly and clearly implying that anyone who wants to keep in-character secrets secret from other players is a dick, you have managed to insult my favourite playstyle and thousands of perfectly sensible, reasonable, amiable, thoughtful and imaginative players who prefer to play that way. Not that I really mind in all honesty; you've done it out of pure ignorance, not malice. But I would invite you to reconsider your position in light of what I've said here, and certainly to reconsider how you phrase it.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that you have been the target audience of a million and one fatbeardgasms from people salivating over their character sheets, but it is one thing to tell someone who is not playing in the same game as you all your character's secrets, and entirely another thing to inflict purely out-of-character knowledge of those secrets on your fellow players who are playing in that same game, such as to spoil their enjoyment of that game.<br/><br/><b>OF COURSE</b> I know that many gamers, including many trad gamers (and probably most "indie" gamers), expect all information about player characters (and in "indie" games sometimes even all information about the fiction as a whole) to be open knowledge among the players even if their characters don't know. <b>OF COURSE</b> I have heard people say things like "we're all mature enough roleplayers that you can trust us to treat out-of-character and in-character knowledge separately". But I don't give a hoot about that; it totally misses the point. The secret-keeping style of play that I love doesn't just give the potentially apprehensive player reassurance that the game will be played with a straight bat. More importantly, much more importantly, it facilitates an authentic, mysterious feel for the game, of a specific kind that games without secret-keeping cannot ever exactly duplicate. It is irrelevant that you may enjoy how your PbtA games enable you to provide what you describe as mystery for the GM; that is an entirely different kind of experience that you are talking about (I do not mean better or lesser, I simply mean different). Games without secret-keeping are <b>NO USE AT  ALL</b> from the point of view of producing the particular kind of authentic mystery vibe that many people enjoy and I personally love best (and that many other people either hate or are completely ignorant of).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452362/#Comment_452362" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T11:38:16+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 11:38AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 11:45AM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>(10) people like games with rules for any sort of situation their character might end up in, whether it's an exciting or poignant or dramatic situation, or a so-so situation, just so that (because the rules are there) they (the players) have the freedom to take their characters into those situations and see what happens - so that (in a sense) it feels like real life (because anything can happen)</blockquote>\nPatently false. Most trad gamers like games with rules <i>for certain things, but not others</i>. Social conflict for one. Most trad gamers blanch at the idea of even having social conflicts, much less rules for social conflicts. "The shopkeeper's willing to haggle." "He can haggle with my sword!" (Actual quote.) Probably a rule zero situation.</blockquote>\nAs in more or less all the items in my list, I meant that this applies to <b>some</b> people's enjoyment of the game, not all. Fair enough, I should have phrased the post more clearly (and I have now edited to do so), but you might have inferred it from how the list started with the sentence "Reasons why some people consciously stick with trad games..." (I have edited it now to bold that). Most of your post seems to have been written on the entirely false assumption that when I wrote "people like..." or words to that effect I somehow presumed to say that "I in my high and mighty wisdom as the grand poobah of roleplay do decree and pronounce, that all persons great and small in the history of time have in common with each other, that they are favourably disposed towards..." No, I did not. I am not talking about <b>all</b> trad gamers. I am talking in the case of each item on the list about <b>some</b> trad gamers. I am talking about trends, not absolutes.<br/><br/>I happen to be one of the trad gamers who wants much denser rules for combat than for social situations. Social conflict is generally speaking of the essence of an enjoyable game for me, but I personally hate to have detailed, intrusive rules for it, and cannot imagine enjoying "social combat" handled with a similar style of rules to actual combat, at any rate to anything like the extent to which I enjoy a more freeform style of play. Having said that, the RPG project closest to my heart, Soul's Calling, does include rules on social conflict of a certain kind that I deem to be optimal for my preferred tabletop RPG playstyle (i.e. more appealing to me than no social conflict rules at all for tabletop RPGs, though not for LARPs). The trick is that in Soul's Calling the influence of the rules is largely filtered through the GM's human judgement rather than being direct. I have used a watered down version of the same for my simpler, more easy-going, trad/"indie" hybrid game Implodarc (for which I am desperately looking for playtesters if anyone is interested).<br/><br/>Anyway being anal about it clearly even those trad gamers who like the sorts of social conflict mechanics that I personally hate (such as how recent editions of D&amp;D, at any rate I believe 3rd and 5th, handle social conflict) would baulk at having rules for literally everything, if "literally everything" includes time needed to visit the latrine, etc. But that misses the point which is that one of the attractions for some players of trad games over "indie" games is that "trad" games often have specific rules for a wide variety of situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452363/#Comment_452363" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T11:59:04+00:00" title="April 20, 2016 11:59AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay.

It is entirely sufficient that we have a loosely defined and generally understood notion of games tending to one end or the other of a spectrum (or several spectrums that tend to correlate with each other).

What matters is that there are games that can be considered a "central case" of trad or "indie" and others that seem to cluster around them sharing similar characteristics to a greater or lesser degree, and that we can talk about reasons why people might tend on the whole to be drawn to one cluster or the other (even if some of those people might also like particular games in the other cluster under particular circumstances).<br/><br/>I propose that the central cases of a "trad" RPG would include AD&amp;D 1st edition, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 2nd edition, Dragon Warriors, possibly White Wolf games (such as V:tM or V:tR) or (from reputation) GURPS. I propose that the central cases of an "indie" RPG would include Dogs in the Vineyard, OctaNe, Fiasco or Montsegur 1244, and probably Duty and Honour (the only one of these that I have not played is Dogs in the Vineyard). Games such as Burning Wheel, Fate and PbtA (of which the only one that I have played is PbtA, but I have played Mouse Guard) are more borderline. As I have mentioned, the one game of PbtA that I played did not feel significantly different to trad games to me, in actual play. Whereas OctaNe, Duty and Honour and up to a certain point (though less so) Montsegur 1244 had quite a different feel.<br/><br/>Since this is all about typical trends, and clusters of games around central cases, so as to give practical insight into human behaviour, any attempt to analyse it in terms of absolutes is misconceived.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452367/#Comment_452367" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T15:37:59+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  3:37PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any way to describe an "impression" that there was a trend in Forge-games away from campaign play other than "wrong"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452374/#Comment_452374" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T16:03:37+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:03PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 4:05PM by omnifray.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>, let's put it this way.

If 95% of playing hours devoted to pre-Forge and non-Forge games are in campaign games and 75% of playing hours devoted to Forge games are in campaign games, then Forge games are arguably, on the whole, as a general trend, less campaign-oriented than pre-Forge and non-Forge games. What exactly the stats are, I don't know, but I can't think of a single trad RPG that is as unsuitable for campaign play as, say, Montsegur 1244 or Fiasco or Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne or I Would Do Anything For Lady Katya (if I remember the name of that one correctly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452376/#Comment_452376" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T16:32:03+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:32PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 4:40PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dallas?

In other words, it might well be that an "indie" game could conceivably appeal to a particular traddie, but that traddie has played ten different "indie" games that he didn't like, just not yet that particular one that he would be suited to. He might, in the process of playing and rejecting those ten games, have formed a generally negative view of non-trad games, i.e. a prejudice and preconception (much as some trad-to-indie converts have formed of trad games from their dire experiences of D&amp;D3e).<br/><br/>This is why even if the trend is only very partial it may be worth listing in my list:- because it may contribute to the overall picture that emerges, even if it has no application at all to many games.<br/><br/>I am not sure why you assume that Paranoia is not suited to campaign play (but I only have limited experience of it). I know nothing about Dallas or Toon. I suspect with Paranoia, Dallas and Toon you are listing games that are really very fringe within trad gaming, whereas games like Fiasco, Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne or Montsegur 1244 are or have been some of the most frequently mentioned at any rate on RPG-related and storygame-related sites. Plus they are among the clearest cases of being purely "indie" and not trad.<br/><br/>I don't know what craziness causes you to doubt the case for AD&amp;D1e being a central case of a trad game. Surely it is the trad game to end all trad games, or at any rate to give rise to them all. <b>One trad game to rule them, one trad game to find them, one trad game to bring them all and in the traddiness bind them.</b> Because it commercialised the trad RPG concept more than any prior game did (OD&amp;D for instance) and spread the message to the world. I have no idea how you would say that it's not trad, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452392/#Comment_452392" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T18:02:43+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  6:02PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If all we're saying is "yeah, some people have limited experience and that leads them to make decisions about what they like and don't like in ways that seem opaque to those with wider or different experiences", I totally agree.

(Although I bet there are lots of trad games which fail his criteria, and lots of "indie" games which fulfill them.
