Though I do consider <b>Delve 2nd</b> and<b> Dungeon Degenerates</b> visually interesting as well and am somewhat curious about Delves d100 system. <b>SURVIVE THIS!!</b> and <b>Boast</b> aren\u2019t bad, just in genres which currently just aren\u2019t my cup of tea. They might still be worth a look if you like superheroes or pirates.<br/>I do like the design of the <b>Infinity D4</b> dice and they\u2019ll likely fit well into a <b>Premium Dicebox</b>. This time around I did add a \u201eHelpful card decks\u201c segment, which contains quite some cool decks to help GMs and players with improvisation. Next to that I think <b>HLG Con</b> might be worth checking out if you are looking for a convention with a distinct focus on Larp and quite some World of Darkness stuff. Oh, and there is the <b>Muertos Iluminados</b> playing card game, which I think looks really pretty.<br/>There are plenty more projects, just have a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>5 Role-Playing Games<br/>6 Supplements<br/>3 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>3 Adventures<br/>3 D&amp;D and PFRPG Adventures<br/>5 Dice Projects<br/>4 Dice Accessoires<br/>2 Map Projects<br/>2 Enamel Pins<br/>3 Helpful card decks<br/>6 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Card game<br/>2 Other Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Adventure Path<br/>1 RPG Hybrid<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 Map project<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Gamebook<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/>Blog Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/01/crowdfunding-collection-78/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/07/01/crowdfunding-collection-78/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475152/#Comment_475152" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-01T22:24:25+00:00" title="July  1, 2018 10:24PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's this "Delve" game?<br/><br/>I only know of <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg%27s">@David_Berg's</a> version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475153/#Comment_475153" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-01T22:44:16+00:00" title="July  1, 2018 10:44PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the description its a basically a d100 dungeon crawler which took inspiration from the OSR.

I followed its development via the blog of Onyx Path Publishing and was intrigued by what I read. The setting sounds really cool, and I liked the VtR2 game I played. Thus, I have had to back it and it is one of the few OPP projects I do back because I believe in it. It has a delivery date of 2020, yet I think it\u2019s worth the wait and recommend it. <b>John Silence</b> is a new project by Josh Jordan and offers a Urban Fantasy with two engaging premises. On the one hand the player characters aren\u2019t white folks, on the other hand the conflict resolution isn\u2019t that much focused on physically overpowering. Given the presentation, strong Kickstarter record, I couldn\u2019t resist, invest in it and do recommend it. I am still hesitating to back <b>Tiny Supers</b>. Alan Bahrs newest entry to the TinyD6 system family. I enjoyed the previous projects a lot, yet \u201esuperhero\u201c isn\u2019t that much my genre and I do still need to save up for GenCon.<br/>Similarly I am currently on the brink of backing <b>Behind the Masc Zine</b>, a magazine talking about games and a non-cis view on masculinity. Next to those I would recommend taking a look at <b>Killing Lee Garvin</b>, it\u2019s not an RPG but a card game. Yet it looks fun, has a tabletop rpg theme and you\u2019ll help the designer Lee Garvin with his medical expenses.<br/>Another game that ain\u2019t a RPG is the <b>Edible Games Cookbook</b>. It isn\u2019t a cookbook one can eat, but one to be used to literally cook-up games. I do really like the idea and recommend you\u2019ll have a look.<br/>There are many more cool projects, like the <b>Mars Sourcebook</b> for Space 1889, just have a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Setting<br/>1 Supplements<br/>1 Adventure<br/>1 Dice Project<br/>4 Dice Accessoires<br/>1 RPG Magazin<br/>2 Map &amp; Terrain Projects<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Games with RPG-Connection<br/>1 Another cool Game Projects (Cookbook)<br/><br/><b>Portuguese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Supplements<br/><br/>Blog article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-79/" rel="nofollow"><b>https://teylen.blog/2018/07/08/crowdfunding-collection-79/</b></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475268/#Comment_475268" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-09T09:43:46+00:00" title="July  9, 2018  9:43AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Geist                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475539/#Comment_475539" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-19T20:32:39+00:00" title="July 19, 2018  8:32PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/19/crowdfunding-collection-80/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 80, including every tabletop project started between 07.08 and 07.19.</a></b><br/><br/>The incoming GenCon has apparently motivated quite a lot of creatives and thus you\u2019ll find no fewer than 13 projects for new rpgs alone. Well, and while I had the best intentions to safe up for the big event, I couldn\u2019t resist a few gems.<br/>I got swept by <b>Demon City</b>, a new, modern horror game by Zak S. I backed his patreon before and thus had been already convinced by the astonishing artwork as well as by the rule system. You\u2019ll find that it uses a tarot card deck, yet one might as well use regular d6. Next to that the stretch goals are quite cool as well.<br/>Of course I couldn\u2019t resist the second edition of <b>Greg Stolze\u2019s Reign</b>. The fantasy setting is nice and somewhat different, yet what sold me most is the one-roll engine/system. I am as intruiged by the ORE that it basically got this very blog started as I pondered if I could convert V:tM to it \u2013 I couldn\u2019t or rather was to lazy to do it. The fact that Greg mentions that he might be working with \u201esomeone from White Wolf\u201c for a contemporary ORE setting was another cherry on a great cake. Go, check it, back it.<br/>The third game I backed is <b>Quickstarter: Harder They Fall</b> by James Illes. On the one hand, Legacy as a game and as a Kickstarter was an excellent experience. On the other hand, I do really like the idea as presented in the the description and am curious. If you are curious as well, hurry up, it only has a few days left.<br/>Next to those projects I am pondering to back the 2nd edition of <b>Over the Edge</b>. The setting is interesting, Urban Fantasy right up my ally and the system seems worth having a look, alas my resources are finite and thus am hestitating. Same goes for the <b>TERA DICE</b> dice set. It looks mighty cool and fancy\u2026 and everytime I ponder to maybe do drop the buck required.<br/>Yet, the other games are quite nice as well. <b>Esoterica</b> is a new urban fantasy game with some horror elements that does look interesting and utilizes the \u201eproven\u201c d6 system. <b>Flotsam</b> is a gm-less games for those who actually liked the B5 episode \u201eA view from the gallery\u201c and wished to play those folks. If you yearn for another PbtA game <b>Interstitial</b> got you covered with an interesting premise.<br/>Among the card-based systems <b>Zombie World</b> appears to be quite popular given the people I see who backed it and <b>Tales of Arcana</b> offers a nice card based character creation system. If you prefer d20 systems, check out <b>Proficiency</b> and <b>Frey</b>. I considered Proficiencey once and got Frey starred.<br/>If you like game books, <b>Samurai Slasher</b> looks cool, though it is already on the clock. The supplement <b>Animal Adventures</b> will supplement dogs to your game and if you play Delta Green you might like to have a look at <b>The Labyrinth</b>. I did like the cover of the D&amp;D supplement <b>Careless Adventurer\u2019s Guide</b>. Well, and if you are a book-o-phile check out the lavishly designed, hand-crafted <b>Cthulhu based Spell Book</b>.<br/>You\u2019ll find plenty more cool projects in the collection, see for yourself:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Urban Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Story Game Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Card-based Role-Playing Games<br/>3 d20 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Gamebooks<br/>3 Supplements<br/>3 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>2 Settings<br/>3 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>4 Dice Accessoires<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>3 Map Projects<br/>5 Various RPG Projects<br/>3 RPG-related Games<br/>1 Larp/Theater Project<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Portuguese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 RPG Community<br/><br/>Article: <b><a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/19/crowdfunding-collection-80/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/07/19/crowdfunding-collection-80/</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475802/#Comment_475802" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-29T18:06:39+00:00" title="July 29, 2018  6:06PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/07/29/crowdfunding-collection-81/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no 81, including every tabletop project started between 07.19 and 07.29.</a><br/><br/>Given that I am on the jump travelling to the US, to GenCon, I will keep the preface really short.<br/>In regards of the English project, <b>The Expanse</b> stood out as being the biggest IP.
