I could only make it Sunday.  I got some great description of how play works in A Wicked Age and that was interesting.   I met the A Wicked Age designer, who was a really mellow guy carrying his kid around in a mellow way.  Very nice guy.   We didn't talk too much about the game, but it was nice to meet him anyway.   He responded positively to my idea of using A Wicked Age as a basis for a Social Combat system, so based on that and other conversation it sounds feasible for my homebrew.   I haven't tried it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then attended the Game Design Panel, hosted by Luke Crane, and Fred Hicks.   Really fun, really great.  High energy, lots of enthusiasm, and hard-knuckle questions.  About six people including yours truly talked about their games and got feedback from the group.  The entire thing was awesome.   It was podcasted so you should be able to catch it online sometime.  Then I had to bug out to get home.   So short report.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122459/#Comment_122459" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T14:32:04+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  2:32PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I played<i>Phyrang</i>and got to be the color blue for fourteen straight hours</blockquote>\nWhat's Phyrang and why did you spend fourteen hours playing it?!?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122465/#Comment_122465" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T14:40:19+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  2:40PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 2:44PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>What's Phyrang and why did you spend fourteen hours playing it?!?</blockquote>\nYou know, <i>Phyrang,</i> the new CRN Hasbro division thing Clinton's genius daughters designed where you play colors and resolve Mansell-Aniki Principle conflicts by taking drugs.

It reminded me of way back at the turn of the century, where I got to ran the game that eventually made me the king of pimps and coke, <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/projects/misspent-youth/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a>, three times. Sure, the history books all talk about it now, but back then it was hard to see that I would be sleeping on beds of gold bullion (not very comfortable, but one suffers for one's station in life).<br/><br/>Anyway, it ran three times very well, full sessions. In fact it was that weekend that the game that would eventually be used to end the Arab/Israeli conflict was first played to a complete session. People were very happy with it, and when I thought there was maybe a problem, they told me I was stupid and the game went well at the Indie Game Designer Roundtable on Sunday.<br/><br/>I also got to play in an early playtest of Beowulf (marred slightly by our lack of having read the book fully), Spirit of the Century: Rex Rich and the Warlord of Mars (the only problem being I wanted to be able to interact more), a world creation session for shock:, an Escape or Die! game that made me unable to sleep until 4 am, an utterly grim session of Burning Empires: No Exit, and a content-controversial 1001 Nights game.<br/><br/>There may be others that I'm so dickish I forgot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

For me, the highlights were (finally) getting to play Shock:, a session of Steal Away Jordan that it still makes me kinda sad to think about, the story of the Sober Christian and the Shepherd Who Bared His Ass at Court during 1001 Nights, and a phenomenally righteous session of Misspent Youth (I'm the probably-slightly-too-intense guy who gushed to Rob about how awesome the losing was after the roundtable and may, just may, have looked like I was about to headbutt him if he changed anything about the game).  Even the stuff that didn't stand out as much as these, it was just a matter of the competition.  It was the intensity and energy level of the table when we had everyone utterly committed to the story that was a revelation to me, more than anything.  I often felt like I was one of the folks bringing the least to the table, but in a way that made me want to strive to excel and match everyone else's contribution, not in an "oh woe is me" way. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, everyone I met was wonderfully friendly, and so I had about as much fun away from the tables as at them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to everyone I played with.

I feel like complete crap today.<br/><br/>I gamed with 35 folks, some more than once, over 9 sessions.  That is probably a third of who I wished I could have gamed with at Dreamation.<br/><br/>I played in several playtests -- in fact, only two of the games I played in weren't.  While there were lots of other games out there, I gravitated towards playtests because I like 'em.  I suspect next year I'll try to play some games I haven't had a chance to, though, like (to "randomly" pick two) With Great Power... and Shock:.  Specifically, I run one session of Don't Rest Your Head, with full-on character creation, and two playtests of A Penny For My Thoughts, with interesting bits of data from both.  I think the experience that blew me the most away was a playtest jeepform game, Night of Nights, and the indie design panel.<br/><br/>Speaking of that...thanks to the infectious nature of the indie design panel and my own hubris, my balls are on the chopping block (if you will) to get a playtest of Damned Anonymous done by Dreamation 81.<br/><br/>The quality of the people there was just too amazing.  Wow.  I will have to make this an annual thing, now.  It beat out GenCon for Awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122623/#Comment_122623" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T04:32:07+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  4:32AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2008 5:28AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chadu</cite>Dude, did I hear right?

I met the guy who did the work, one of those quiet Kuiper belt types.<br/><br/>I ran or facilitated three playtests of three different games and a game of Grey Ranks.  Some scheduling snafus, as Joshua has already noted, resulted in some enterprising creativity.  I had six people signed up for Grey Ranks, so we built a single crew and then divided into two groups of three, switching a character (and player) between Chapters.  This worked great and was really fun.  The next day, our Food Holes playtest was overbooked by 100%, so Remi and I did the same thing, and again, it worked wonderfully.  Food Holes proved pretty solid, and we're set on a path now regarding the hack.  That feels good.  I again facilitated a test of Business Solutions, which went well but reinforced some lingering concerns that will send me back for more tinkering.  It isn't perfect!  I want it to be perfect.  And finally Kevin and I ran Project Bearclaw, which we played into - and beyond - complete failure.  We learned a lot, and our testers were very gracious with their time and feedback, and we both see a way forward, so that's pure gold.  <br/><br/>Other than that I did some improv to warm up Thursday night and then played two jeepform games, which I talk about elsewhere around here.

With echoes of the civil war and a nun with 6 shooters.<br/><br/>3) Cold Sleep - The crew of a deep space colonization ship awake from cryo sleep to find that the ships psychologist is dead but still inside the AI, the janitor is possessed by a weird alien signal from the planet ahead, and their dreams are becoming a shared space.  With deep rumblings about both losing and seeking faith (the two scientists), love and being really alone in the galaxy, and a creepy quartermaster receiving signals from another ship following them.<br/><br/>I'd so watch any of those if they were on TV.<br/><br/>I got to play Escape or Die! and learned to love yelling "doom" every 5 minutes or so.

Had to. <br/><br/>And let me tell you, reading IaWA on the Metro after a 2 hour brainexploding discussion at Chez Donoghue, after a 3 hour brainexploding drive back from NJ with Fred and Rob, after a 3 hour brainexploding Indie Roundtable (and the rest of brainexplodey Dreamation goodness)...<br/><br/>...I got home at midnight in a highly manic/creative state.

It was a good group of people, and folks really warmed up by the end. The closing montage (series of semi-related scenes) was tons of fun, with lots of great bits flying around. A bit exhausting, but good overall.<br/>\n<br/>\nInspectres - Man, this was a goofy blast with great people all-around (Rob Donoghue, Emily Care Boss, the wonderful Alexander Newman, with Nathan Paoletta running), and it was full-octane fun. I'd like to play again, even with the unconstrained Panic dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nEscape or Die! - Another fun, goofy game. There was some head-butting over narration, but overall the game hung together well and delivered on its promise of escape movie hijinks. My asshole rich guy bought it about halfway through, I can't even remember how. My favorite bit of narration was a hallucination that made a dead body into a zombie, only eyes and mouth moving. Creepy!<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday<br/>\nI slept through the Steal Away Jordan game I had signed up for. Sadness.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood Holes playtest - This was really fun, and I met and hung out with a bunch of people that I really like. The game went well, and is crawling towards 'ready for primetime'. No big shifts should happen other than re-naming some stuff. I really liked switching players around, and the big final rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nYARPG playtest - This is my Young Adult game, and will get its own post somewhere. Suffice to say this was a really tough game for me to run, as I knew it wasn't super-playable. I was super-nervous. Rob and Clyde gave me an hour and a half of feedback afterwards. Suffice to say I had two games glued to one another, and I'm planning on fixing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTicket To Ride - It only felt like a death march. Wish I had been able to summon conversation out of my sleep-deprived brain. Shane rightfully mocked me for saying I had played the game, while at the same time knowing nothing about its mechanics, set-up, or rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaturday<br/>\nWith Great Power - Man. The first half of this game was awesome. I wasn't crazy about the extended conflict at the end, as all the interesting interpersonal stuff went away and we just beat on the villains for what felt like forever. It was fun to play with Paul and Judd again, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nS7S Playtest - Joshua Newman, Lisa Padol, Mark Causey and I unknowingly conspired to break Chad's game with PvP play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPTA: Miniseries Event: This really is a 5-hour game, so it went until around 1:15. A huge group of people (8) in a small room. Half of them left at midnight to pursue other games, but the remaining players soldiered on to a satisfying conclusion. Not a  repeat of the fantastic game I had at Nerdly, but a good session, I thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Con I talked to a lot of people, but never really had the concentration to carry on a deep conversation. I swear, I'm capable of doing it! No idea what happened there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI left Sunday morning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122886/#Comment_122886" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T22:21:51+00:00" title="January 29, 2008 10:21PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did not win Dreamation, but I had an excellent time and posted my thoughts on it <a href="http://nemomeme.livejournal.com/5990.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122893/#Comment_122893" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-30T00:47:01+00:00" title="January 30, 2008 12:47AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite><br/>Ticket To Ride - It only felt like a death march.

We charged in the way we usually do: set up a bunch of protagonists who want important stuff from each other, then throw them in a pit (where "pit" is defined as "a situation where those desires are being expressed actively). We did that because we didn't know the rules. Had we known them, we'd have probably done some sort of party play.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that bar is strange.
