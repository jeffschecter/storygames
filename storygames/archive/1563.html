                    The thread "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1342" rel="nofollow">What you want to learn from people here</a>" produced some good stuff. So here's a follow-up. <br/><br/>I suggest mentioning about three people per post is about a good number. <br/><br/>I also urge you to <b>link to where you learned things from</b> so that everyone else can also learn.<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>* I've learned that theory can be clearly, interestingly, concretely, applicably, motivationally and <i>politely</i> explained from <a href="http://www.lumpley.com" rel="nofollow">Vincent</a>. (I know he's not here much.)<br/>* I've learned that die mechanics should "reinforce and emphasize" other aspects of the game from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1528&amp;page=1#Item_17" rel="nofollow">Dreampod</a>.<br/>* I've learned that a character sheet is a great place to start a game design from <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/reversed.html" rel="nofollow">Kevin Allen Jr.</a><br/><br/>You?                </div>

                            The things I've learned from people here have deeply shaped me as a designer and player. A few notable cases:<br/><br/>- I've learned that games can be pseudo-anthropological descriptions of non-existant cultures (from <b>Shreyas Sampat</b>, cf. every game he's ever written).<br/>- I've learned that rules do matter, but not as much as your working relationship with your fellow players (from <b>the Western Mass Crew</b>: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=8232.0" rel="nofollow">Adventures in Improvised System</a>).<br/>- I've learned that roleplaying can handle genres that are non-narrative, or narrative in non-traditional ways (from <b>Neel Krishnaswami</b>, <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html" rel="nofollow">Lexicon</a>).<br/>- I've learned that gender politics and issues of social empowerment make themselves known in rules, not just in setting and character (from <b>Mo Turkington</b>, <a href="http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/2006/01/push-vs-pull.html" rel="nofollow">Push vs. Pull</a>).<br/>- I've learned that play is made more awesome by listening to your fellow players and supporting them (from <b>Selene Tan</b>, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15144.0" rel="nofollow">Adventures in Ritual Language</a>).<br/>- I've learned that roleplaying is ultimately about the relationship between the players, projected onto the relationship between the characters or other game content (from <b>Emily Care Boss</b>, cf. every game she's ever written).<br/>- I've learned that, together, we can create beautiful &amp; terrible things that would have been impossible on our own (from <b>all the people</b> who worked on <a href="http://plays-well.org/push" rel="nofollow">Push vol 1</a>; and from <b>Thomas Robertson, Shreyas Sampat, &amp; Selene Tan</b>'s work on <a href="">the Four Nations project</a>).<br/>- I've learned that being able to communicate with your audience clearly and powerfully is worth its weight in gold (from <b>Vincent Baker</b>, cf. Dogs in the Vineyard, Theory: Hardcore, anyway)<br/>- I've learned that being in love with what you're doing and putting your whole heart into your work is pure, unadulterated awesome (from <b>Luke Crane</b>, cf. seeing the dude in action)<br/>- I've learned that a guy with a cool idea can make a community devoted to producing more cool ideas (from <b>Clinton R. Nixon, Ron Edwards, &amp; Andy Kitkowski</b> cf. the Forge and Story Games).                        </div>

<p>Holy crap, I hardly know where to begin.  I think I'm going to avoid the big names.  Mostly because I think that most everyone here knows that Ron, Vincent, and Luke, and a host of other big thinkers have taught us all quite a bit, and I think everyone really knows where to find that stuff.  So, lemmie focus on a short list of the most important things that I've learned from people that you may not have expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've learned from <strong>Jason Morningstar</strong> how to enjoy a GM-less game about copy repairmen.</li>
<li>I've learned from <strong>Remi Treuer</strong> how to make someone else awesome by stabbing myself in the eye.  And how to love it.</li>
<li>I've learned from all the awesome folks who came by my tables at conventions just how to refine a game presentation into just a few minutes time, how to really get right to the point of awesome every time, and how rediculously cool it can be to play a story game with half a dozen people you've never met before in your life.</li>
</ul>
