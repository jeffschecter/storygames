It was supposed to be a quick, in-and-out type of thing.  I didn\u2019t mean for things to turn out the way they did.  Not that I\u2019m making excuses, I\u2019m just saying.  I don\u2019t know how I even got the balls to do what I did; I\u2019m a burglar, not a\u2026 Well, I dunno.  I guess I saw the opportunity and seized it.</i><br/><br/>In The Oldest, Cruelest Sword, you have a opportunistic Thief, an reclusive Sorceress, and a very opinionated magic Sword.  Is this a recipe for adventure, or sexual assault (or maybe both)?  As you play, you\u2019ll find out.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/tocs/" rel="nofollow">miserytourism.com/tocs/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397298/#Comment_397298" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T01:43:29+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  1:43AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting - how does it play?<br/><br/>Some random ideas, not necessarily coherent or designed to work together<br/><br/> When thief uses stealth, he must describe a subset of the rooms features only, but my only move to an adjacent room, but when he doest use stealth, he must describe the room using all of its features, but .. oh I dont know, gets to move two spaces in a turn?<br/><br/>traps - need traps?  maybe one or more of the features of a room could be a trap, and if that feature is mentioned, it means the thief activated the trap.<br/><br/>should the sorceress move, or should she stay hidden and send minions to do her bidding?<br/><br/>the rape:  so its random?  if the paths cross it happens?  That seems disjointed to me - kind of tacked on.  There doesnt seem to be anything about the preceding play that leads to the possibility of a rape instigated by either party, or a consensual sexual encounter for that matter, nor for any player choice abut the matter.<br/><br/>Can you give an example of how the swords player can accomplish its agenda through play?  Maybe that is what Im missng.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FetusCommander" title="FetusCommander"><img alt="FetusCommander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FetusCommander">FetusCommander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397339/#Comment_397339" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T10:19:35+00:00" title="November 13, 2012 10:19AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Steve<br/><br/>I wish I still had the actual play me, Will and Mike recorded a long time ago, but I've lost it.  If I can find it, i'll upload it so you (and anyone else interested) can see the game in action.<br/><br/>I definitely like the traps, that's a damn good idea that i'll probably implement.<br/><br/>As for the rape, it isn't completely random.  The manual doesn't do a very good job of expanding on this, but basically, the Sword's player's agenda is their own (as in, the player's own).  The Sword's player can interject themselves into the other players Monologues, and even "get inside their head" by whispering directions to the player.  The Sword could, for example, tell the Thief to go South, knowing a collision with the Sorceress is imminent.  It could also do the same with the Sorceress in order to protect her from the rape endgame scenario.  Therefore, it's really important that the players wager, through their dialog with it, whether the Sword has their best interests in mind.  The game is really supposed to be built around the ambiguity of what the Sword represents within the other character's minds- how "in control" they are vs. how in control the Sword is.<br/><br/>In reference to the lack of "lead up" to the rape, I guess there really isn't any.  That's sort of the point though.  It's a seemingly disconnected crime that happens during the course of another crime (an opportunity rape). The players are basically playing knowing it's going to happen, and rationalizing it as they go (and really, after the fact: that's why there's an epilogue afterwards).<br/><br/>Does that sort of address your question?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397357/#Comment_397357" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T12:19:22+00:00" title="November 13, 2012 12:19PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was reading this game and it looked cool and interesting, and then I got to the totally pointless rape bit.
