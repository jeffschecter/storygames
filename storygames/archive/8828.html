I watch The Sarah Connor Chronicles devoutly, eating up every episode and yelling for more.  I am eagerly awaiting Terminator: Salvation.  When I was much younger, I watched &amp; rewatched Terminator 2 so many times -- it was clearly my favorite movie.<br/><br/>Holy crap, I loves me the story of Sarah &amp; John Connor.<br/><br/>So, I totally want a game that lets me play out the story of the Human Resistance.  But, like, there are core truths I wouldn't want to violate -- namely that the humans lose.  It's important to me that the humans eventually win against Skynet, because otherwise it invalidates the core idea of the franchise and thus, meh, it's not what I want.<br/><br/>But if that can't be "at risk," then what's the game fucking about?  I was thinking about that today, reflecting on the amazing TPK game detailed in another thread, and realized that we were playing out a human drama set to events we as players knew would Go Bad.  What if instead of the players embracing a truth of ultimate failure, it was a truth of ultimate success?  That doesn't make it any less of a human drama, because a victory over Skynet is paid for by the lives of good people and the hardening of kind souls.<br/><br/>I'm contemplating "re-skinning" Grey Ranks for this, partly because that old adage of "GMs runs the games they want to play in" is so true here, so why not take a GMless game for it?  And because the reason Terminator is so powerful for me is because of the individuals involved and how they change due to knowledge of the future -- in other words, human drama, not "dude, check out that liquid metal guy!"  (Though, dude, check out that liquid metal guy!)  It would take a different arc, one that's more depressing in the beginning and more hopeful (or at least daring) in the end.<br/><br/>I just thought of this idea like an hour or so ago, so it's not really fleshed out in my mind.  But I got to thinking:  hey, there some people here who like the same sort of thing!  For y'all, what would you consider in re-skinning Grey Ranks?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196444/#Comment_196444" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T13:50:22+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  1:50PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why didn't this post get more love? Crazy!<br/><br/>I've also been looking at reskinning GR, for one game about superheroes balancing ordinary lives and another game reworking my favorite parts of <i>Cybergeneration</i>.<br/><br/>For Cybergeneration, you've got GMless, mission-based play and more player-generated personal scenes: ace. You've got an easy equivalent of Radio Lightning in net feeds. Writing up the grid stories is enjoyable (bit of fun pre-play there). And the axes pretty much work as is, assuming you want a relatively dark revolution story.<br/><br/>For the superhero game, I was thinking about changing the axes considerably - Famous &lt;&gt; Quiet Life and Power Mad &lt;&gt; Hesitant. There's some peculiar setting material I'd need to work on first, to get a real handle on the world.<br/><br/>A Terminator variant would absolutely work, and I don't know if GR would even need many changes. I'd maybe turn Radio Lightning into 'messages from the front', delivered by walking wounded and dead drop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196455/#Comment_196455" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T14:37:27+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  2:37PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>A Terminator variant would absolutely work, and I don't know if GR would even need many changes.

There are bits where John Connor is speaking into something and at one point says "This is John Connor.  If you're listening to this, you're the resistance."  After my total fanboyism at that, I thought that would be a kick-ass way to end each Radio Lightning-type bit.<br/><br/>Your setting axes for Cybergeneration (which I'm unfamiliar with) sounds pretty awesome.  I hadn't thought about changing those up, mainly since I was still setting this in a war.  But, as you said, probably doesn't need that many changes.<br/><br/>Another thing to consider, and I hadn't thought about this until now: the game could have a very different feel of you change the number of chapters.  Obvious to some, I'm sure, but I only realized that now.<br/><br/>Thanks for giving this some love, Joe!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196530/#Comment_196530" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-11T06:52:27+00:00" title="March 11, 2009  6:52AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got your back, Ryan.

I'm not sure how to tweak that, but I do think that restricting the resistance PCs to only teenagers would be (in this case, not in GR!) a copout.  But the vibe that teenaged drama has was powerful, and I wonder if being "too adult" would end up making it too easy on the players -- that whole "this is a hard world and we've been made hard adults by it" thing that could easily deflate some of that interpersonal tension.<br/><br/>Though, it could be a case where judicious use of language to keep the feel going.

To say that a German soldier shoots a kid is vile -- we accept that horror overall less than "a German soldier shoots an adult."  In a sense, I think in playing the game we respect that enough to keep adult-on-kid violence to a minimum.  But to say that a machine shoots a kid is, well, understandable in that "it's a machine, it doesn't care" sort of way.  So, that sense of immortality of youth &amp; false protection that "being under 18" gives isn't valid in this setting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Reversing the grid so that the corners were positive is interesting and could totally work.</blockquote>\nNow you've got me thinking about reskinning* the corners -- not necessarily as positives, but to highlight the idea that these are the little costs (or "toll") of a human victory.  Maybe less "this is what you experience" and more "this is what people will say about you when they tell your story to their children."<br/><br/>(*I now realize that saying "reskinning" here is a pun!

He's the banner under which they all fly.  He's the commander-in-chief of a resistance network that goes beyond a single nation.  I'm also going to love seeing someone destroy the symbol of their utter trust &amp; faith in Connor -- man, that will be sweet.<br/><br/>But along with that, I'm going to have what I call the "John Connor Rule" -- that is, he may not appear in the game (beyond the resistance broadcasts that are a replacement for Radio Lightning).  He's a nigh-mythical figure who is closed off to many for his own protection.  It's enough for people to say "Connor said we need to secure this point," not just constantly having him come in and say it.  I think that'll also reinforce the sense I want of average resistance fighters here.<br/><br/>Man, the more I think about this, the more I want to play it right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196953/#Comment_196953" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-14T15:32:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2009  3:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a cool, mythic touch, Ryan.
