Often including a player who narrates the fictional world and many other characters.<br/><br/>Story game<br/>A form of narration game with rules that focus on the telling of a story. <br/><br/>So I would define the games we play primarily as narration games, narration is their defining feature. We narrate and that narration has some effect on the game state. Note that Narration game is a very broad category including things that are not story games or rpgs, games like dixit also fall into this category.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354586/#Comment_354586" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T04:36:52+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  4:36AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty close to my take.

A narrator is a different thing than an actor.<br/><br/>game = structured play<br/><br/>game ( talking game ( role-playing game ( story game ) ) )<br/><br/>I put story games as a subset of role-playing games. On the other hand storytelling games (where players tell a story without ever role-playing) would be on the same level as role-playing games, not a subset.<br/><br/>I also wouldn't limit the definition of role-playing to require any kind of character monogamy. If I play a different character every ten minutes, I'm still role-playing. As you mention, the GM plays lots and lots of charaters but is still role-playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354587/#Comment_354587" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T04:48:12+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  4:48AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish the term story game would die an ignominious death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354589/#Comment_354589" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T04:55:55+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  4:55AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I quite like the term story game but I'm not going to define it.

It was after yet another discussion on RPGNet back in the day where this discussion was popularized nearly monthly, "X (game from some Forge developer) is NOT an RPG!" <br/><br/>The very topic at the time that set the ball rolling was this: "My Life With Master is <b>NOT</b> an RPG because it has an endgame condition. Role-playing games by necessity (and apparently definition) open-ended." There were more games from that year disparaged as not RPGs because they had these endgame conditions or rules on "what you feel/think" (nuh-uh, no game is gonna dictate to me what my character thinks!), a stable of characters and not just one, and on and on. But mostly it was the endgame thing that kind of set us off a bit, particularly Clinton. Because any way you slice it, MLWM is a fucking role-playing game. Might not be as contentious a stance now, but a few years ago it was.<br/><br/>Two things happened from that discussion:<br/><br/>1) My definition of Role-Playing Game solidified in my mind, and became the standard for what I do and do not think of as an RPG. "Do you PLAY a ROLE? Then it's a ROLE PLAYING GAME." (usually using the word "fucking" in each of those sentences)<br/><br/>Interestingly enough: By this definition, unless you drift Universalis, Universalis isn't a role-playing game (unless you squint, because you really don't play a role all that much), which is a stance I later discovered that Ralph and Mike (the designers) had been yelling in people's faces since day one! :-)<br/><br/>2) Clinton posted some eye-rolling post on the blog he was using at the time, basically throwing up his hands at this idiocy, saying basically (in intent, not literally), "Alright. Fuck it, let's just call them "story games" instead." <br/><br/>(I registered the domain that afternoon! Was actually considering using it as a gaming imprint/ "company" until the idea to make a forum came along, and here we are)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>My gamey definition of Story Games as a thing, I think I put it on the wiki, "Games where we focus more on the story and less on 'my guy'." You can of course aim to do that with traditional RPGs. It's simple: Create a stable of characters instead of Everyone Gets One (whom they play exclusively forever). Boom, that's instant story game.<br/><br/>But that definition covered under an umbrella games with multiple characters, scene-framing, endgame conditions, etc etc etc. The thought there was that you're still "playing a role", so I haven't gone at it like a Neoplatanist philosopher, grouping scrolls into bins and carefully drawing lines in the sand of what does and doesn't make it in.<br/><br/>Pragmatically, though, it's a great term: If you say "Anyone want to meet up for some story games?" You will get folks turning up expecting some game like Fiasco, Microscope, Primetime Adventures, etc. If you say "Anyone want to meet up for some RPGs?" You'll have to give a long list of what you do and do not mean by that, so that the guy turning up expecting D&amp;D or Shadowrun (and whose interests lie no where near what we talk about here) won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Beyond that... \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>You're a better man than<a href="http://www.postmoderntherapy.com/Wittgenstein/lw65-69c.htm" rel="nofollow">Wittegenstein</a>if you can.</blockquote>\n"Better" isn't the word I'd use. :-)<br/><br/>If you spend all your time negotiating the definition of Story Game, what it ontologically means, and what necessarily does and does not qualify, check out Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus ("Early Wittgenstein").<br/><br/>If you are cool with the blob of crap that story games can mean, but especially in what socially the term is used for, then check out Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations ("Late Wittgenstein").<br/><br/>I've read both; if you know me, you know where I stand. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354622/#Comment_354622" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T07:11:30+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  7:11AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 7:11AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>The name comes last.</blockquote>\nYeah but look at all the fun that's come out of someone sticking the placeholder term "role-playing game" on D&amp;D early on...<br/>Yeah, but I'll bet they played a lot of Braunstein and Blackmoor and proto-D&amp;D before anyone said the world "role-playing".*<br/><br/>* not an actual bet.

The short version is that it conveys a very important prioritization: we are going to make a (singular) story. We are making it together. Your personal creative turf (a character) is less important than the shared turf (our story).<br/><br/>Compare that to traditional RPGs where you could show up with a <i>character you made all on your lonesome</i>. To play in an adventure the GM made without <i>any knowledge of who the characters would be</i>. That's a physical impossibility in the kind of games I'm talking about. That's a huge shift in attitude.<br/><br/>And to the other audience that has played no RPGs, they know what story means.

I might also include things like My Life with Master here, because even though the characters can choose to do all sorts of things, the goal is to play out a specific kind of experience.<br/><br/> <b>Sandbox games</b>, including other veins of D&amp;D, Shadowrun, White Wolf stuff, Apocalypse World, Freemarket, etc. Also GM-driven.<br/><br/><b>GM-less/ful games</b>, since this tradition is still in the early stages, so we can combine things like Polaris and Fiasco together, even though they're way different. There's probably also some veins of D&amp;D that fit in this category too, like online freeform GM-ful D&amp;D or, like, when kids attempt to "play D&amp;D" during a roadtrip in the car, just by themselves with no materials.<br/><br/>Are there others?  Maybe.  The thing with "story games" is that it's often used as a stand-in for "indie games and games that indie games people like," which isn't descriptive of the type of games, really, just the community of people and the games they happen to play. Practically at the table, Apocalypse World has a lot more in common with Vampire than it does with Fiasco, even though AW+Fiasco have supposedly come out of the same community of design and play.  They perhaps share a common perspective on game design, but that doesn't necessarily translate into games that are at all similar in practice.<br/><br/>"Indie games" is not a type of games, necessarily, and the shared similarities in design -- due to mutual influence -- have waned in the past few years as the community has grown larger, more diverse, and more confident in expressing a diverse range of design and play interests.  This is only going to continue, even with big impact games like AW and Fiasco spreading certain ideas across the design landscape.<br/><br/>Honestly, the thing that people who play "story games" or "indie games" have most in common, in my experience, is their desire to play a whole bunch of different kinds of games and their drive to try new things.  I feel like you draw the same crowd to meetups by organizing them as opportunities to try out new games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354643/#Comment_354643" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T08:03:22+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  8:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see what you're after there, Ross, and it makes sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354644/#Comment_354644" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T08:03:29+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  8:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 8:04AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>we can usefully think of it as a term of identity or a rallying point.</blockquote>\nI like where this is going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354645/#Comment_354645" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T08:06:17+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  8:06AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            guys guys, a name is chosen for a purpose. <br/><br/>what is the purpose here?<br/><br/>is the purpose academic classification?

Certainly Ross explained how he's using the term, which is different form how I am using the term. I'm approaching it as a publisher, really. What I wrote to Ross elsewhere on this issue:<br/><br/>"My feeling is that someone going "Huh, I wonder what kind of game this is" is a net win, and "Huh, a story game" is a net loss, because the term is either interesting already or needlessly confusing, or actively repellant for reasons related to dumb identity politics, or obvious to the micro-genre fans who know what it is anyway. Everyone likes games; if you tell them it is a game you will get it in their hands and they will see that it is, as promised, a game. That's how I feel and I use the broadest possible definition when describing my own ... games!"<br/><br/>So that's reasoning that 100% does not apply to community-builders. It'd be nice if there was a really good term everybody could use but there isn't. Watching "story game" transform from the broadest possible definition to a handful of narrow ones over a few years has been fascinating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_354650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354650/#Comment_354650" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T08:16:32+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  8:16AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2012 8:20AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>I disagree entirely.

She portrays several NPCs as part of her set of leader-tools, to make the players enjoy their avatars the more, and help them into the game.<br/><br/>There's a paradox, of course: <br/>- saying that the GM is just another player is true ... <br/>- but then it's untrue too; the GM is anything but a player.<br/>In many ways the GM is a tool in the hands of the designer, an agent for a force outside the player group; a betrayer!<br/><br/>And you have to take into consideration that a lot of different role-playing games has seen the light of day since D&amp;D; and a lot of them comes with no GM in them (see thread: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15621&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Games classical and modern</a>). The great majority of rpg-fans are <i>players</i>, and they focus on how their particular single character fares in the overall narrative. The game hinges on character-portrayal and functionality.<br/><br/>Whereas in a story-game the players are all focusing on the story; building a cool narrative is far more important than immersing yourself in a single character. The methods are geared towards story-telling, not character-portrayal.

B/X puts the emphasis on exploring and discovering an unfamiliar environment, obtaining treasure, and preferably<i>avoiding</i>combat. But that, in some ways, is also an evolution of the pre-D&amp;D wargaming culture (The Mule Abides has a good blog post about that).<br/>(Just as an interesting point here, Call of Cthulhu takes the old-school into the mystery genre by having the players explore a prepared unfamiliar set of relationships, instead of an environment).<br/><br/>Also: The game of character-building was an emergent property of the advancement system of levels in early D&amp;D, and has become a major part of the game since 2nd edition. But it's by no means universal to all of D&amp;D.

I'll lay out the party line (meaning, how Forge theory defines some things):<br/><br/>Numero uno, to even discuss things like terminology you basically need to accept certain postmodern tools to even be comprehensible: there is a need to understand that words by themselves do not have objective definitions, but rather language is a social construct - words mean what we agree upon for them to mean. Often this social coordination of communication becomes an authority struggle: you can show your loyalty to a given tribe by the way you use words, and you can display your authority by influencing others to use words your way.<br/><br/>Furthermore, even if we're all being egalitarian and objective, with no tribalist bullshit getting in the way, there's still the issue of useful frameworks of thought: people use words for different purposes, and for this reason they have different needs for what those words mean. This is easy to see everywhere around us: words are constantly being repurposed to make them more useful for different situations. The important lesson here is that it's wrong to ask what a word "means". The useful question is, which framework of thought is most useful for my purposes in this situation, and therefore, what do I want words to mean?<br/><br/>Basically all discussions about rpg terminology in the Internet become such clusterfucks because of those two issues: on the one hand we have people fighting to brand "roleplaying" as a term according to their own wishes on what to include or exclude, and then on the other hand we have people who actually need to use words to think, and they're obviously trying to find words for concepts of utility.<br/><br/>Now that we understand the inherent arbitrariness of terminology, the substantial issue: when we ask "What is roleplaying?", what is usually really being asked is "Where are the boundaries of this interesting thing of ours?" I actually gave a lecture on this in 2004-ish at Ropecon, where I outlined some of the basic interests people have in the concept of roleplaying. The point of my lecture was that different subcultures use the term in different ways simply because their interests are different, and therefore they do not need or want to use the word in the sense other, contrary subcultures use it. For examples, consider:<ul><li>What I like to call "traditional" roleplaying from the late '80s and '90s involves a strong core of gamers who know what they like in gaming. They have a vested interest in defining "roleplaying game" in ways that emphasize their interests. I've heard such traditional gamers claim that a roleplaying game is a game that has an all-powerful GM, for example. Another common requirement is that each player has to take the role of a fictional character and play the game from in-character viewpoint. Furthermore, the task of the GM is to provide content for the other players to interact with, while the players form a party that resolves challenges posited by the GM. From outside the subculture it's obvious that this is a historically organic, essentially conservative and non-analytic definition: "roleplaying is the shared properties of the games this gaming culture of ours has spawned", one might say. It's an entirely valid way of defining roleplaying, I have only sympathy for anybody who feels that games that lack these traditional features have lost what made them interesting for the traditionalist: he has his hobby with its received wisdom, and the label on that hobby is "roleplaying", so of course he's going to be upset if the same word is being painted on stuff that he's not interested in.</li><li>Nordic freeform rpg culture shares an almost universal model for what roleplaying is: roleplaying is a practice where participants pretend to experience fictional subject matter (events, feelings, etc.). This is (or was) a radical off-shoot of the mainstream of roleplaying culture, one where people pushed the boundaries and abandoned many of the traditional elements of the roleplaying game. For example, game-like mechanics were largely abandoned. The motivation in this subculture is experiental, as I understand it: people like to play because they enjoy the flow experience that humans can induce by using their imagination in a concerted manner. "Roleplaying" here is often literally "playing a role", meaning "immersing in a fictional character", or a bit more widely simply "immersing in a fiction". I've met Nordic theorists who will quite clearly argue that games like computer roleplaying games or even just particularly compelling novels may encourage an activity that is indistinguishable from roleplaying.</li></ul>\nThe wise observer will probably notice that there is nothing inherently wrong with either of the above subcultures and their ways of thinking. They're just using the same or similar terminology in different ways because their interests and concerns are fundamentally different. Both types of roleplayers can point to examples of their practice that are clearly roleplaying games in their opinion while falling solidly outside the frame for the other subculture. It would not be useful for either to abandon terminology that they have genuinely developed through a historical process, starting from the same or similar starting points. Of course it would make an armchair theorist happy if eg. traditionalists continued using the term (they have a pretty strong historical affinity to it, after all) while Nordic freeformers and other such off-shoot subcultures started calling their hobby something else. It's just interesting to ask - why should we care about some armchair theorist in the real world?<br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to share the definition of roleplaying that I've found the most useful myself. It's the one utilized in the Big Model of Forgean rpg theory, and I prefer it because it focuses on roleplaying as a social, purposeful activity, which I think is the core of roleplaying in comparison to some other arts. Because the model reflects my understanding of roleplaying well, I like thinking of roleplaying in its terms.<br/><br/>So, the Big Model claim is simple: roleplaying is the practice of Exploring Shared Imagined Space, and a roleplaying game is a game where exploring the SIS is a necessary practice. When you see a game and wonder whether it's a roleplaying game, the question is simple: is there a Shared Imagined Space, and is it being Explored? Insofar as such exploration is incidental we may say that a game involves roleplaying; where exploring the SIS is central and necessary we may very properly say that the game in question is a roleplaying game. What then, is the Shared Imagined Space? This is also simple: the SIS is the conceptual virtual space we discuss and describe in the process of roleplaying. I often use the Star Trek holodeck as a comparison: the players have the ability to conjure up imaginary spaces, objects, events and even people in their imaginary holodeck, which we call the Shared Imagined Space. Where such is present, the chance of roleplaying (exploration) occurring is rather high.<br/><br/>It's notable that I couldn't care a flying fig about whether the above thing is called "roleplaying"; the important thing from my viewpoint is that the conceptual space limited by the above definition is the space where the interesting, "roleplaying-like" stuff happens insofar as I'm concerned. It's also interesting to compare the Big Model theoretical structure with other definitions of roleplaying, such as the two I outlined above, as it again allows us to see how there's a large bit of overlap between the notions, but also clear swathes of areas where the definitions differ. A traditionalist or Nordic immersionist, for example, might consider a Fighting Fantasy book to be essentially a roleplaying game, while the Big Model would not, as there is no Shared Imagined Space present. Similarly, neither the traditionalist nor immersionist would count things like Universalis or Microscope roleplaying games, while from the viewpoint of the Big Model its differences from traditional roleplaying games are merely incidental technical details that do not impact its powerful core SIS.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>As for "Story Game", it's a marketing term with shallow history and little in the way of cultural backing. I use it on the cover of <i>Zombie Cinema</i> because I think that it captures the feel of the game well while seeming appealing and exact to people who don't know what it is. Just like "roleplaying", though, it's ultimately just an arbitrary word, and anybody who actually cares about what it means beyond the necessity of understanding what another person is saying should take a deep breath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354769/#Comment_354769" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T17:59:18+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  5:59PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite><br/>can anyone think of something something that is not what we consider a "roleplaying game" but still a game where the fiction is a part of the rules?</blockquote>\nI don't think this thought exercise is as helpful as "Is there anything we consider a roleplaying game where the fiction <b>isn't</b> a part of the rules?"<br/><br/>If we answer your question, Tyler, the definition just stares back at us and says, "but fiction's a part of the rules.

For example, in gaming circles I've seen for decades, it's pretty normal to say something like "hey, do want to role-play shopping for your new sword or just summarize it?" meaning should we speak in-character and play it out or not. Or "the game was okay, but there was a lot of combat and not a lot of role-playing." That seems like very common parlance to me.<br/><br/>I'm not rejecting Eero's definition of RPGs because of that, I'm just pointing out that the same word may have a different specific meaning within RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354777/#Comment_354777" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T18:51:56+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  6:51PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree that historically there is a pretty clear usage of the world "to roleplay" in the sense of describing/acting dialogue and action in character. In any context where I'd need to explain roleplaying as a historical cultural phenomenon, that sort of consideration would certainly play into it. It's just a different question from the theoretical and analytical "define roleplaying" thing. A prime example of how words obscure meaning, in fact, when the same word can and should be used in different ways when considering different issues.<br/><br/>I mean, it's entirely rational to say something like "for the purposes of game design we should define roleplaying on the basis of the tools it utilizes, because otherwise we're limiting ourselves unnecessarily in considering the possibilities". However, it's also equally rational to say that "for the purposes of historical analysis, we should use the term 'roleplaying' as the name for the historical cultural phenomenon that started with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and was named by its practitioners as exactly that" or "now that we're actually playing, I'm going to call in-character acting 'roleplaying' to differentiate it from tactical out-of-character discussions". All of these are sensible ways to use the word, insisting on a single definition is just inflexible thinking. It's like demanding that people stop calling a chicken sandwich "chicken hamburger". (Hmm, that simile doesn't translate too well; Finnish fast food restaurants call anything that has a bun a "hamburger" to the annoyance of the literal-minded.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_354792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354792/#Comment_354792" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T22:34:25+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 10:34PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>So, the Big Model claim is simple: roleplaying is the practice of Exploring Shared Imagined Space, and a roleplaying game is a game where exploring the SIS is a necessary practice.</blockquote>This is a nice one, as long as we understand the term "shared imagined space". It's important to see that the "shared imagined space" is not the fiction, but a basis for it, originating in the interaction of players. The shared space is the milestones by which we measure our fiction, and give it a direction that is in line with the fiction of the other players. <br/><br/>We, the players, do have a shared imagined space, and we do explore it, and the result is our individual, but related, fictions.<br/><br/>The designer present a <i>vision</i> (his game).<br/>The group of players engage in <i>interaction</i> (where we establish the shared imagined space, and explore it).<br/>The player leaves the table with his own, internal <i>fiction</i> (the rational and emotional product of the game and the interaction).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>lets define what rpgs and story games are! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15645/lets-define-what-rpgs-and-story-games-are/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="lets define what rpgs and story games are! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15645/lets-define-what-rpgs-and-story-games-are/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Andy&quot;Do you PLAY a ROLE?
