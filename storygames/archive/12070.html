I have a number of non-gamer friends, and well, I'd like to fix that. Especially since my gamer friends live in various states and countries that only have in common the fact that I'm not there, leading to far rarer in-person gaming than I'd like.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith that thought in mind, I started pondering what makes a good introduction to roleplaying games. My friends and I all mostly came in on Dungeons and Dragons or Vampire or what not, and I'm pretty sure that these are *not* how I want to introduce people who may have to be coaxed into the hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my question is what do folks think are good first time RPGs? As a bonus, I'd find any accounts of why that's so, and any information on successful RPG introductions as absolute gravy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270361/#Comment_270361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T11:08:03+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 11:08AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2010 11:12AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome, Jeff!<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7577" rel="nofollow">Here's a related thread</a>.<br/><br/>My answer from that thread: "A game you love that they are excited about! I don't think simplicity or genre familiarity are important at all. People are smart. If they are eager to try it, and you are eager to show it off, it will be great. I've played The Roach and Grey Ranks with people who have never played a roleplaying game and it has always gone well, because they were like "I want to try this!" and I was like "I love this game!"

I ordered Shab Al-Hiri roach a ways back, but I'm out of the country for a few months, so it's sitting patiently in my house waiting for me, and I'm excited. I don't have any trouble getting excited about a wide variety of games, I'm just hoping to be able to 'make the sale' as it were, and get other folks hooked in. All of this indie-game stuff I've gotten into recently has really encouraged me for knowing what to pitch about RPGs that normal, adult people enjoy without being as hard a core nerd as I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarknau,<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually just discovered Lady Blackbird this week! I heard it mentioned in Gregor Hutton's "Walking Eye" interview, was delighted to find out it was free, and was further excited by it and the other free offerings at John Harper's site (I already love Agon and am working on a Norse hack for it)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirefly is my favorite 'gateway drug' for nerdery. Everyone I've made sit down and watch it comes away raving, so I think that's actually a really good recommendation for my friends. Unfortunately, my friends vary on what aesthetics/et cetera they find more compelling, so I'm looking for one to apply to a critical mass of 3 or 4 folks. I had been thinking traditional fantasy is familiar and pretty easy to get buy in with, but westerns (weird or not) and now that you mention it, Firefly, are also tempting suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270366/#Comment_270366" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T11:28:04+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 11:28AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the successful introductions I've been doing through the last five years have used these games, primarily:\n<ul>\n<li><i>The Mountain Witch</i> is easy to learn and generally attracts both adults and teenagers - those who aren't captured by anime stylings will go for the Kurosawa-style serious depiction.</li>\n<li>Old-school, simplified-rules D&amp;D is surprisingly good as an introductory game. My experience with teenagers is that hitpoints is a tad too much, but class/level and ability scores are just right. Most importantly, the "GM is the window to the world" thing and clearly set fictional challenges and goals works to keep the game going.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/zombiecinema" rel="nofollow">Zombie Cinema</a> is my own newbie-portal design which relies on being quick to teach and quick to play, and boardgame-based insofar as the components and their use is concerned.

Many have a strong console-gaming background. Many are rather geeky but not gamers. Some are just plain "normals."<br/><br/>The pitch that seems to do the best for me is something like:<br/><br/>"We're going to make our own story here, like a move or TV show. You will each have an important, central character in the story that you are responsible for. I am going to be a sort of referee, keep things moving, and play background characters and stuff. Sometimes, we'll roll some dice to see what happens when you try to do something. Not always, but sometimes. We'll get some randomness that way, to inspire our imaginations. Also, sometimes that might make you fail at what you were trying to do, but that's OK. Sometimes a story is a lot more interesting when we fail. OK? Ready?" And then concrete, step-by-step stuff for a little while so they get the hang.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270369/#Comment_270369" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T11:42:46+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 11:42AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excuse me, but I'm a fanboy.  There, I said it upfront.<br/><br/>The Mountain Witch.<br/><br/>I sat there at the table, having played games for years, and was blown away by what happened.  And when I've run the game, even for new players, they come away excited.<br/><br/>It's so lite the rules can and should be taught as they happen.  It preserves a highly competitive state much like a board game.  The Fates demand and encourage personal investment in the character, as well as offer group authorship of the setting and narrative.<br/><br/>Newbie mistakes to avoid:  Don't try to encourage characters to get along.  <i>Players</i> should get along, in setting up their <i>characters</i> to "not" get along.  Always encourage and congratulate even the smallest betrayal.  Characters will be "forced" to cooperate "despite" their mistrust and Fate related issues, hence the game.<br/><br/>The game is still tasky.  "I want to kill the archer on the tower wall." gets broken down to "I want to cross the bridge; I want to scale the wall; I want to kill the archer."  Three actions, three rounds, three counter-stakes.  Abilities (like "Can shoot fire from his fist") are the only things that can change that.<br/><br/>Newbie advice that makes it flow way better:  Always, when the opportunity presents itself, do something oddly specific.  Always.  It gives all the other players something to build on.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>GM "Night begins to fall as you wind your way out of the forest and back to the path.  The snow is thick on the ground, but not so thick that you cannot see a small shrine where incense burns over an offering bowl."<br/><br/>Green "Hoichi kneels and offers a few coins, uttering a phrase in Cantonese."<br/>White "Izu places an orange flower against the shrine and says nothing."<br/>Blue "Hoichi, Izu, quite fooling around.  We have much to do."<br/><br/>Because later, when it's time to reveal Fates, it might be that orange flower that seals the deal.  <br/><br/>Blue "It was an orange flower left outside my master's bedroom the night he was murdered.  It was identical to the one you left at the shrine.  It was you, Izu, who betrayed me."<br/>Or perhaps <br/>Green "All of my dealings with the Witch have been in Cantonese.  All along I have warned him of your coming.  I have brought you all here as my part of the bargain.  Now see what he offered me in return."<br/><br/>All that aside, the discussion linked above by Jason has a ton of good games and advice.  Other than The Mountain Witch, I've personally had good experiences showing new people Kagematsu, The Shadow of Yesterday (if you avoid Bringing Down the Pain for at least three or four sessions), Dogs in the Vineyard, and Ganakagok.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270370/#Comment_270370" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T11:46:16+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 11:46AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As common (and hated) as it stands, the good old "Like cops and robbers, for grownups" works like a charm.<br/><br/>I introduced my (then) completely new to role-playing girlfriend with Breaking the Ice.

But more so!").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270378/#Comment_270378" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T12:19:42+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 12:19PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In A Wicked Age could be perfect for non-gamers--long-time gamers struggle to grok the non-stakes-setting play, while someone with no preconcepttions would probably pick it up in one full conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270387/#Comment_270387" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T14:27:26+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  2:27PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D is a good choice, so is old-school d6 Star Wars, for those of a certain age group for which Star Wars has undeniable cultural cachet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270391/#Comment_270391" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T15:24:17+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  3:24PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11681&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">A thread on running Dogs in the Vineyard for new players.</a><br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11593&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">And Mouse Guard for new players.</a><br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9825&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">And Ghost/Echo for a new player.</a><br/>(<a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ghostecho/" rel="nofollow">Ghost/Echo</a>, if you don't already know).<br/><br/>+1 on d6 Star Wars, especially for people who like Star Wars.

Can you finish a game of It's Complicated in two hours? If so, it's a winner.<br/><br/>D&amp;D fails on many levels. Fantasy is weird. Rules are fiddly and complicated. Takes too long to play. Chargen isn't immediately fun. Lots of weird dice.<br/>D6 Star Wars, too.<br/><br/>I think a lot of these games are simple as far as RPGs go, but if you're successful introducing your non-gamer friends to them, then they'll be gamers when you're done. That is, they're transition games; they're not role-playing games for non-gamers per se. I think transition games have a high risk of failure with non-gamers.<br/><br/>No one has mentioned Fiasco yet, right? Fiasco is an amazing game for non-gamers.

To me, those problems seem like a gamer's reaction to a ruleset with fewer points of contact (i.e., simple rules). Non-gamers aren't going to be flummoxed by freeform story-telling, because they already know how to tell stories. Non-gamers aren't going to have the expectation that they have "my guy" or that their guy should "win." That is, non-gamers don't have all the damned baggage that gamers have.<br/><br/>When I ran Fiasco recently, one of the players had almost no tabletop role-playing experience at all. Now, she did have a lot of MUSH role-playing experience, so I'm not sure I'd call her a non-gamer. Still the world of tabletop RPGs was totally alien to her and she approached Fiasco with a lot of trepidation -- and did just fine and had a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I really want to see if I can get my parents to play Fiasco with me some time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270730/#Comment_270730" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-11T15:51:36+00:00" title="May 11, 2010  3:51PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2010 3:52PM by John_Powell.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><br/>I haven't played Lady Blackbird, but from what I've read, it scores here, though I suspect it can't be played in two hours it's fandom-y (your friends have to like the Firefly series and such... which rules out my parents, but not my wife). </blockquote>\nI ran Lady Blackbird for a group of six 11 and 12 year-olds at my daughter's birthday party last summer.

I also realized that a lot of my worry about being 'adversarial' probably came from an assumption of a 'party' based game, since great friends try to beat the snot out of each other at everything from basketball to poker to scrabble *all the time* with no hard feelings. Like, when I first read In a Wicked Age, I worried that people would be hurt or offended by messing with each other, but from all the AP I've read about, it's the opposite - everybody has fun with that and doesn't get their panties in a bunch. I also just read through Fiasco (btw, great game Jason! I can't wait to play it!) and that really hammered home the difference between (player) collaboration and (character) cooperation, with the former being waaaaaaayyyy more important than the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271629/#Comment_271629" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T06:07:22+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  6:07AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zombie Cin\xe9ma can be very hard if you don't start with a good situation.
