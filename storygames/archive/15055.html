Halberd-wielding Edmund has affixed a torch to his polearm and is on point. The grade begins to grow muddy and the patrol has to make rolls to keep their footing. Edmund fails and begins to slide down the steep incline. Thinking quickly, he turns onto his back, using his shield like a sled. So, now he's flying down this incline backwards and upside down with his halberd in front of him like a lance and his torch sputtering as he gains speed.<br/><br/>The tunnel levels out and the halberd tip plants into the ground, extinguishing his torch and vaulting Edmund through the darkness who deftly rights himself as he flies through the air and lands in a defensive crouch with his shield raised towards the massive dark tunnel ahead. <br/><br/>The best part? When the patrol caught up with him, Edmund, being a sober, humble soldier didn't even mention it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342484/#Comment_342484" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T20:32:32+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  8:32PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monster of the Week (beta)<br/><br/>The team are standing in a motel room with salt and blood warding glyphs on all the doors and windows, a decapitated 7-foot demon on the floor, and buckets of demon blood (and a little human blood) sprayed all over. <br/><br/>Our Expert, who seems to have been into some very dark magic back in the day, says "Yay!

It was a nice and gritty street level game where half the characters were ex-Vietnam vets from a failed super soldier program and everyone was flawed in some way.  The GM started us in deep trouble and we spent a good part of the game dodging the man and trying to clear our names.  Would gladly play this again.

We are using Battlebabe (me), Faceless, Maestro, Driver. So if you're familiar with Borderlands, it's almost like a setup ala Roxy's Stadium. Already we've had the faceless strangle a cultist, battlebabe put a bullet through a microganger's colon, the maestro expand his turf with new acts while at the same time boning everything that wanders through town, and the driver setting up a run for supplies. Can't wait for the next session!<br/><br/>Shinobigami: Lisa's psychopathic (surprise!) Kurama Shin-ryu gymnast/assassin decided to sacrifice her life in order to take out the Oni-Blooded love interest. What started out as a session about a heist and romance intrigue ended up in a bloodbath. IIRC, there was a winner that emerged. Eric's "three hotdog neck Hirasaka Agency barrista" tried to game the system to Win, by making a beeline for the prize (held by an NPC) instead of building relationships and grabbing secrets. Which was an interesting strategy! But since he didn't do the slow build of relationships and secrets, he didn't realize that the person he was fighting was secretly on his same "side", and wasn't able to manipulate relationships to help his side/hinder the others. Damn I love this game.<br/><br/>Also played; RRR, 7 Wonders, Agricola, The Resistance and another fantasy Resistance-like game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343129/#Comment_343129" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-17T23:02:54+00:00" title="September 17, 2011 11:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>House con pt 1</b><br/>I ran a game of Witch Quest.

She backs down, cries a little, and he decides it'd be pretty fucked up to hurt her. He leaves her with her boyfriend from the Mudflats and goes on his way.<br/>He doesn't end up getting sick or anything from the needle, so he puts a bandaid on it and forgets about it.<br/>Cue the boyfriend, Bar, getting really pissed and going to tell his farming buddies "this asshole Rue tried to kill me!"<br/><br/>So I hand Rue a little love letter I wrote - - to paraphrase, he rolled +sharp really badly and the farmers grabbed him, but he Acted Under Fire and grabbed his machete, and they all backed off. He put his blade in Bar's head, and then shot both of the others as they ran away. <br/>The gunfire attracted some Mudflats folks and Diamond, the local chopper. <br/>After a bit of a misunderstanding, the Mudflatters attacked Diamond and crew, fended them off, and then Boo the Angel showed up and said she'd be happy to patch everyone up. <br/>The Mudflatters were really happy about that - they kind of get shit on by the hill people, and when Boo managed to completely revive Bar and heal his injuries, they decided to call it a truce. <br/>This was our first actual fight scene, and our first use of Seize by Force - Diamond used this a couple of times to go toe to toe with the Mudflatters alone. We still haven't used Read a Sitch or Read a Person, but that's partly from them not being super curious about the Basic Moves sheet and relying a lot on me for how the system works (which is fine; this is their first time playing AW). <br/><br/>Oh, and our first advance happened today! Diamond the Chopper is gonna think about it for a bit before he chooses, but it's exciting.<br/><br/><b>EDIT:</b> Oh, and the best line of the night goes to Rue the Gunlugger.<br/>Rue: Ha, those assholes are all up in the tunnel, and they're trapped.<br/>MC: So what do you do?<br/>Rue: I got my rifle, right? I'm gonna go up to the mouth of the tunnel and start shooting.<br/>MC: You do remember that Boo, the Angel, is up there, yeah? <br/>Rue: Oh, I remember. [longish pause] Wouldn't want to shoot <i>him</i>, now would we?<br/>MC: Would we?<br/>Rue: Nah. I won't hurt him.

It's a generally grim and nasty setting with filth and grime turned up to 11.  The central point that bound the story together is a strange inscribed stone tablet that has a corrupting/chaos influence on the people who have handled it (the PCs, of course.)  Add in a ton of fear from a warmongering church, too much ambition, and too little impulse control.  In some ways, it played like a fantasy version of Paranoia with everyone being a part of a secret society, having a 'mutation', and a secret desire to mess with the stone for better or worse.  I'm sure the church would have us all tortured, executed, burned, and our ashes scattered if they knew we were playing with the magical equivalent of a dirty bomb.  [Yes, this was 'fun' and a lot of the hurt inflicted we did to ourselves.]  :-)<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343963/#Comment_343963" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-25T18:30:06+00:00" title="September 25, 2011  6:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Sunday Skypers 4]<br/><br/>Was it a good fit for Warhammer stuff?

From the GM's pitch, the setting was inspired by the earlier editions of the rules and the Enemy Within campaign.   He sold the grim and desperate parts pretty well.  The three dice pools (discipline, grim, chaos) represented your primary mundane skill, your level of injury/fatigue/desperation, and your chaos taint/power.  Without going on about DRYH mechanics too much, the more dice (discipline, exhaustion, madness) you have in your pool influences how the outcome is narrated.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344450/#Comment_344450" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T16:04:31+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  4:04PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco: Lucky Strike playset.

They killed the evil druid, chopped down the evil tree and put the possessed adventurers they were supposed to rescue out of their misery. The most interesting and hilarious stuff came afterwards, as they cleared out the rest of the dungeon. Our dragon-obsessed fire sorceror decided to free Calcryx, the kobolds' unwilling white dragon whelp mascot. He's already got CHA 20 got a 24-hour +5 from the Ashardalon Shrine, so he easily convinces Meepo the kobold keeper of the dragon to join the party and free the dragon. The dragon flies back to the surface and Meepo scurries after it, while the party deals with some abysmally low climb checks (including two back-to-back critical fails). When they finally make it to the top, they find the bottom half of Meepo lying in a pool of blood, and Calcryx soars overhead, screeching a thank-you. The fighter, who spent several adventures hanging out getting drunk with Meepo due to real-world player absence, took a dragon-shaped bottle-stopper from the corpse as a token of remembrance. Then, back to town for rewards, petty larceny and a big party at the local tavern. I was stifling delighted laughter the whole time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
