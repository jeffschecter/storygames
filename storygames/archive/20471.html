But our Community is safe inside these walls, thanks to the foresight of our wise Leader. We\u2019ll build up our stores and bolster our defenses for as long as we can, in the hope that we can keep the dreaded Outsiders permanently at bay\u2026</i><br/><br/><i>The Enclave</i> is a collaborative storygame. Over the course of an hour or two, you and your friends will construct a narrative about a community of heroic (or delusional) isolationists, who construct for themselves an entrenched bastion against (what they perceive to be) the hostile forces of the outer world. As they bolster up the defenses of their outpost, they will encounter unexpected misfortunes and betrayals, and fight bravely (or foolishly) against threats from the outsiders whose world they have abandoned, until a final day of reckoning arrives.<br/><br/>*****<br/>I'm looking for playtesters for my new storygame <i>The Enclave</i>. Somewhat remniscent of <i>The Quiet Year</i> and <i>Montsegur 1244</i>, the game takes about ninety minutes to play. The current draft of the rulebook is twenty pages long. While there are a few somewhat novel mechanics, leaning it should be a cinch for experienced storygamers.<br/><br/>All testers who provide substantive feedback will be listed in the credits and receive a free PDF of the game's final version.<br/><br/>Please drop me a note at mark.silcox@att.net if you think you might be interested, and I'll send you an MSWord file of the current ruleset!<br/><br/>best,<br/>Mark Silcox<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450033/#Comment_450033" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T17:26:44+00:00" title="December 15, 2015  5:26PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sent <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
