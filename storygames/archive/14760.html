By tokens I mean any physical thing or do-hicky or widget that represents a resource in the game. I'm especially interested in games which involve some sort of economy or exchange or dynamism with respect to the tokens. <small>(If any of you should be so inclined, please don't quibble with the term "token." That's not what this thread is about. Also don't say things like "Hit Points are basically tokens!" Because they aren't. Assume it is a 12 year old using the work "token," not a part-time philosopher, and read sympathetically.).</small><br/><br/>Tell me the name of the game and give me a simple and quick summary of how tokens/the token economy works in the game. Please focus on games that use tokens as a <i>central</i> mechanic-- Universalis or Do, for example, but not Bennies in Savage Worlds (where Bennies/Tokens are important, but not central to the primary mechanics). And please don't assume that I know much of anything about the game, because chances are that I don't. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer" title="worldnamer"><img alt="worldnamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/224926835_32ff7cf58d_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/worldnamer">worldnamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335604/#Comment_335604" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T23:50:52+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 11:50PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am uncertain what you mean by "central". Ironically, while I've heard of both Universalis and Do, I've not had a chance to play either yet.<br/><br/>That said, I'll make some assumptions. I presume you mean where the token economy is a core part of the game play, such that removing the token economy breaks some or all of the game. I'll start with Fate - for which the tokens are unarguably a first class mechanic. In this system, you use fate points to do all sorts of crazy stuff, including tagging an aspect (calling on parts of the story in a mechanical way), and compelling (getting people to do stuff that's interesting to the story).<br/><br/>Next up would be Don't Rest Your Head, in which players end up getting despair coins, which then get converted to hope coins, both times influencing the effects of the game.<br/><br/>Both of these games are under the auspice of Evil Hat, so there's that.<br/><br/>I would argue that Prime-Time Adventures should be on your list, in which an economy of fan-mail goes to players, and is spent to make those characters more effective in a scene. While this fails the separability test I mentioned earlier, it's such an important part of the system that I can't imagine playing PTA without fan-mail.<br/><br/>&lt;self-promotion&gt;And then there's our game, Becoming Heroes, in which Destiny/Doom are used to fuel threads (meta-narrative hacks) and to provide for the kind of world-ripples you see in epic fantasy.&lt;/self-promotion&gt;<br/><br/>Are you looking for just a starting point, or a discussion about how such mechanics work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335605/#Comment_335605" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T23:51:03+00:00" title="July 21, 2011 11:51PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/shadows/shadows.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/shadows/shadows.html</a></p>\n<p>This is the only token mechanic you need.

At the character creation stage, you specify which other player character your tokens will go to for each stat, e.g. for your 'Smart' stat, anytime you have to push it for a success, you must pay a token to Player <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and so on.

MURPG is a system that demands trying it blind before you'll really get it, but get it you will. The token economy is the very center of the conflict resolution system, managing them as resources, knowing how much you can afford to spend toom long before you get to the end of your rope. It builds good drama and things resolve right.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.robotviking.com/2009/02/17/msgtm-roleplaying-in-a-marketing-dystopia/" rel="nofollow"><strong>MSG(tm)</strong></a>: Seemed to just get lost off the tracks, but the whole thing is about building up resources which you can then bid secretly on project conflicts and augment them with arguments provided only to generate more resources as a fight ... Where everyone in the group is working their own angle, collaboratively, for mass screwage.

I certainly have my work cut out for me reading more about these games and getting some of them to the table. I'd love to hear more suggestions, too-- and bonus points for a brief example, if it would help illustrate the point!<br/><br/>Here are some specific responses:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: worldnamer</cite>Don't Rest Your Head, in which players end up getting despair coins, which then get converted to hope coins, both times influencing the effects of the game.</blockquote>I've actually been meaning to pick this up for a long time. Could you give me a bit more detail about what these different types of coins mean in the fiction and whether they are ever used (expended) or rather saved?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: worldnamer</cite>Are you looking for just a starting point, or a discussion about how such mechanics work?</blockquote>\nFor now, just a starting point. If one doesn't get spun off from this thread, I'll likely start a thread later about mechanics and such. But first I have some playing of games to do. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite><a href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/shadows/shadows.htmlThis" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/shadows/shadows.htmlThis</a> is the only token mechanic you need. The others are all crap. Shadows is short enough that you should just read it, too; no benefit in my paraphrasing.</blockquote>\nThanks for this link! I'd never heard of this little system, but I like-- especially the way it forks the fiction. There's some connections there with some recent games (the Otherkind games, etc.). I always love pointers to micro games like this!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>MURPG is a system that demands trying it blind before you'll really get it, but get it you will. The token economy is the very center of the conflict resolution system, managing them as resources, knowing how much you can afford to spend toom long before you get to the end of your rope. It builds good drama and things resolve right.</blockquote>\nCould you tell me a bit more about how the token economy actually works? It sounds like tokens are static resources which you spend over a session to do things/activate abilities, etc. Is that more or less the case?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Mortal Coil has nothing but tokens, and three relatively small pools of tokens at that.</blockquote>\nI'm interested in what you've said about Mortal Coil. I've heard it mentioned around here numerous times, but I don't really know much of anything about it. Can you give me a bit more detail, especially about how one chooses how to use tokens (e.g. permanent expenditure)? It sounds like this bears further looking-into.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cy</cite>Tokens are central to Capes.</blockquote>\nSo, I've heard all kinds of people talk about Capes around here (often with respect to character ownership and (lack of?) GM-ness), but I don't have any idea how tokens work in the game. Can you give me a brief overview or a short example?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>The grandmammy of a lot of resource-distribution games is, of course,<i>Nobilis</i>.  All three editions are slightly different, as are the larp rules in<i>A Game of Powers</i>.</blockquote>\nAgain, I've heard of Nobilis, but I haven't read or played it. Could you tell me how tokens are used in the game? (Double points for a short example!)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>I've been playing with token based mechanisms for a while, I'll try to post some links to some of my ideas.</blockquote>\nThanks, Michael. I look forward to it-- I've enjoyed hearing from you in the past about mechanics and so forth.<br/><br/><small>Edited to correct for my amazing facility with my native tongue.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335725/#Comment_335725" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T21:10:09+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  9:10PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Again, I've heard of Nobilis, but I haven't read or played it.

Only problem is, he's in Munich! He decides to use his Aspect (the ability to do awesome things with miraculously supported human action) to run really fast! He needs to perform a level 6 Aspect miracle (number made up) to run fast enough.</p>\n<p>Marsiglio has Aspect 4. That means that he can perform Aspect miracles up to level 4 <em>for free.</em> If he wants to do higher-level miracles, he needs to spend tokens (Miracle Points), in chunks of 1, 2, 4, or 8 (I don't know why this is true but it is). So, he needs to spend 2MP to get to the Tokyo bullet train in time.</p>\n<p>Marsiglio spends 2MP and gets there.</p>\n<p>On the way, he runs into a friend of his and his friend asks to bum a cigarette. Because Marsiglio has the Cigarette Bond Affliction, he <em>must</em> hand over a cigarette and stop to have a smoke. Precious time is slipping through his fingers! Because of his Affliction, the HG says, "You get there in time, but only just, and you don't have the luxury of concealing your miraculous actions from regular folks. This will attract some attention." Marsiglio gets 1 MP because his Affliction caused trouble for him!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335734/#Comment_335734" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T22:53:09+00:00" title="July 22, 2011 10:53PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stephen P</cite>Could you tell me a bit more about how the token economy actually works?

She reaches blindly into the bag and pulls one out.<br/><br/>If it's Light, the Peril goes well for her, and she describes how. If it's Dark, the peril goes badly, and the <b>Dark Faerie</b> describes how.<br/><br/>The person describing places the stone back on a card (the rest are discarded). They can place it on any of their own cards, OR on the card their opponent used in the Peril. This represents gaining some kind of control over, mastery of, or resistance to that element. So the <b>Dark Faerie</b> can gain some influence over the hero's Gift or Flaw, the <b>Heroine </b>can learn to cope with or even utilize a Power, and so on!<br/><br/>(The <b>Light Faerie</b> can use their <i>Companion </i>card to interrupt the <b>Heroine </b>and face a Peril in her stead. They then do all the stuff with Stones just like the Heroine would.)<br/><br/>When you've got stones on an opponent's card, you can use that to create or face Perils. So the Dark Faerie turns the Heroine's Flaw against her, the Heroine subverts or co-opts a Power, and so on.<br/><br/>And when the all the Stones have dwindled down to all Light or all Dark, the journey is at an end, and the Heroine either retjurns home bearing all the lessons learned, or stays trapped in Faerie for good!<br/><br/>Hope that helps! What sort of application for Token mechanics are you looking for?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335747/#Comment_335747" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T00:16:25+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 12:16AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (That's the right URL, but it doesn't link)<br/><br/>The game Joel's talking about is <a href="http://storybythethroat.wordpress.com/games/" rel="nofollow">The Dreaming Crucible</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335749/#Comment_335749" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T00:23:50+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 12:23AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, weird.
