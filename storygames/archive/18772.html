The hippy decides she'll become a civil rights lawyer, but never adopts a baby from Africa, the putz who followed her out to Africa sees the relationship for the non-existent sham it is and decides to go back to a new family in Africa, the rich daddys girl realises that she can have true friends who really love her but still follows her path to study at Brown and become a society wife. The world weary older guy manages to get them all to their destinations safely but decides that for the good of the Corps he can never reveal the secret of what happened on the Ivory Coast. Best scene, Sweep (the putz) finally snapping at Elf (the hippy) and telling her he isn't going to moon after her any more. It's over. Very strong.<br/><br/>Dogs - The Outsiders and the Townsfolk are reconciled to help each other survive the winter thanks to a healing miracle on the dying doctor and a successful shootout (for the Dogs) when the Store owner turns out to be a Sorceror determined to stop the heresy of giving aid to the stranded wagon train. There was theology, angsting and everything. Best point for me was revealing the Sorceror with the line "Br Elijah appears shouting 'I will not abide by this heresy' and shoots the doctors wife in the head. What are you doing?" The look on the players faces was wonderful even if it was a bit more *World than DitV.<br/><br/>Ribbon Drive - two old friends drive back to Idaho from New York with a Party Girl and a DJ they don't know is failing to make an impact. They relive the car crash that the uptight friend is denying as they crash in to the back of a car transporter. The Party Girl decides to go back and finish studying classical violin, but never accepts her step dad, the DJ admits he is a failure although finds a way not to give up and go home thanks to finding out he can have people care about him, the uptight guy faces the fact that he was driving the car that put his best friends brother in to a coma and left him barely able to function, when his best friend recovers from the head injury in the current crash he finally finds he can truly smile. The player of the best friend ran for a bus, but we'd like to think that he did go back to Idaho and make a go of that farm although he probably never came to terms with the fact that his brother would never be the person he was before the accident... Fantastic game, but the phone call between the Party Girl and her step dad at the end, where it turned out he truly was a Dick, stood out. "You've been in a car crash in Idaho? Were you driving drunk?"<br/><br/>Yes, it was a wonderful Concrete Cow 13.5 :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421536/#Comment_421536" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T02:46:05+00:00" title="September 16, 2013  2:46AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A troll who can never refuse a deal from a mortal has to convince his housemates that it's a good idea for them to move house for just the weekend so that one of his criminal mates can use their house for his own purposes.<br/><br/>Water Witch: "So what's this other place like?"<br/>Troll: "It's classy, it's got a bidet."<br/><br/>Soon, as video equipment and improbably good looking women start to arrive, the troll gets more desperate to convince his friends to pack up and go.

The Druid wants to draw all the spirits to one area to try and restrain them.  She knows a certain five-pointed intersection in the city that would have especial meaning for them.  The Barbarian cleverly thinks to abduct the son of the son of the son of a man who likely also wronged the spirits.  This man's throat is promptly slit at the intersection.  As the blood trickles down each of the five roads, howling gales of spirits visible only to the Druid come rushing down them.  They enter the gash on the man's throat and the flesh around the wound starts to churn.  The effect spreads as more spirits enter him, and all the flesh of his chest and torso is roiling. More spirits enter, and more, and now his body is spastically writhing and bouncing off the ground.  His arms and fingers simply vibrate off his body and shoot in divergent directions.  The Druid is aghast at what she is done, but realizes she still doesn't know how to contain the spirits.  She consults her own spirits and is met with a disturbing vision.  She steels herself, transforms into a panther, and begins to feast...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422126/#Comment_422126" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T15:43:43+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  3:43PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2013 3:43PM by Keith.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.
