The truth is, even if the game is played clumsily, it will still be *exactly* the game you described, Dave\u2014having to choose between personal and political gain, balancing the needs of various factions, and so on. It's just that the choices will be less compelling (or compelling choices will come less often), advancement may be slower, whatever.<br/><br/>I mean, I think back on the very first time I played BW (outside of a con with Luke). Jonathan White was running, and I was a Dwarven Engineer. All I really wanted was to build giant trebuchets and other awesome war machines and fortifications. Which the system let me do! But inevitably and inexorably, I was drawn into all sorts of interpersonal and factional politics. There are all sorts of ways it wasn't an ideal game\u2014our Beliefs weren't well-structured, we didn't really understand Fight! positioning, etc. However, it absolutely and completely meets all your requirements, Dave.<br/><br/>Oh, and since you mentioned wanting certain things to be more specifically mechanized, I didn't actually play my trump card in that conversation: Burning Kingdoms.

My guys "like" high-LP games but our low-LP games generate way better, more involved storylines. There's also the failure thing that comes with fewer LPs.<br/><br/>I wanted to bring up one more thing, and that's the nature of Beliefs themselves. I think the artha cycle is a really flexible economic tool, but I've found that Beliefs mostly facilitate ego-driven heroes.<i> I believe this big thing, and this is the big thing I'm gonna do to make that happen.</i> That to-do element of "good" Belief writing, which I think kind of evolved over time as a BW best practice (and is obvious from the way the artha payouts are structured), I believe also leads to that ego-driven play. It's exciting to be self-actualized, and the game itself rewards you for it. Not a lot of hapless-heroes-floating-along type action in BW as a result.<br/><br/>So, yeah. I think a lot of small elements feed into an overall tendency toward big politics.\n<blockquote>It seems that some of the major tools for churning out world changes are:<br/>- Duel of Wits stakes<br/>- Duel of Wits major and minor Compromises<br/><br/>BW GMs, have you ever yearned for help making these as awesome as possible, or did you always feel that you had all the support you'd want?</blockquote>\nI'm not exactly sure what you're asking here so I wanted clarification. You mean help from the players, at the table? Or support from the BW community to help frame up how good/hot compromises look? Or official support from BWHQ?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410316/#Comment_410316" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T11:08:44+00:00" title="March 24, 2013 11:08AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2013 11:09AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I meant in-the-moment support.

My inspiration was to take the "character actions ripple out and produce various significant consequences out there in the larger world" feature of some campaigns and really highlight that.  So, my PCs are ambassadors, negotiating with various factions in the kingdom, trying to end wars and such, but also trying not to screw themselves and the kingdom in other ways by generating bad blood with unpopular actions.  Being nice and being everyone's friend only gets you so far; sometimes it might seem like mercilessly crushing the opposition is the way to go, but then you have to worry that (a) they'll seek vengeance on your sister, (b) they'll start training warriors to wreak future havoc, (c) the next faction you meet will be wary of you, etc.<br/><br/>I was excitedly telling Matt about this cool thing I'd provide for gamers, and his response was "anyone who plays Burning Wheel already gets that".<br/><br/>So in this thread I'm trying to get a better idea of what BW provides, and what I might provide that'd be meaningfully different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410390/#Comment_410390" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T11:12:29+00:00" title="March 25, 2013 11:12AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tl;dr: I'm a bad person who tells people their ideas have already been done. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410432/#Comment_410432" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-25T19:23:54+00:00" title="March 25, 2013  7:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2013 7:24PM by PaulB.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It might be interesting to move authority for that consequence into the rules and out of the hands of the players, yeah. <br/><br/>DOW is a tool for player versus player (not character versus character) confrontations, which is why the secret sauce lies in moving the players to a point where they're actually compromising with each other.
