You are able to accept meta-input, you are able to think out loud, exploring multiple actions, all without negatively impacting the game experience. None of this is true in improv. If you're thinking about plot, you're not thinking about what's going on in front of you, and that's when really bad things happen.<br/><br/>Like I said, there are things that can be done to ameliorate that. HOWEVER, I have not been able to try any of them out. I really think the path is to import short-form techniques (which at their best are rituals with varying input) to a long-form setting.

It's very constraining for a reason.  Example: "Ok, Tony and John are on a rowboat moving away from a burning ship.  Tony, you can only use sentences of five words.  John, sentences of three words.  Go!!"<br/><br/>I find it very hard to get that sort of buy-in from a tabletop group for a scene much less an entire session.  Players have agendas, others want to tell a certain type of story, and still others are basically there to be entertained.  And just like one performer who "doesn't get it" will often cause an improv scene to fall flat, it only takes one gamer at a table saying "wait" to knock the group off-balance.<br/><br/>Now I listen to AP reports and podcasts from (specifically) Remi and Jason's group, and they are focused like a fricken laser beam.  They have a small group with what seems to be enormous buy-in.  They appear to self-enforce setting and they are all prepared for the envitable cockpunching.  But tell me if I'm wrong here.<br/><br/>But I don't have a regular group and my game sessions are often ad-hoc with a few reoccuring players and whomever drops in at the store.  I also play a lot at minicons.<br/><br/>So, at least in my experiences, buy-in and perhaps ritual are keeping me from having an "improv-like" experience at the table.  It's not so much a concept of plot and characterization...or maybe we just haven't got to that level yet:)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64996/#Comment_64996" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T10:43:19+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 10:43AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>In our first improv class, we were told to religiously avoid plot.

One incident that keeps coming to mind was the infamous "Flaming Taft" game at GenCon last year. Remi and Joshua had one scene that was totally plot. They knew what it was going to be about,  it was amazingly relevant to the overall story, and they went hard for it. To me, despite how relevant it was, it wasn't all that satisfying. Later, I started a scene where I had no idea how it was relevant to the plot. I just knew I had my girlfriend written down on the sheet, and I wanted to see what happened in a scene with her. We played it slow, just reacting to what was going on, until Judd realized he wanted in on it too. Even then, we didn't drive toward a conclusion, but once we figured out what needed to happen, it became amazingly relevant to the plot. That, to my mind, was much more satisfying. (And to other people, given the comments we got afterward.) We just took it line by line and reacted to what the other person was doing. The result became plot, in so far as it defined where future scenes would go, but it wasn't driven there. <br/><br/>That's been my experience with improv as well. You frame scenes with the knowledge of what's gone before, but they work best when you don't let the plot drive them and instead just react to what the other person is doing. I've been doing a lot more of this in my tabletop play (it works especially well in PTA, which is what we're playing right now) with similarly pleasing results.<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65001/#Comment_65001" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T10:47:22+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 10:47AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, we've seen that, too.

If you're endowing me with the fact that I'm a knife-wielding psychopath in a short-form, that's no problem. That endowment only lasts for the scene. In most tabletop games, you have to live with that for the rest of the game, so who knows how long that will last. In think that buy-in gets psychologically easier in one-shots.<br/><br/>I also think that the mindset that "the character is sacrosanct" is the biggest barrier to using more improv techniques in tabletop play.

After a playtest/design session of The Naked City this past weekend, I'm starting to move towards an ensemble cast approach where players choose a different character to play each Act of the game.  I'm curious to see whether this will change the scene dynamics by removing the "my character wouldn't do that" constraints.  <br/><br/>IOW, if you can hop around from character-to-character, perhaps it will be easier to get that "lets go with it" buy-in for individual scenes since it's not really "your" character.  Then the GM can worry about continuity and making sure the story (and not necessarily the plot) is moving along.<br/><br/>Interesting conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65013/#Comment_65013" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T11:07:01+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 11:07AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caesar: What you're talking about are basic short-form improv games, and it's incorporating exactly those constraining elements that you can get to plot. (However, I have a coach whose rule is the more constraints off-stage, the LESS plotty you should try to be on-stage, which seems a bit chinese finger-trappy to my thinking, but might be valid, I'm at the point where I need to try for myself). And you're right about buy-in, but I think that's a side-issue. I'd argue that the absolute moment-to-moment selflessness needed in improv is a different beast from the conditional, occasional buy-in of gaming, at least in the games I've played.<br/><br/>Paul: You are right, that scene was really, really great. And the scene I had with Joshua was frustrating because we weren't accepting (or hearing) the other's input, even though we entered the scene with superficially similar views of the outcome, it turned out we wanted very different things. HOWEVER, you played that way pretty much all night, and you got one super-awesome scene out of it. I seem to recall one or two aimless, pointless time-wasters of scenes, as well, and that's the danger of not ever going for plot at all in a game, that you'll just be having character moments without really going anywhere. You end up with mush. I really think that roleplaying best occupies a middle-ground where consideration is a part of the game, but occasional scenes with no goal, but plenty of system and story support, are golden.<br/><br/>I'd argue that your great scene rested on some solid, if not spectacular, plot work on the part of the other participants in the game, and you and Judd played a very appropriate scene at a very charged moment in the game. Perhaps I am putting the cart before the horse, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65014/#Comment_65014" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T11:18:54+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 11:18AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmmm.

"Here's my favorite book in Latin, would you please read this first passage?" is the classic example. Experienced improvisors can get out of it, but sometimes it can be difficult and un-fun.

My experience playtesting and then getting reviews for the game made me think, on this every limited data set, that short-form improv exercises aren't that hard for roleplayers to get into, that they are a very useful alternative option to (not replacement for) player negotiated or gm-created situation creation, but that there's a bit of concern about improv in a game setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65020/#Comment_65020" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T11:45:26+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 11:45AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wanted to make this clear: I think the uses of short-form techniques in roleplaying are quite clear.

By "leverage" Emily is referring to a lack of power in the story, I think in terms of the character's ability to affect/be connected to things, not specifically the player's ability to do stuff mechanically. I nearly had the same sorts of problems in my game of Mortal Coil at Endgame recently, where at the midpoint I was kind of wondering if I hadn't written myself out of the story by accident. Fortunately (and through the great insight of my fellow players and GM Carl Rigney) I managed to get into the game in a key way for the finale, which enabled a great scene between me and Ryan Macklin, but that's another story.<br/><br/>What I'm wondering is: are there things we could bring to bear here from what Keith Johnstone calls reincorporation? Are there any games or mechanics that specifically drive or reward reincorporating characters or aspects of characters?

The decision to conciously reincorporate an element from earlier in a game is an effective technique that can be used no matter what your play style is. Reintroducing an element increases its power, in any game. Familiarity breeds engagement, engagement breeds good gaming, whether it's engagement in the character, or engagement in the dungeon encounter. Reincorporation makes better games where you're experiencing AND creating, instead of one or the other. Seriously, I'm not talking about super-immersionist actor-play here. I play almost exclusively in a directorial-style and the techniques of improv have been nothing but a boon to my play.<br/><br/>The most important skill in improv is not acting, but active listening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65049/#Comment_65049" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T13:08:49+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  1:08PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Remi</cite>The most important skill in improv is not acting, but active listening.</blockquote>\nListen to Remi.

There's scads of reward for reincorporating your own stuff, and GM-ful games that reward players and GMs when the GM hits something on the player's character sheet again, but what are the mechanics that reward players for looking out for each other and making sure other folks are connected into the story? Thematic batteries, from what I've heard (note to self: get hands on FLFS), are one great example. However, my understanding is that invoking someone else's Aspect in SotC is largely for the GM to do... am I wrong?
