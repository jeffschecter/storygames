But I figure I might learn something from it... and, after all, who knows?)<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>Playtesting a game of my own design ("Land of Nodd"), I had a player create a character I had no idea how to challenge--at least not on the spot. For the purposes of this post, just assume that I was the GM, and the player the sole PC. The system is a light one with very few obvious Flags.<br/><br/>The setting was a near-future cyberpunk kind of situation. The character in question was an old, frail, but very intelligent man, who had become, in his old age, the CEO and owner of a huge megacorporation based in California (Silicon Valley). His goal in life at this point is to poison millions of people in China by feeding nasty stuff into the water supply. The way this particular game is set up, the story should revolve around this goal of his, and whether he manages to achieve it or not. The story begins with him living comfortably in California, surrounded by bodyguards, friends, etc. No important family members or connections exist at this point (it's a very pick-up-and-play sort of game).<br/><br/>What kinds of compelling situations can I present him with, throw at him? Remember, they must be related to his overall goal of poisoning huge numbers of people in China. Assume a Narrativist bent in terms of the game itself, if that helps at all. More precisely, I'm looking for stuff the player cares about, and there's not much in the way of mechanics/system that can be gamed or used simply to "explore" stuff (as in, say, d20).<br/><br/>Any ideas? What, as the GM, can I throw at him, given this little information? Or is this setup doomed to failure and suckiness?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166217/#Comment_166217" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T01:48:29+00:00" title="August 30, 2008  1:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            how about he starts poisening people, and people / the media / the chinese government / whatever exists in the gameworld start finding out he's behind it all, and want to expose / sue / kill him?<br/><br/>or maybe someone retaliates in kind and poisons San Francisco, and he's the only one with the means to stop them?<br/><br/>I'm also thinking of someone he cares about getting poisoned and needing rescuing, but does he care about anyone?<br/><br/>also: why does he want to poison thousands of Chinese, and if it's not pre-established, who gets to decide?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166220/#Comment_166220" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T04:02:53+00:00" title="August 30, 2008  4:02AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since this is his life goal now, he doesn't care about anything once it is completed.  So retaliation after the fact has no effect on him.  He has buildings full of lawyers and oceans of cash to buffer him during a trial.  And a life sentence would mean little to him.  So attacking him in this way doesn't do anything.<br/>\nThe point is to stop the attack or make it such that he doesn't see the plan go through.  So he either needs to die before it is complete or it is stopped.<br/>\nHave him, as CEO, be REQUIRED to go to the very area he is poisoning during the time of the poisoning.  The tension comes from him trying to avoid any native water while still eating, washing, bathing, etc..  While this could be possible given his status and resources, there are probably ways around that he may not think of that you could use to poison him.  At any rate I would completely distract him from enjoying the people dying if he is trying to avoid being poisoned.  Just his paranoia would be worth something.  Being old and frail the poison could affect him quickly so that he doesn't get to see people dying much.<br/>\nThis assumes a fast acting poison.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps one of his bodyguards is Chinese-American with family that will be affected.  The guard discovers the plan and kills Mr. Rich before the plan goes through or is complete.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is not the sole owner of the company, have a coup.  He is ousted in disgrace, left without any power what so ever in the company, and maybe even penniless.<br/>\n<br/>\nCar/Plane crash.  He's dead.  Or stranded in China during the poisoning.  Or crashes in the very reservoir that he has poisoned and drowns in the poisoned water.  EC comicy goodness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's cyberpunk so there must be hackers.  Someone in China hacks the plan.  Redirects the plan to San Francisco.  Or just shuts it down.  They then redirect his billions to the various relief agencies in China.  He is penniless.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this helped.  It was certainly a fun exercise for me.  I like to work the creative muscles on someone else's ideas occasionally.<br/>\ntomg                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166222/#Comment_166222" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T05:13:44+00:00" title="August 30, 2008  5:13AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, in a narrativist game, it all depends on why he could possibly want to do this.

Because it's not a moral question in and of itself. That's not a question of whether they the person inside can do it, it's a question of whether they the person outside can do it. Does he possess the capabilities to succeed at his goal?<br/><br/>To turn this into a moral question I'd go with, yes, he can do it, that's never in doubt, and then the question would become, does he want to do it, and how much is it worth for him. So him doing it would provide the framework for the scenes to follow. But those scenes will only superficially be about doing the actions required to commit genocide. In reality, they would be an opportunity to tilt his world. <br/><br/>His daughter showing up to say that she's going there, or marrying someone from there. A long time friend with family there, whatever. A connection telling him that the only person with the necessary knowledge of toxicology is the assassin who killed his brother. Tell him that certain people he requires are in prison and they are demanding that he do X if they are to help him. Have him find out about a reporter who knows too much and is about to expose him. Introduce elements to ask him, "are you still sure you want to do this?" What those elements are will depend a lot on the character and what has bothered him the most already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166255/#Comment_166255" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T12:14:38+00:00" title="August 30, 2008 12:14PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good points, across the board. Maybe it makes sense to separate the two approaches--success at a goal vs. exploring a premise. I'd like to focus on the "success" angle for a moment. So:<br/><br/>Let's say we drop the "moral decision" angle for a second and focus on "can he do it". The problem here is that most of the action is being done by people in his employ--his workers, often halfway around the world. While insubordination, rebellion, etc, as you have advised, is a good option, it's also going to get stale real fast if overused. I find it hard to imagine any tense, active scenes for this old man.<br/><br/>How can his progress be challenged in meaningful ways? For instance, I can envision scenes where a lieutenant comes to him with a tough decision: "Our operations have been spotted. If we continue in Beijing, we'll be investigated by the Chinese Air Force." This requires him to make a choice--and, often, this is where the moral/ethical angle can come back into play. That can create _internal_ conflict. But how does one create _external_ conflict in such a scene--a situation where we're really unsure how things will turn out and who will prevail? All the scenes about such characters that I am familiar with from movies, books, etc, come down to a conversation in an office, ending with a decision and an order given by the chief. All the action and actual conflict happens off-screen or involves other characters. How do we create some variety in these scenes, some different types of scenarios?<br/><br/>(I think I'm going to start another thread about internal conflict, so let's leave that be for now.)<br/><br/>The suggestion to send him into the thick of it is good, of course. It seems to me that trying to convince the player  that his character needs to go there would be a bit<br/>of unfun, so I would probably just ask the player how they feel about it and then frame to the action there ("you land on a private helipad in a small Chinese town..."). But what would he be doing there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166257/#Comment_166257" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-30T12:36:58+00:00" title="August 30, 2008 12:36PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>The problem here is that most of the action is being done by people in his employ--his workers, often halfway around the world.

The simple fact that 'Can I?' and 'What does it mean to me?' are often questions posed to me simultaneously in real life often enough leads me to believe it ought to be possible to handle both of them together in a game.  I find this kind of either-or thinking fairly dangerous, in terms of preferences and group dynamics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166618/#Comment_166618" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T10:48:01+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 10:48AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.  This is sort of off the top of my head, but it feels like I'm on the right track.<br><br>Gamist approach:  PC has goal.  PC tries to achieve goal in face of opposition.<br/><br/>Narrativist appraoch:  PC has (at least) two goals.  PC tries to choose between them.<br/><br/>I'm not sure there is sufficient support for narrativism with a character who has exactly one all-consuming GOAL and who cares about nothing else.<br/><br/>But, like I say, I haven't given this much thought so I might be barking up the wrong tree.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166627/#Comment_166627" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:33:16+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:33AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2008 11:37AM by TonyLB.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Tony,<br/><br/>That's a neat idea! So, how would one of those scenes look, in play?<br/><br/>Would it be the CEO, sitting at his desk, receiving mind-boggling reports, then deciding what to do next... and then we break out the rules to see what the results are?<br/><br/>It sounds a bit... dry, but it could work.</blockquote>Well, if it were me, I'd lift a page from <i>Terra Incognita</i>:  Play out the fight scene in flash-back.<br/><br/>Your evil billionaire gets to say things like "You idiot!  I send you out armed with the best in military grade weaponry, and you still fail me?"<br/><br/>Then the guy playing the hero gets to say things like "But boss, he had flashing fists of kung fu fury ... what good are armor piercing rounds when we can never draw a bead on the guy?"<br/><br/>The fact of (at least temporary) foilage is established by the mooks coming back in defeat ... so the stakes become what the mastermind <i>gained</i> during the setback.<br/><br/>"Ahhhh ... so you say that he appeared when spunky girl reporter Li Tzen Chu was threatened?  Innnnnnnteresting.  Leave me.  I must consider what to do with this information."<br/><br/>Which implies, of course, that the hero can only be defeated when the mastermind himself makes a personal appearance, and the scene is played out in real-time.  Flashback scenes are always flashbacks of partial-to-total defeat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166630/#Comment_166630" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T11:45:57+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 11:45AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2008 11:46AM by Paul_T.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, <br/><br/>Excellent!
