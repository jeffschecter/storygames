How do you communicate setting and character constraints though? Those are rules. Was there any discussion before play about what the setting would be? I mean, your description of it as a "pervasive, immerse, trans-media ockult horror larp that runs 24/7 for 2 months" is, itself, a rule that sets:<br/><br/>* scope (pervasive, 24/7)<br/>* duration (2 months)<br/>* setting (occult horror)<br/>* play style (live action role-play)<br/>* play goals (immersion)<br/>* technical goals (trans-media)<br/><br/>That's a lot packed in one sentence! How did that get communicated to players? Was there other setting information shared, or did that stuff just get decided after play started?<br/><br/>I'm imagining that a whole bunch of people get together with the intent to do some kind of role-playing, but without /any other direction/. Someone tells everyone, "The campaigns rules are simple, we show respect towards non-participants and we use safe words if needed." That's it. People start role-playing, and it /turns into/ an occult horror LARP that /happens/ to continue 24/7 for two months, and because of that, /ends up/ being immersive and pervasive, and because it's so immersive and pervasive, /becomes/ trans-media... is that how it happened?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435714/#Comment_435714" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-23T15:11:09+00:00" title="July 23, 2014  3:11PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to tell you, but I am in the mountains right now organizing Midnight Sun Con.

That sort of grew. And grew. And developed Over 8 years. So it didn't happen fast.<br/><br/>It has a rich setting, yet the magic circle are not clearly defined. It very much fucking with the magic circle. You don't know what the limits of the game is. You don't know what true in the setting or not. Much of the structure is informal and undefined. <br/><br/>The setting is not all that much communicated to the players. You given ar rough idea that it an occult game in modern setting, that characters might have supernatural powers, Or they might not. You send the organizers a rough character concept based on that vague information and they approve it or approve it with some changes. Then your character has to hit the floor running. They get recruited into secret occult organisation and has to learn the setting as the character learns it.<br/><br/>The GM has the last word, but there are now definitive limits to what you can do in game. Perhaps your character makes a circle of salt as a ward sgainst the murderous spirits. Perhaps it will work. You never know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435981/#Comment_435981" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T12:54:21+00:00" title="July 29, 2014 12:54PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, how did it become a trans-media game?

First the campaigns events spans the whole larp spectrum. From 360 degrees illusion events, to pure black box events. But the campaigns also uses freeform tabletop play, video conferences, phones, different uses of digital media, artwork, sound recordings, etc. It will use and abuse whatever media it gets is hands on.<br/><br/>The campaign have had the same organizers since it beginning, and lot of built on trust. Or on blindly trusting the organizer Emmelie Nordstr\xf6m. The fiction is consistent (small details might change by accident), so if a salt circle suddenly didn't work e would have to figure out why it didn't work this time. What is different? What has changed? Horror is built on fear of the unknown so you can never be sure.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435987/#Comment_435987" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-29T14:01:14+00:00" title="July 29, 2014  2:01PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was communicated to players at the beginning?

During the campaign months Emmelie easily put in at least 40 hours of work with the campaign each week. You can as player spend hours each days playing in different ways. There are about 20 players, because that is the maximum to be able to run such a super intense game. The process is that you hear lapers obsess about the game for 10 months of the year, and if you get a chance to the join the campaign you jump at it.<br/><br/>But, the English hompage is not yet ready.
