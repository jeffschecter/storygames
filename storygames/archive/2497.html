<p>Elliot, I'm bummed that I'm not in the Bay Area. But I'd love it if you'd come out here to Western Mass, though. I think you'll find that our rates are very reasonable.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You know, this is the kind of response one gets when charging exorbitantly in a buyer's market. I mean, I'm not even sure I could <em>count</em> the number of excellent GMs I know. But off the top of my head:</p>
<p>Nathan Paoletta, Judd Karlman, Vincent Baker, Luke Crane, Matt Snyder, Meguey Baker...</p>
<p>Wait, I'm not going to list every friend I've got.</p>
<p>In case I've been unclear: I dislike intensely the commoditization of creativity. To me, this is the equivalent of coming here and offering to be someone's substitute in a game. I appreciate that, at 12.50 a game, you're not exactly making a profit when you're providing snacks, but that just means you're undercharging for your services; any group can bring chips over.</p>
<p>So, since this clearly isn't a profit making venture, could I suggest that you just have some friends over to play?</p>

                            Actually, at $50 per game ( assuming 4 players x 12.50/week), there is a smallish profit being made after the cost of snacks.<br/><br/>OTOH, I'm not sure this is really any different than hosting a college kegger and charging $5 per cup for all you can drink 'til it runs out.                        </div>

                            I am totally serious.  <br/><br/>Komradebob has my number.  Smallish profit.  Enough to suit my needs until I get around 16 players per week (and split it into three groups.)<br/><br/>A friend of mine got me into gaming by inviting me to a D&amp;D afterschool program at double the cost I'm charging.  His rationale for charging was that he's the best GM around, and after playing with him I got no complaints.  That's his only source of income.<br/><br/>I am trying to do this as a part-time job, then expand it to a real job.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Assuming that the game really is that awe-inspiring?                        </div>

                            The only thing I see "wrong" with it is that it runs against the tradition of gaming culture. Musicians charge, actors charge, caterers charge, painters charge. Writers write and try to get paid.<br/><br/>Unlikely? Sure.<br/><br/>Immoral or soulless? I dunno. Definitely not something I'd try to take up as a full-on income maker.<br/><br/>OTOH, a whole lot of folks around these parts write games and charge for that. Is it really that far-fetched to posit running a game and charging at some level ? I mean, casinos get a rake when they run games...                        </div>

See, I don't beleive that either.<br/><br/>But I beleive that the GM can help the other players come up with fun.<br/><br/>When they say "I save the ship!" the GM can ask "Oh?  How?"<br/><br/>When they say "I shut down the reactor!" the GM can ask "Oh?  Why?"<br/><br/>Until the players get it and hit that sweet spot where they go "I shut down the reactor to save the ship!" every time.<br/><br/>My goal isn't to be the source of the fun.<br/><br/>My goal is to unlock the source of the fun within the players.<br/><br/>And dammit, unlocking the fun is hard work!                        </div>

                            Judd, <br/><br/>Sure... but if all of that is true, if you're really playing a game where the GM has to supply the awesome and the fun and the GM does supply the awesome and the fun... then doesn't him getting paid make a kind of sense? I mean, much as you and I might want the game of which you speak, lets be real honest -- a lot of players really do play, and want, the magical GM game. And since it's magic, and you'd pay a birthday clown who pulled a coin out of your child's nose, why not? <br/><br/>I mean, I laugh out loud at the idea, then snicker all night long in my smug sense of self-superiority, but that's because I'm a jerk and not because there is anything fundamentally wrong with the idea. <br/><br/>Now using SG for advertising it is maybe a bit spammy, but hell, some of us pimp our games that we've designed here enough that its not like there isn't a precedent for that too.                        </div>

                            komeradebob &amp; Brand make the points I'd have made, but more diplo than I would have. Also: so standup comics are just doing what they do for a buck? They don't get anything else out of it? There is a difference in the interactivity, granted.<br/><br/>I also pay $6 every Endgame minicon, part of which is transferred to the GMs. The rest goes to "the house" for organizing. Fees also help ensure that people show up.<br/><br/>Do I think $50/game (er, make that $12.50) is reasonable? Well, I don't think I'll be ringing Elliott up, but if nothing else this is an interesting experiment.                        </div>

                            As a point of comparison, I've seen other, primarily minis-friendly, gamers suggest similar costs per week as membership in a gaming club. If E.B. has put a target on his head for suggesting charging for services, a quick presentation change and suddenly he's being an altruistic sort  paying for the costs of organizing an on-going game at his home.<br/><br/>As a second point of comparison, I used to go to a bi-weekly poker game with a $20 buy-in and an average $10 re-buy of chips, held at a local bar. You paid for you own bevvies and snacks, too. That's already a bit more than EB was talking about ( although, a winnig night brought money back to you).<br/><br/>I still think you're Quixotic, though, EB...                        </div>

                            After I can the snark, the thought that comes up is that I can reasonably demand a theater refund my ticket if I was so unhappy with either the performance <i>or</i> the rudeness of others in the audience that I left in the middle of it.<br/><br/>I suppose my question for Elliot is this:  if one of the other players is a complete asshat, can I demand a refund?<br/><br/>This does sound bizarre.  I'm just a 90 minute drive east of Berkeley -- in Sacramento -- and this idea doesn't strike me as natural.  Maybe it's very localized the just the Bay.  I know I wouldn't do it, for if nothing else, the act of payment would shift a lot more on my shoulders than I'd normally feel comfortable with, just like a con game.

                            Yeah, my second GM after my father was a fellow than ran a game as part of an after school program at the local middle school for which we paid a fee.  Parents got a kid free afternoon, kids got to game, guy presumably got paid.  Win-win-win. This was in Jersey for the record.<br/>
<br/>
I think when its kids though its a different mindset.  Parent's are conditioned to pay an activity that their kids like and gets them out of the house for a time.  You are paying them to deal with kids more than for the activity.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to ask though, am I reading your ad correctly that you only meet for two hours a session from 4-6? I can't believe anyone would pay for only two hour sessions of gaming.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliott Belser</cite>Actually, $50 gets you one game every week for a month... $12.50 for a game, and snacks.</blockquote>
That's pretty cheap! <br/><br/>Although there is a complication when discussing this in context of traditional games vs. GMless games. <br/><br/>At <a href="http://www.nerdnyc.com/forum" rel="nofollow">nerdnyc.com's Gotham Gaming Guild</a>, we charge about $7-8 per player per game. Mainly for renting space in Manhattan (and we have a sweet deal, it should probably be much higher for NYC). GMs play for free. But 50-75% of our games are Story Games, many GMless. So there is no GM. And there is no prep. All issues to consider. <br/><br/>But for a full blown D&amp;D game with hours of prep, I think charging for GM services, outside of your friends, depending on the balance of supply and demand in your area, can be very reasonable. And for a more traditional game, even with your friends, I think the players should at least buy or pitch in for books rather than have the GM pay for everything.<br/><br/>I know several people in upstate NY that have combined GM services + daycare into a package for children in their local community. With ranges of $8-25 an hour per child. <br/><br/>It really depends on supply and demand in your specific area. For people who have RPG groups, or are GMs themselves, I can completely understand why this would seem so strange. The major reasons we started the GGG is so that local gamers can meet other gamers in their area. And as they become comfortable with each other, they go off on their own and form their own groups. So the more successful the GGG becomes, the more players we loose! Hahahahahaha. <br/><br/>I also don't think it is cool to charge your friends in most cases. I don't charge my friends for computer advice. But if I'm doing 4-6+ hours of free work, I will try to stop there and recommend a few freelance or outside professional options that could help them.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.behemoth3.com/otherworld" rel="nofollow">Also check out behemoth3's otherworld excursions as another example of a paid GM service.</a><br/><br/>You can also find additional examples in Greece, Norway, and Sweden.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite><br/><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>I SUMMON ANDY KITKOWSKI!<br/><br/>ANDY KITKOWSKI, JUDGE THIS THREAD!</b></span></blockquote>
..which is kind of hilarious, because I saw the thread title last night, and didn't read the thread (thinking it was just a provocative title to attract players for a regular game). I didn't read it until about 30 minutes ago (I'm like "40+ posts? What's up with tha.... <b>ohhhhh</b>...").<br/><br/>So yeah, where's the mauve? Ah, there it is: <b><span style="color: #FF66CC;">THREAD IS KOSHER. JUDGMENT HAS PASSED</span></b>.<br/><br/>I mean, it's sure *weird* and all to me, but it's in the right area for pimping stuff and services, etc.<br/><br/>But yeah, I recall people talking about charging for games a couple years back on RPGNet. You could imagine the discussion that ensued. In the end, I think the entirety of the thread can be explained by one word: <b>CALIFORNIA</b> (though I would almost expect this more in LA than the Bay Area; I can see someone making a living as Dungeon Master to the Stars and other Hollywood Types).<br/><br/>Uh... good luck? I think I speak for all of us when I say, "I'm really interested in seeing how this turns out, so let us know!"<br/><br/>Other random thoughts:<br/>* Tony: Being the Bay Area, I'd wager $50 per player. Costs of living and all that.<br/><br/>* If you break down the relationships at my gamng tables into a pure money-gravy system, it would look something like this: The GM gets paid $10 "Shadow Dollars" a week in total from the group of four players.  In return, the GM pays the players $2.50 in Shadow Dollars back, to have the players show up for the game. Also, the host charges a "seating fee" of $5.00 per week to the group, which is often repaid once a month or whatever when someone eventually brings in soda, snacks, ice cream, etc. In the end, no money is exchanged because everything works out. For the Player-centric minded, then nix the word GM: Say each of the 5 players pays $5 a week to play in their weekly game, and in return they receive $5 for providing the others ($1 per person) with a good time; again, no money is actually exchanged.  Weird, but maybe you can break it down like that. <br/><br/>* In Japan, when I wanted some part time cash, I would set up an English conversation group and charge $30-50 a week (or 'session') to a group of anywhere between 6 to 10 people. I'd certainly have lesson plans, activities, and real teaching mechanisms, but in the end it was a lot of fun and a nice way to score some cash. I *would* have done it for free with friends, but in the end I didn't have to because there were nice people willing to pay. I guess that's what the market would bear. So in that regards, if there's folks who would pay for it, and you're giving that service for pay, then that's nothing more than a round red peg in a form-fitting round hole.<br/><br/>Still, though, *weird*. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>I think this is a perfectly valid response to the fact that trad-gaming GM work is so hard.</blockquote>
Well, save that really it isn't.<br/><br/>I mean, I do trad-gaming GMing, because I enjoy it.  If it was hard I'd do something else.  I figure the same applies to the other guys in my group who GM sometimes.<br/><br/>Trad-game GMing is fun, or it isn't, if it isn't there are some excellent alternatives out there which are also fun.  There's some great shared authorial power games I'd happily recommend to people.<br/><br/>I mean, I don't mind some guy charging, whatever, but this stuff isn't hard.  Or if it is, it's rewarding hard, like say modelling a plane correctly is hard but rewarding if you're a plane modelling guy (by which I mean constructing model planes, rather than say dressing like a plane and modelling, not that there's anything wrong with that).                        </div>

I'm just a 90 minute drive east of Berkeley -- in Sacramento -- and this idea doesn't strike me as natural.  Maybe it's very localized the just the Bay.

If one of the players is a complete asshat, that player would receive one warning before not being invited back to the next game.<br/><br/>In this case, if it caused other players to not want to come back, the players who didn't want to come back would receive refunds.<br/><br/>However, the player who was an asshat would not.<br/><br/>This would clearly be set down in the rules discussed in the first session.                        </div>

I'd love to see more games, trad or indie or whatever, emphasise that we're all in charge of the fun.  Actually, I'd particularly like to see trad games say it more, all too often they imply it's the GM's job and that really doesn't make much sense at the end of the day.                        </div>

It's why part way through my post I started talking about rewarding hard, because of course you're right.<br/><br/>Is trad gming any harder though than sharing the responsibility of creating a cool story?  I doubt it.                        </div>

1: Thanks kindly.<br/><br/>2: I promise that I will give a monthly bulliten.  I have a blog at l_the_fangirl.livejournal.com that I can use for updates too.<br/><br/>3: True.  It must rock on toast every time, or they won't come back.  Still, I have ideas on how to make that happen, and Story Games and the Forge showed the way.  Remind me to thank Vincent "say yes or roll the damn dice" Baker.<br/><br/>4: For a given value of "Exciting."  I consider it an educational opportunity, myself.  Teach people these hippy games in a fairly trad setting.<br/><br/>5: Why do you think it's pay-per-month?  Also, I'll be mean/a shrewd businessman/standing on the shoulders of my old GM, John Frankenhiem/an awesome GM and end on cliffhangers.  Mwu ha and ha again.<br/><br/>6: Hail Freedonia, Land of the Brave And Free.  Now Go Play!                        </div>

                            You know, I find it so very funny that on a forum where we regularly talk about how bad and silly it is when people scream "THAT IS NOT AN RPG" that there is a real strain of response in this here thread that boils down to "THAT IS NOT AN RPG!" <br/><br/>Only difference is we're talking about how RPGs get played in the social world rather than how they get designed. But I figure, fuck, if we're not going to experiment with different ways of structuring RPGs socially all the rest isn't going to get us near as far as we'd like. And hell, this is a pretty diametrically opposite response to Malcolm's idea of playing only with your real life friends -- which didn't seem all that popular around here. So between the two extremes maybe we can, you know, actually discover models of setting up games that aren't the same shit we've done since 1974 and just assumed its the way an RPG must be played. <br/><br/>I'll stop now though, 'cause really, its the same host of answers we give to the "THAT IS NOT AN RPG" guys that apply to most of the objections here. <br/><br/>Max, <br/><br/>I find your point worth responding to in specific. I find writing hard and rewarding. I also get paid for my writing. Many folks find designing a game hard and rewarding. They also get paid for their games, because they want money from you before they give you a copy. If I can get paid to write and they can get paid to design, why not get paid to GM?                        </div>

                            I don't object to somebody else paying or charging for their game, but for my part there is <span style="color: #CC3300;">No Way In Hell</span> I would do either.  I game exclusively with friends except at club events.  Everyone makes a great effort of <i>some</i> sort: the GM, yes, but the players who travel a long distance to be at the game, the people who write game notes, the players who always have lots of background material on their characters, everyone who is always throwing plot lines, the people who bake for everyone, etc.  Bringing money into our little ecology would be a disaster:
<ul>
<li>As a GM, I can only do this for fun.  If I charged, it would become work -- and I already work five days a week.</li>
<li>As a GM, if I charged, I would feel like I owe something qualitatively and quantitatively different to the players.  For example, if we dissolve into 15 minutes of kibitzing but the players are having a good time -- am I meeting my obligation or not?  I would stress about that all the time.</li>
<li>As a player, I would have the lingering impression that the GM cares exactly as much about the game, me, the group, etc. as an actor at the theater or as a store owner: sure, they want us to have a good time, but it's a pretty impersonal relationship and if we <i>don't</i> have a good time, gee, that's too bad.</li>
<li>Both as player and as GM, I would be concerned that some or all the players might start thinking of the game in terms of its cost: "Shucks, I want to go to the movies with my friends but the gme is in the way.  Ah, that's OK -- I'm paid up for the month."  Or simply: "Hey, I don't NEED to play nice.  I <i>paid</i> for this."</li>
<li>If Player X can't afford the cost but we really love Player X, do we pitch in or cut her a break to have her on board?  What if it's Player Y?</li>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I find your point worth responding to in specific. I find writing hard and rewarding. I also get paid for my writing. Many folks find designing a game hard and rewarding. They also get paid for their games, because they want money from you before they give you a copy. If I can get paid to write and they can get paid to design, why not get paid to GM?</blockquote>
I'm glad someone finally said this. Since when is something being rewarding or even easy a reason for it to be free? There are lots of things I do for money that are either not particularly difficult or which are particularly rewarding -- that's called 'having a good job,' not 'ripping someone off.' Working as a GM certainly seems to qualify as having a good job, so right on with that.                        </div>

Which segues to the thought I've been having.  There's something ginchy for me to about the idea of exchanging money for game.  And there is a flavor of prostitution about it.  But what about paying to have a game facilitated.  Player vetting, venue, snacks, pencils paper photocopies, dice.  And there is something about the way people treat an activity they're forking out for that's different - in both a good and a bad way.                        </div>

                            I feel that unease too, Judson, and I really do think it is the intersection of commerce with a deeply social exercise.  If my friends and I were to, say, pay for the services of an improv coach, there's an acknowledgement that we're receiving her wisdom and experience, and that can be easily qualified - but we aren't necessarily friends with her.  In fact it works much better if we aren't.  But gaming isn't normally heirarchical in that teacher-student way.  <br/><br/>I was about to write that gaming is different, that it is a social construct predicated on friendship, but of course that's not true.  Plenty of people rock out exclusively at RPGA events with strangers (and pay for the privilege).                        </div>

I feel similarly that I don't generally pay sight-unseen.  I have considered paying for certain larps (where it is fairly common for there to be a fee since there are location and other costs).  I was also tempted by <a href="http://www.behemoth3.com/otherworld/" rel="nofollow"><b>Otherworld Excursions</b></a>.  However, I didn't.  I also would consider doing <a href="http://www.roleplay-workshop.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>The Roleplay Workshop</b></a> for my son Milo as he gets older (but again, haven't).  <br/><br/>I have paid for conventions, which is essentially paying to play -- particularly at the local conventions where there is little except play that I couldn't otherwise get.  I guess I feel that there is a larger name at conventions.  I have paid for conventions in the past just to play in games which I didn't think were that great, but generally not multiple times.  <br/><br/>I guess I'd consider it if I saw some rave reviews.  I'm at a stage in life where I'll pretty easily drop $30 on dinner at a restaurant I"m not sure about -- so $12.50 for a game doesn't seem unreasonable.                        </div>

But there are ways to get out of that.  If it's really poor, you can walk away, demand your ticket back, etc.  Of course, most GMs don't see themselves as convention staff, so they might not cater to you if you did, say, demand your ticket back so you could get a refund.  But then if you're running the entire show, you're both GM and customer service.  But now I'm rambling.                        </div>

                            I also find the idea utterly laughable. We did talk about this concept only a couple of weeks ago but we decided that it was probably the sort of thing done by gamers who thought that starting pyramid schemes was passÃ©. The rate for my group, if you were the GM would be $250 a month for my group, not a bad wage for 4 nights work. I'm not going to make a moral judgement on it but I neither think it's something for "Story Games" nor do I think it's something I'd advocate. And if English is your first language, Elliot, then there's no way I'd pay. That's entirely a value judgement.<br/><br/>During the conversation last week, we did moot the idea that my players could bribe me. A quid ($2) for a random re-roll and two ($4) for a favourable result. And two again to cock up someone else's roll. And there would be a bidding system that would go up in increments. That beats the card based and stone/paper/scissors rubbish we've all been inventing over the last few years.                        </div>

                            Yes, I agree. Well, I think we're allowed to snark a bit because, you know, it's weird. But it's getting a bit much.<br/><br/>See, when I did improv, a similar thing happened. People would set themselves up as "improv teachers" or run "improv workshops" and charge for it: even though improv is something many people do for fun. <br/><br/>What happened was the bad ones (most of them) just failed. The few good ones kept going.<br/><br/>So I hope Elliott finds a way to make this work, actually. I don't think he will. But if he does, I'm sure as hell copying his business model.<br/><br/>By the way, Elliott, I like the new pricing structure. If I was ever in the Bay Area, I'd be tempted to give you ten bucks to see what it was like: frankly, to see if you were any good. <br/><br/>Perhaps not from 4pm to 6pm, though: if I gave you ten bucks, I'd want you to keep me entertained for the evening (so to speak). If it was 8pm to 10pm, with a trip to the bar afterwards, that would be better. But, like I say, I'm tempted.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

Pehaps from 4:00 to 7:00 or 5:00 to 8:00 and the possibility of dim sum afterwards (kickass dimsum place next door to Eudemonia.)  Thing is, I scheduled this so that... erm... elementary to high school students could get in on the fun too.                        </div>

Seconded! Constructive criticism is awesome and needed. Occasional bit of snark in small doses can be ok. But please, come on. The antagonism to something because it's non traditional is saddening.                        </div>

<p>So, Elliott, will you tell us how it goes? I for one am interested in your results.</p>
<p>Also, how are you selecting the games that the group plays? Do you give them like a menu of different game pitches, or do you do one game per season, or what? I think you could do some interesting (possibly not productive, but interesting-for-interesting's-sake) things with different structures here.</p>

                            The more we refuse to acknowledge that there are genuine skills involved in both running and playing our games, the greater disservice we do the hobby.

Yes, even of dirty hippy games. Fuck, some hippy games require enormous skill on the part of all players (including the GM), and can downright suck with less skilled players. <br/><br/>If Elliott's deal includes skill transfer (and that is part of being a good GM), why the hell shouldn't he charge for it?

I don't particularly care, since I'm on the East Coast.

1: Players come and go anyway.  I want to hold onto them until the end of a story arc, then if they want to hang around, so be it.  If not, I ask them to ask others to join.  Word of mouth will bless or damn my business.<br/><br/>2: First, there's a money back guarantee.  If they aren't satisfied, they get thier money back.  I hold onto it until the end of the session, ask if everyone's had fun, and if the answer is a less than resounding yes, I offer refunds.<br/><br/>Second - holding it in a public venue with the staff of the store watching my back (and knowing that I'm there) will keep me honest.  For the same reason, two players at least or the game is a no go.<br/><br/>Third - I can put down my good friend John Frankenhiem, professional GM, as a character reference.<br/><br/>3: At the moment, I will run anything as long as it's BESM.  Considering the multi-genre nature of BESM, that's... a pretty broad swath of stuff I can run.  After about a story arc (five to ten weeks,) I'll ask, "any other games you want me to run?" and offer suggestions.  The only thing I will reject outright is Dungeons and Dragons.<br/><br/>4: Actual Contract Oh Yes.  The contract will stipulate my responsibilities and thiers (among a few of the things in the contract: they pay me ahead of time or thier place in the adventure is not a given; fun will be had by all or those who do not have fun will get thier money back; this is how you set stakes; if confusion arises about the stakes, I will ask how or why you do something to scale the stakes up or down respectively: I say yes or you roll dice.)<br/><br/>5: Everyone tells me what they think is Fun and Why after each session.  They flag thier character sheets.  I take notes of when they're having a time with an awesome corona detectable from Rigel IV.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the answers.<br/><br/>What's your arrangement with the store?  Are they counting on increased business through your customers?  Do they get a kick-back?  It seems like they are assuming some liability, so there must be something they'll get out of it.  <br/><br/>Why exclude D&amp;D?  That seems like a counter-intuitive move, since many people already have some familiarity and would be more comfortable playing it.                        </div>

Pehaps from 4:00 to 7:00 or 5:00 to 8:00 and the possibility of dim sum afterwards (kickass dimsum place next door to Eudemonia.) Thing is, I scheduled this so that... erm... elementary to high school students could get in on the fun too.<br/><br/>I will say this outright. Adults or teenagers may very well object to players who are less than ten years old, and they very well may not be comfortable to say that this is something they do not enjoy.<br/><br/>I highly suggest you make a note as for ages in your notes for each specific story-arc, and that if it is open for all ages, say so in bold letters.                        </div>

You are charging far too little.<br/>
<br/>
You are an elite specialty babysitter; and yet you charge less than a teenybopper would.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if you're an above-par GM, you're charging adults too little as well.  Go-see what they pay their Pilates and Yoga instructor for private sessions.                        </div>

                            [For some reason , I can't quote properly right now, so...]<br/><br/>EB said:<br/>"At this point, I'm trying to attract players, not make lotsa cash.<br/><br/>I can always raise my prices. I need to start by establishing that this you pay for this, however little I am paid.<br/><br/>If however charging more would HELP my image, then so be it!" <br/><br/>Weirdly, one of the arguments I have seen bandied around on boards for some time is that rpgs are horribly under-priced. A related argument is that because they are low-priced, they aren't "status" items.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that charging more would directly help you personally at this point ( and probably would hurt your chances), it might actually help the hobby as a whole if this becomes established as acceptable.                        </div>

                            Brand,<br/><br/>In answer to your question upthread, I didn't say that one shouldn't get paid, I said I thought traditional GMing wasn't hard.  I then went on to say that if it was hard, it was rewarding hard.<br/><br/>But that was in a context, I was responding to a specific quoted post which seemed to suggest that the fact that traditional GMing was hard (which I question) in and of itself meant it merited payment.  I wasn't making a more general point, simply that I don't think it follows that traditional GMing (whatever that is) is hard in a way that in and of itself merits payment.<br/><br/>Clearly my post wasn't as clear as I thought, as everyone picked up on my comment but not on the fact it was in the context of responding to a specific quoted remark upthread.  There wasn't the general point I think a lot of folk read in, rather I was responding to what I thought was an inaccurate perception of traditional GMing and its difficulty.  It was if anything a tangent to this thread.<br/><br/>I don't see a moral dimension to all this, if this chap can get paid for his efforts then fair enough, that said I don't think it's an especially positive development for the hobby as I think it prioritises the importance of the GM over the players and raises a number of other issues already discussed upthread, but that's why I wouldn't personally participate.  It doesn't mean I don't think others can do it or that they are somehow bad people for doing so, just that I wouldn't personally.<br/><br/>Hell, I wish EB every success.  If he can make this work then fair play to him.                        </div>

<blockquote>See, when I did improv, a similar thing happened. People would set themselves up as "improv teachers" or run "improv workshops" and charge for it: even though improv is something many people do for fun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I'm essentially asking for money to organize a game, <b>teach valuable creative and storytelling techniques</b>, and create a cool world and antagonists for the players characters to make awesome from. (Emphasis mine)</blockquote>
That's what's missing from the advert and the OP, then -- while for my part I would never want to pay or charge for game-mastering, I would indeed consider paying this amount and more for good GMing seminars or workshops that came with a recommendation from someone I trust.  Naturally, I would expext something different from just sitting in a game, munching on the snacks, killing monsters and taking their stuff.  For example, I would expect a briefing and debriefing, discussion and demonstration of specific techniques, prepared handouts, some group and individual exercises, group critique, etc.  The game would essentially be a demo or practicum and occupy maybe half or a third of the total time.                        </div>

                            Wow, three pages of this conversation.  Impressive <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Anyway my two cents is this:<br/>1.  I considered doing this a few times and to a certain extent did when I ran a game store.  I either charged enough to cover two books and a "winner" or two would get copies of the book after the demo OR I would just have a short campaign with me be incentive to purchase product.<br/><br/>2.  I don't think it's wrong to have Elliot post any sort of service unless it wasn't in Directed promotions.  I mean I don't see any difference between that and shilling our RPG products here.  Although I question whether this is really his target market.  Most folk that are willing to pay for a GM (as many have mentioned) are not among us.  And I suspect those that would here are doing it for either curiosity or to see if they can jump on the bandwagon.  <br/><br/>3.  That being said I think this sort of thing works just fine in certain environments.  A SG GM bringing the awesomeness to the masses is really keen and I get a feelinging of "teach a man to fish" going on there.  And if there is a shortage of good GMs or a high demand for good GMs in an area then I don't think this is a bad idea at all.  The problem is that if some cynical bastard like me heard this in my area I would post followup ads saying I will run the game for free and do it better <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I will be checking out the Livejournal to see how it's going.  Good luck Elliot.<br/>- Don                        </div>

                            Sophie says it better than I did. If it's actually a professional seminar, no big deal. One of the things that detracts from that feel, interestingly, is the snacks. Especially presented as snacks. That makes it feel like you're saying, "Come on, let's be friends like you had back in high school - we'll hang out and I'll bring the snacks!"<br/>
<br/>
This could be a Bay Area thing, too. If you said something like "Luncheon included" (don't make it optional, just include it in the price), that comes off as more professional.<br/>
<br/>
It's the same thing, however. It's maintaining the right social context expectations for everybody. You're charging money, so while doing so, you're going to be something other than a friend, socially. If you make that clear, and conduct yourself in this fashion (including Sophie's suggestion of formal brief/debrief, etc.), then I think it'll be functional.<br/>

                            Elliot, you're offering way too many options, from reading your LJ. Optional meals and half-rates and a few other optional exceptions.<br><br>Also, meals for $2.50? Unless we're talking white pasta or bologna sandwhiches, how is this possible? I mean, when I see "meal" and "$2.50" in the same sentence, it makes me VERY skeptical about whether I'll get good food.                        </br></br></div>

Hmmn.<br><br>joepub,<br/><br/>Updating my journal tonight:  in disucussion with my friends, I upped the meal price to $5.00.  I'll probably make it included in the price, so it's $15.00 for a seminar, game, and meal.<br/><br/>Edited to add: UPDATED.  New info includes that these are LESSONS as well as games, that it costs $15 dollars for the lesson and meal ($70 for five sessions), and a choice of settings.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
