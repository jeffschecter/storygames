The boasting was quite a bit of fun, but the game seemed to break down at times.<br/><br/>*One player won on the first turn the first time we played.  Truly, he was without peer.<br/><br/>*The game after that, we tended to get 'locked up' quite a bit.<br/><br/>We had a number of players who could only start wars they knew they would loose.  For example, they would have Bronze King and Bronze Army, and a Blood God.  All the other Kings on the board would be Bronze, the only Blood Army would be Without Peer, and the only Bronze God would be Without Peer.  Very frustrating.<br/><br/>With four players, the negotiation of alliances didn't seem to be complex enough.  We'd basically end up with "these two guys ally, so these other two guys ally."<br/><br/>I think both these problems would go away with more players, but I was curious as to others experiences.  What's up?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124543/#Comment_124543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T09:35:36+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  9:35AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2008 9:36AM by blankshield.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Willow, sorry I missed this when it first showed up; I skim Story Games and sometimes things don't hit my radar.<br/><br/>Four players is the low end, and requires more attention to the shape of the game; 5 and 6 players gives some more leeway, and the game can run with more, but tends to breakdown in the other direction: you can do pretty much anything, and it becomes too hard to collect Without Peers.  A couple questions:<br/><br/>Did you have people making written agreements a lot, or mostly going through the plotting phase without anything committed?  The written agreements (and subsequent betrayal/loyalty chances) are key to breaking locks, as is winning wars when you're Without Peer.  (edit: also, were people remembering that they don't have to start a war, as long as they're willing to put up with mockery?)<br/><br/>How fluid were the alliances?  Was it always the same pairings, or did people shift around?  If there was a clear 2-on-1 situation, why was the last player stepping in on the losing side?<br/><br/>The game won on the first round; how many Without Peers did the winning player end up with out of the bidding?  Also, was it a "how the heck did that happen?" kind of win, or a "Holy cow, X kicked our asses before we even knew we were in a fight" kind of win?<br/><br/>How many people came out of the bidding without tokens in 2 arenas?  <br/><br/>thanks,<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
