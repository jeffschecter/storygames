                    I was talking with my wife Lisa about my story game in development, Saga, over the weekend. She's part of my target audience, as she's both a writer and a long-time freeform player.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as it currently stands, in Saga you create a conflict web and link up characters around a core conflict (obviously based on Ron's relationship map work and Chris Chinn's conflict web article). It allows and encourages people to create and link characters on all sides of the conflict. The links can be positive (love, duty) or negative (hatred, jealousy), but they must be strong emotional links.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa saw a problem with the approach, because she doesn't think most people will be able to separate out the sides the characters are on, won't be able to push the conflict as hard, and won't be as invested in the outcome of conflicts, because they have characters on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we've agreed to playtest it sometime soon and figure out how it works for us, but I wanted to pose this question to you guys and see what you think.<br/>
<br/>
If you need an example, let's say your core conflict is the question of who will succeed the dead king on the throne; you have an older and a younger brother and maybe even a third party, such as a bastard child. Now, a player could have a character who's the older brother, but then also one who's the advisor to the younger brother, or the mother of the bastard child.<br/>
<br/>
My idea was that this way, they can play among each other as well as against each other, i.e., you can roleplay out a scene between the advisor and the brother, and then also a conflict between both brothers.<br/>
<br/>
So--having characters on all sides of a conflict. What are the good points? What are the bad? What is your experience with that, your expectation, and your view on most people's ability to play that way?                </div>

                            Good Points: You develop a more whole, complete story. Also, the antagonists become more realistic and perhaps even sympathizable (is that a word?).<br/><br/>Bad Points: You lose "Immersion" when you pull off the character-glasses and look from the top-down at the situation. <br/><br/>Experiences: My Thursday group, which is basically a group of friends that meet weekly to talk about science, bitch about politics, and Oh Yeah Game (about as casual as casual can be) really got invested in our Shock: Social Science Fiction game in a big way. They did say that they prefer "regular gaming" more, because that's what they're used to, but did roll well with it, and we used some of those techniques for some of our TSOY fantasy since.<br/><br/>Anyone who can hold their own in a polite, friendly social debate will have no problem playing that way.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p>Well, all I can offer is my own preferance here.  Which may be about as useful as coming in and shouting "I like chocolate!", but here it is anyway.</p>
<p>When I have more than one character under my narrative control I don't mind if those characters are in conflict with one another.  It can be kinda interesting.  What I don't like is trying to take up more than one position in mechanical conflict resolution.  I may think it'll be pretty cool no matter who wins the conflict, but I enjoy taking a side and throwing my resources in on that side.  Also, when I take a side in a conflict that's going to play out in the mechanisms of the game, I only find it entertaining if there's another player who's willing to take up an opposing position.</p>
<p>So, if Omar and Jerub are fictional characters in the game, characters who are in conflict, and I'm in control of both of them, I'm going to prolong their conflict for the entertainment of the other players at the table.  Probably never resolving that conflict.  However, if Jason, a player, jumps up and says that one character or the other should win, then I can promise you that I'll be more than happy to take up an opposing position.  That position may be that I think the other side should win the conflict, or my position may be that the conflict should remain unresolved.  Whichever seems interesting to me and, at the same time, opposes Jason's position.</p>
<p>Because that's where I find <em>my</em> entertainment.</p>
<p>I like chocolate!</p>

                            This came up yesterday as we were playtesting AG&amp;G, Vincent's new game.  A similar conflict-web-like-structure is built, and you choose roles.  We very consciously steered toward opposition, but it's possible to build up conflicts in which you have a vested interest in both sides.  <br/><br/>Personally I don't think it is a big deal.  I've seen it come up in The Roach plenty of times, and as long as everybody is open, communicative and trusting it is never a problem to be playing both sides to some degree.                        </div>

                            In my experience with this (admittedly limited), it seems to work okay as long as the motivations for the characters on different sides of the conflict come from a different emotional place.  So, for example, I have yet to meet anyone who could play two brothers both feuding for the throne, both of whom want it because they are proud and hate their sibling.  It just becomes difficult to keep the character motivations distinct.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, I'm playing characters who are on opposite sides of a conflict, but who are really about very different things, it becomes much less hard.  For example, if I'm playing a prince vying for the throne because I am proud and hate my sibling, I could also play the advisor to another candidate, who is in love with his candidate and wants her to succeed and is terrified of her death, and also the mother of a third candidate, who just cares about her descendants being on that throne, through murder or marriage or whatever means necessary.  This way I've got conflict between the characters' stories, but I'm coming at each side of it from a very different place.  As a player, I can really get involved in each different emotional arc as it comes up, without worrying that I'm stepping on one character's toes with another.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Thanks for the input, guys. The actual conflict resolution will always be between two characters controlled by two different players; they can draw on the traits of linked characters in group conflicts, so your minor character could help out your opponent against your major character, but you don't actually have to be the main actor for both sides.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that playing will show that there might be some immersion issues, as Andy says, but that it won't ruin the fun of the game. By having a discrete scene structure where you can focus on playing one character at a time, I'm hoping that the effect will be alleviated.                        </div>

1. Yeah, having characters in all sorts of places within a conflict web can be fun.<br/>
<br/>
2. One of the rules derived from the "Gaming is a dialogue, not a monologue" rule is that "The player who presents a problem should not also solve this problem".  How this translates to explicit conflict mechanics is interesting.                        </div>

                            Another thing that can help, Christian, is if those different characters' goals are all related to that uber-conflict but are in fact different.  To take Jess's examples, if the prince wants to protect his people, the advisor wants to see his lover safe and able to shine, and the mother wants to see her son rise to the throne, what you're really talking about is a handful of different personal conflicts that relate to one big political conflict.  That, and it's perfectly possible that more than one character can 'win' even if it's not the win of taking the throne (the prince protects his people by putting the bastard on the throne in an agreement negotiated by the advisor's lover, for instance).                        </div>

                            Quick note - you might gain some benefit from renting or buying Indigo Prophecy, a computer game in which (at the beginning at least), you play both a man who may be a killer (or a victim of demonic possession) and the police officers looking for him. However, you don't get to play out every action of either one - if you choose to hide the murder weapon, for example, you don't get to see exactly where the character hid it, making looking for it a little more complicated when you play the police officer. If the killer sneaks out, the waitress can't give a good description to the officer, and so on.  Interesting stuff. (The game takes a crazy turn about halfway through - I enjoyed it after that but it was a very different thing.)                        </div>

Yes, I think that's an important rule. isn't that the Czege principle or something? :) For any given conflict, you shouldn't represent both sides, but the issue is that you might have to make a decision about one of your characters helping the other player against another of your characters.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
Jess and you are both right. The primary actors in the game will have Driving Passions that directly represent this sort of thing: their motivation and reason for doing something, as well as their motor for pushing onward. I think I need to play and see how those work out with/against each other.<br/>
<br/>
JD,<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can find it, thanks for the recommendation. I do think switching gears like that might be tough for many people, because what was your goal in one scene suddenly changes to the opposite. But then again, anyone writing a dramatic story needs to do this for all the characters as well, so it's a good thing to practice.                        </div>
