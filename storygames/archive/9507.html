Pretty cool game. <br/><br/>In Kagematsu you play the women of a feudal Japanese village where all the men have left to go to war. As a new threat looms over your village, signaling certain doom, a roaming Samurai with a troubled past enters the scene. Kagematsu. And you will be damned if he doesn\u2019t help you. Your goal is to win Kagematsu\u2019s affections and guarantee a promise from him to defend the village. <br/><br/>The game is played out in 3 phases. The courtship, confrontation, and conclusion. If the courtship, you attempt to seduce Kagematsu. To do so, you slowly try to win his affection with stolen glances, smiles, kind words, shared moments, secrets, touches, gifts, kisses, confessions of love, sex, and promises. <br/><br/>The game has an interesting tactical component. Winning a smile is easier than winning a kiss. And as you win more and more affection, you can keep trying for more at the risk of losing everything you gained on your turn. <br/><br/>Additionally, if you fail at gaining a specific affection, you may only try again out of desperation. Threats, disdain, begging, questioning honor, challenging manhood, accusations of impropriety, ransoms, blackmail, and threats of suicide. <br/><br/>It was absolutely hilarious when one of the players was able to have sex with Kagematsu but couldn\u2019t win a kiss! <br/><br/>One of my favorite parts was as the players try to gain Kagematsu\u2019s affection, Kagematsu secretly notes if the affection was gained out of pity or love (completely based on roleplaying as interpreted by the player playing Kagematsu). Love makes gaining future affections easier. <br/><br/>The courtship phase ends once someone has won a promise from Kagematsu to defend the village. You then play out the defense in the confrontation phase which is ranges in difficulty based on how fearful the player characters are when the confrontation finally comes (which is based on how many affections you gained)<br/><br/>Fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210865/#Comment_210865" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T07:23:00+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  7:23AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran this game for John and four other players from western Mass at JiffyCon this weekend.  Everyone enjoyed the game, and one player was inspired to run it in the fall at another local con. I made some big mistakes though in running it, which I am just glad didn't screw it up for the players.  They were:<br/><br/><b>Desperations</b><br/>As John said, the women of the village try to gain Affections from the Samurai.  If you fail, you can follow up with acts of Desperation to further dice to roll toward gaining the Samurai's favor.  The Desperations are thematically linked to each Affection (The affection "roll in the hay" is paired with "tell Kagematsu he's the father of your child"), and you can only use a given Desperation once you have at least tried for it's matching Affection. <br/><br/>You can use as many Desperations as you want in a given try, but if you roll for a Desperation and it doesn't tip you over to success, you have to mark that one off, and you can never do it again. This is where my bit mistake came in, I forgot to have people X them off as they went, so they ended up having more free Desperations than they should have. I realized my error halfway through the game, but still this made it much easier on them than it should have been.<br/><br/><b>Fear levels</b><br/>Also, we had 6 players in the game. The number of players affects the level of Fear that the Women start off with. Their Fear goes down as they successfully gain Affections, and the final totals of their fear equal the number of dice that get rolled agains Kagematsu in the final confrontation with the looming threat.  The suggested starting Fear level for 4 players was 8, and I had more players, so I tapped it down to 7. This may have been too low. Especially since they had extra Desperations to call on. <br/><br/>At the end, the highest fear levels were 1, a few of us had fear of 0.  Kagematsu won, definitively. It was great to get a happy ending--Kagematsu ended up marrying the owner of a tea house in town, who had offered him her beloved tea house in order to get him to promise to fight the bandits that were menacing the town.  I had the Kagematsu not say anything out the relative outcome until all of us had given our narration of how we helped, so the tension was maintained for us all. But the relative numbers of dice really made it much less of a nail-biter than I think it is intended to be. I also wondered if your fear is 0, how should that be handled?<br/><br/>It's a great game, Danielle. I'd like to run it again, now that I have it straight in my head. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> And I'm looking forward to seeing how it goes for Kim, the player who wants to run it too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210867/#Comment_210867" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T07:29:55+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  7:29AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the set-up for Kagematsu and it sounds like a game I'd enjoy.

They often play the GM as much as they play the game. <br/><br/>Kagematsu does not have a GM but Kagematsu\u2019s player is in every scene and evaluates everyone else\u2019s roleplaying (was Kagematsu affectionate out of love or pity). So effectively they take the place of the GM above. <br/><br/>The players are trying to seduce Kagematsu mechanically and trying to sway the \u201cGM\u201d to interpret their seduction as love vs. pity via freeform roleplaying. Who plays Kagematsu is going to drastically change how people socially try to obtain their goals. Speaking very generally, I think having a woman play Kagematsu in a mostly male group is a good fit as it raises awareness and sensitivity. <br/><br/>Conversely, I feel having a man play Kagematsu in a mostly female group could also work. But there are also so many other factors that shake things including maturity, sexual preference, real life relationships, a person\u2019s style of play, as well as how feminine or masculine someone is regardless of their gender. <br/><br/>Our group consisted of 4 women and 2 men. No idea about sexual preference or experience. And I didn\u2019t know most of the players. I found Kagematsu was played neutrally. While the villagers ranged in behavior and attitude widely, especially as they grew more desperate.  <br/><br/>I\u2019m curious to see how it would play out if there were more affection options that strongly advocated connecting with Kagematsu intellectually, aesthetically, or skillfully. Certainly affections such as \u201cmaking a lasting impression\u201d could easily fall into these categories but didn\u2019t seem to (I suspect since so many of the affections were strongly based in seductive or physical actions). But this also might be due to the pressure of the time running out as the outside threat looms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210948/#Comment_210948" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T13:01:54+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  1:01PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this game available for purchase or playtest?

It is a really great game which is why I wanted to develop it. As for mistakes...eh. Everyone had dramatic scenes, right? There were tense moments when rolling desperations, right? Everyone had fun and that's what matters. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe amout of Fear for 5 players was a  tough call, but I probably would have done the same. I think that having 4 townswomen is the limit not just for the Fear dice, but the time length of the game. I want all players to get some screen time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, thanks for playing and posting a summary of gameplay. I'm glad that you had a good time. Keeping the rolls and scoring a secret is one of my favorite things about the game too, lots of people like it. The final version will come with a retro/old school player screen (!) smartly suggested by Anna Kreider. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving Kagematsu played by a woman was the central feature of the game when it was originally conceived. I'm going to quote SR Knipe from the back of the ashcan and how it relates to her rational for the game. "I wanted to put a woman in a position to judge the rightness and wrongness of every other character's actions, thereby 'teaching' us (about love, as it turns out)." <br/>\n<br/>\nWhile everyone who plays the character Kagematsu will have different histories, maturity levels and style of play, I don't think that having a male K'su player would be the same as a woman. For example, women have a completely different emotional reaction than men playing a first person shooter computer game. Men just whip around the camera and spout vile words while killing aliens. When women play something like that, we shreak a bit while we swerve and shoot the gun. Why? Because we have a subconscious, negative instinctive reaction to being chased and caught from behind. It's very creepy, preying on all your fears and what all those virus emails tell you about kidnapped women and how to protect yourself. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a theory that My Life with Master would be a very different game with all female players. We cause hurt in different ways than men. Men punch and cause black eyes; women tear out hair and earrings, quite bloody. But enough about gender... the fact is that no one judges Love equally. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to John's point about the affections being more intellectual or aesthetic, that is totally possible with some of the affections. At one point at Camp Nerdly three or all four of us tried the same affection pretty close together and we each did it in different ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is really interested in getting the ashcan, I have copies available and I will happily provide the confrontation rules change. I intend to have the final version with a bit more in the history section, some additional items in the appendix and the before mentioned players screen. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's some questions to Emily, John or any other players.<br/>\n-Were the scenes naturally short or did they need to be wrangled?<br/>\n-Who played K'su? <br/>\n-Were the scenes all set up by K'su or did the townswomen set them like at Nerdly?<br/>\n-No one mentioned what the Threat was! What was it and how was the scene rotation during the confrontation?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDanielle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211053/#Comment_211053" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T07:28:31+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  7:28AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Danielle,</p>\n<p>Something from John's play summary struck me as odd.</p>\n<p>Now that you're eliminating Fear (as opposed to accruing Hope), the possibility of a guaranteed villager victory during the Confrontation is real.</p>\n<p>That smacks of being not fun.<br/>\nD</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211056/#Comment_211056" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T07:36:08+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  7:36AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            -Were the scenes naturally short or did they need to be wrangled?<br/>\nThey felt naturally short to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Were the scenes all set up by K'su or did the townswomen set them like at Nerdly?<br/>\nThe townswomen set the scenes up.

It was what I told everyone they could do, and which I believe is how it's described in the rules. You have a choice about what you say: either what the women do, or what the threat do. If it felt confused, that's interesting. I think we just could have used more of the threat overall! (see below about that)<br><br><br><b>-Were the scenes naturally short or did they need to be wrangled?</b><br>The scenes seemed like a good length to me. Some were quite short. Some longer. The player of Kagematsu jumped right in saying "okay, we need to roll for me to know how to respond to that" many times.<br><br><b>-Who played K'su?</b><br>A woman from our area named Kim. She had never heard of the game before, and I think, is pretty new to indie gaming. She liked it so much she is going to run it at a con in September.<br/><br/><b>-Were the scenes all set up by K'su or did the townswomen set them like at Nerdly?</b><br/>As John said above, the players of the women framed them all. We did have Kagematsu set the scene at the end of each round, however, which gave us some events to play with. Though, that wasn't always followed up on in a strong way. In fact I may have been allowing the Women players too much narrative control. They were framing Kage into scenes. It would give the Kagematsu player more centrality to do that instead.<br/><br/><b>-No one mentioned what the Threat was! What was it and how was the scene rotation during the confrontation?</b><br/>John described it above. Again, we had very little interaction with the Threat during the game.  This time we never once rolled 3 sixes, though we had many turns where people had to use their Desperations, so rolled lots of dice. Though, since the Fear was low, people didn't have to roll against the high dice values as much. Definitely a higher ceiling for Fear seems like a good idea. <br/><br/>An idea that people gave at the end of the game was to have the Threat have to increase regularly. I kept wishing that the Kagematsu player would describe it encroaching at the start of each round.<br/><br/>Another suggestion people had about the Desperations was to have each one rolled have a -1 to the value. And for you to have to stop if you ever roll a 1. Having played in a game where it was much bleaker, and where the Desperations were much thinner on the ground, I don't thin, this is necessary, but it's a neat suggestion.<br/><br/>More feedback that everybody gave was for the game text to have lists or more information about the local period.  They all said they'd like to have had a list of typical occupations, activities, locations, and so on to choose from or look at to inspire their characters. They all liked when things from the period affected the game, and all felt they'd have benefitted from more real world specifics to ground their play in.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielleLewon" title="DanielleLewon"><img alt="DanielleLewon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielleLewon">DanielleLewon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211706/#Comment_211706" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T14:11:58+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  2:11PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 2:14PM by DanielleLewon.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darcy, because of the situation with Emily's game (unlimited desperations) it went really really well. In the 2 full games that I have played with the Fear rules, it was not a guaranteed win but it was fun. I was getting worried that it would always end in ruin. It was too easy for the Jiffy players, but I hope it was fun. I understand the idea of the -1 desperation, but I hope that is not needed. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn reflection of the Fear starting score, I think a '4 or more players start at 8' might solve the what to do issue. Paul has suggested running through some numbers to test it, and I will. <br/>\n<br/>\nScenes are supposed to be short when the players make them short. That's cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene framing issue is not new. Some K'su players feel a bit overwhelmed to come up with scene after scene while the women players feel like they are not contributing enough. Or instead of asking for an affection, they started a scene telling Kagematsu what he was doing. I don't like that either. A lot of the game allows Kagematsu to make the final decision about something, is it enough to say he decides who frames the next scene? Let him have control over it, since he is the man... so to speak...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am REALLY surprised that no one rolled 3 sixes! With 5 players and all that dice, very surprised. It is supposed to happen once or twice during a game. We had it twice an Nerdly. It was either an anomaly or the desperation dice were re-rolled instead of adding a new die to the pile. Emily? <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, the additional information about jobs and culture, I know it is needed and I am working on it as we speak. The history/setting section will have more provocative text and there will be a section on village life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!<br/>\n-Danielle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
