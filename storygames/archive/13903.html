It is the one thing i never got a good response for when i asked more experienced designers for help.<br/><br/>That said I have been doing it for a while, and have started to feel comfortable with it. I generally have to write a paragraph of ad copy for every project I do. I started this habit because for years when I was pitching board games to publishers that pitch paragraph is what they want first. So your game lives or dies based on this first impression.<br/><br/>looking at this paragraph pitch it falls into a simple formula <br/><br/>First sentience "the hook"<br/>This should end with an question mark and give just enough info so they read the whole thing.<br/><br/>Second sentience "the idea"<br/>In as few words as possible tell people what the thing is. a second idea sentience can also fit but be econamic with the word count<br/><br/>Third sentence "the take away"<br/>give people a reason to want what you have<br/><br/>Here is an example pitch paragraph for my chess variant BSChess<br/><br/>"Did they really move a knight or is it a pawn pretending? In<br/>this chess game of hidden identities it\u2019s your call!

Because if it's a poor match, even if the pitch persuaded them to try, once they realize the mismatch they will stop playing and you may hurt your credibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I don't know what my friends want, I will ask them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the game matches what they want, or if they are open to new experiences, I will pitch the game\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n- as briefly as possible<br/>\n- focusing on what they get out of it<br/>\n- explaining why its different<br/>\n- explaining what problem it solves*<br/>\n- explaining who this is not for**<br/>\n- help them imagine what it is like to play, as if we were playing right now***<br/>\n- end with what we need to do next to make this happen<br/>\n- make the next step as easy as possible (fast, no commitment)<br/>\n- and be enthusiastic every step of the way<br/>\n<br/>\n*When I say "problem", I mean a real problem the person I am speaking to thinks they have. Telling them that your game fixes the terrible whiffing in D&amp;D; when they love D&amp;D; and think that's a feature\u2026 that's you projecting your tastes on someone else. Instead, find out what problems they actually have and want to do something about and then offer solutions you think will actually help. <b>Don't try to convince people they have a problem they don't have so you can sell them a solution.</b><br/>\n<br/>\n**Explaining who this is not for gives someone an easy out. If they aren't interested at this point, they can simply say at that point, "not for me" and you can stop wasting their time. Added bonus\u2026 saying who it is not for is another way of saying who it is for.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Help them imagine what it is like to play by asking questions. Start with limited answers. Who would you play? A Fighter, Wizard, Cleric, or Thief? Then describe why you are awesome, where you are, your goal, what happens if you fail, and the awe inspiring obstacle that's stopping you as time runs out\u2026 what do you do? Except don't answer that question. That's what the game is for!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also ways to play with language, emphasis, order of words, speech patterns, and body language that can make you more persuasive but I don't want to use persuasiveness to trick people into wanting something they don't. That sucks. And it's short sighted for many reasons. I'd rather work hard at being the best match maker I can be. Keep your own bias at check while focusing on identifying real problems and then offering real solutions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315070/#Comment_315070" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-02T05:06:33+00:00" title="March  2, 2011  5:06AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get together with a group of board gamers once a month or so. We play several board games in a day. We hold a sort of negociation about what we'll play. We say what we've brought. A big part of the "sale" is the name of the game, how many people can play and how long it takes. Given that my long games don't have to take more than two hours (and some are just one) I have an easier time selling it. There just isn't as much buy in cost.<br><br>RPGs are different. It is a game that at the very least (in a con setting) will last 4 hours and in a normal setting will take up potentially weeks or months of play time. A big buy in cost. For years I didn't ask people locally to play my games because it would make them eternally play testers (which is frustrating to people). I think I didn't think they were worth the buy in. Now I'm more confident - but - I still don't want to be seen as dominating group choice. <br><br>I know from selling games for cash that you have to believe that what you are suggesting is good. If they decide to play they will get something special. It will in no way hurt them. If they don't choose it then it is not personal. They just don't want to play that game - it's not about not liking me. These are the things I tell myself - so I hopefully believe them! They do build up my courage.<br><br>So... Through your hat in the ring. Say "I'd like to play Mouse Guard. It's a fantasy game where the players are heroic mice facing down evil serpents. Think Red Shield. What do you think?" Say it with confidence and a smile on your face and be prepared to have a counter-offer come up. Which games we play is a negociation so if you don't get it this time - maybe they will agree that that will be the next game.<br><br>Chris Engle                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315072/#Comment_315072" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-02T05:14:52+00:00" title="March  2, 2011  5:14AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty good at pitching things in writing.

I tried writing a half-dozen, based on some ideas from this thread &amp; elsewhere, and got some friends to vote on the ones that made them most want to play a game.<br/><br/>The results were pretty interesting. 17 people voted. The most popular pitch got 9 votes, the least popular only 1. Here are the results (the numbers are votes):\n<blockquote>9: Will you destroy the mnemosite - or let it look into your soul? As one of the Society of Dreamers, the choice is yours. When you understand the true nature of these dream creatures, there is no simple answer. When the antagonist arises from your own mind... how will you face it?<br/><br/>8: What strange creatures live in our dreams? In this game, you are a member of the secret Society of Dreamers, hunting for the mnemosites that hide in the nightly visions of mankind. Every scene reveals more - until the final confrontation.<br/><br/>7: What reality do you live in? Dive into a surrealist, opium-spiked vision of the 19th century. Live the life of the Society of Dreamers. And try, if you can, to keep a grip on reality... and on your dreams.<br/><br/>4: A game of dreams, insanity and death.<br/><br/>2: See your dreams! Using ritual and mystic techniques, this game will let you and your friends experience shared dream stories, taking you to the 19th century to be part of the mystical Society of Dreamers. But what lives in the world of dreams...? <br/><br/>1: Where will your mind lead you? In this cooperative story game, you will experience a surreal atmosphere as the mystery of the dream Mnemosites unfolds.</blockquote>\nSo from this very small sample from the Norwegian hard core, it looks like:<br/><br/>- Tyler's formula - hook question first - is definitely the way to go.<br/>- Starting and ending with a choice for the players is possibly double cool.<br/>- Evoking the setting is very good. (I got some positive responses on the "surrealist, opium-spiked vision of the 19th century").<br/>- The words "cooperative story game" don't excite anyone.<br/>- Don't put the players in the back seat - "you will experience blabla as this and this happens" sounds like the game plays itself while you sit on the couch.<br/>- Don't bother mentioning techniques in your pitch. <br/>- Keep it short, but not too short.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315561/#Comment_315561" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-05T08:02:39+00:00" title="March  5, 2011  8:02AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, Matthijs!<br/><br/>I would probably rank those pitches in a similar order, but the one thing that really jumped out at me was, indeed, "surrealist, opium-spiked vision of the 19th century."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
