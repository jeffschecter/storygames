                    Hey, team.  I'm Matt.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how terminology has shifted since the Forge days (and I get the sense, from lurking over the past few months, that terminology is much less of a big deal in this space), but there's that thing that once was called Director stance.  Maybe now it's just "story gaminess".  I, the player, influence our game not through the abilities of my character, but through things I personally would like to see happen.<br/><br/>Everybody knows what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>There are "trad" games that offer this, with Bennies, Fate Points, etc.  These Meta-Points (MP, for brevity) are, in my experience, doled out sparingly and pretty tightly curtailed.   Get a reroll, or a minor plot declaration ("Yes, there is an awning that could catch you.").  <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Ok, here's the deal.<br/><br/>All the time (by which I mean often) in the stories we love best in film or fiction, there are characters of differing efficacies running around together.  Batman + Robin.  Aragorn + Pippin.  Obi-Wan + Luke.  Indy + Short Round.  Superman + Batman.<br/><br/>To make this fun in-game, it's no good beefing up Robin.  Then he's Nightwing and we've missed the point.  Let's do this, instead: <br/>Batman is a bad mofo and has huge Str and Dex.  And few MP.  <br/>Robin is pretty puny, but has a ton of MP.<br/><br/>Sounds good so far.<br/>BUT.<br/>If Robin has 12 MP, and the best he can do is get rerolls or the occasional chandelier, that still sucks.  With 12 MP, the player should be able to really play an active role in guiding the game.  Cool!  Eh, wait, what <i>can</i> you do with 12 MP?<br/><br/>This, I imagine, will require some delicacy to balance.  I have some ideas, but I'm wondering what's out there already that I'm not aware of.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Question:<br/><br/>Can anybody throw me some suggestions here, games where the MPs can be spent in a ton of ways, with differing costs for different effects?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>

                            With flashy powers in mind, I'd say Anima Prime is something like this. There's a great variety in MP economy. It felt a bit like MP Champions to me.<br/>As a side note, I say : if you make Batman and Robin all MP, giving the shrewder player Robin, you'll save yourself a lot of scaling and balancing nonsense trouble.                         </div>

                            Playing or designing games where a duo (or larger group) of "unbalanced" protagonists (as far as their diegetic "power level" is concerned) are balanced in terms of their contribution to the game is a great idea. As you write, there is lots of fiction like this.<br/><br/>I think that simply thinking in terms of "points you can spend for effects" is a limited way to look at it, however.<br/><br/>One of my favourite examples is the Mortal in Monsterhearts. Unlike the other characters, you have less fictional "power" - you're not a monster, you have no supernatural strengths, and so on - but your particular character's design makes you magnetic, important. You may be a victim, but you're the most interesting and popular victim: the game pushes you to make yourself vulnerable, but, in the process, you become the center of attention.<br/><br/>The Mortal doesn't have any special "director stance" powers (ability for the player to directly influence events outside the reach of their character's particular fictional means), but either rewards or is rewarded when other characters take advantage of them, which incentivizes everyone to do so on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Here's an example of what that might look like in your hypothetical Batman &amp; Robin game, for a super simple illustration:<br/><br/>* Batman has powerful stats and can really kick ass.<br/><br/>* Robin cannot, not to the same extent.<br/><br/>However, Robin has emotional sway over Batman, and maybe some clever insight.<br/><br/>The rule is:<br/><br/>Whenever Batman follows Robin's plans or ideas - acts according to what Robin wants - he gets +3 to his rolls. (And maybe Robin scores XP every time this happens, or some such.)<br/><br/>If the opposition is dangerous enough that Batman really *needs* that +3 bonus, you're going to get a very interesting power dynamic happening between the two. Robin needs Batman's help and protection, but Batman needs to ask Robin for advice before acting (and then do as he says) or he's likely to fail.<br/><br/>I think that's a fair bit more interesting than simply having more points to spend for "director powers". <br/><br/>Another example:<br/><br/>Batman is the strong one, as before. However, the plots we face are all about the sidekick (Robin). Each "adventure" starts with Robin telling us about some of his fears, and what he treasures most. The GM (or whoever portrays the opposition) now creates threats and dangers based on those fears.<br/><br/>Now we get a game where Batman is the mechanically effective one, but every story we play out is effectively <i>about Robin</i>. (And, in a sense, Robin's player is exercising some creative authority in inspiring and defining the scope of the dangers and bad guys they deal with.)<br/><br/>In short, I'd be looking for ways to create synergy between the two characters, so that they need to interact with each other in order to get what they want.                        </div>

                            I seem to remember that the Buffy the Vampire Slayer game used this kind of mechanism to balance the powerhouse characters (Slayer, vampires, werewolves, etc.) with the normal high school students who made up the rest of the player group. I don't remember whether the MP-equivalent was useful for Director-stance stuff or if it was more limited to things like re-rolls or plusses to ability checks.                        </div>

                            What actual storytelling usually does is that the weaker character is put into a position of responsibility due to the stronger character being otherwise occupied. I guess you could buy this with hero points (literally buy a bigger threat for Batman to fight so Robin gets to solve the problem at hand), but it could just be baked into the way the game parses conflict resolution, too. This is not a foreign concept to reality, after all: we all are part of a great many vehicles of resolution that utilize both less and more important participants, working together, to succeed. Most of us are, most of the time, not the most important member of the team.                        </div>

                            I actually have a lot of thoughts about dichotomies of weaker-stronger characters because there was an arc in my group's ongoing Chuubo's campaign that we just finished recently that did a lot with the weaker character-stronger character dichotomy. <br/>The stronger PC was effectively an unbeatable shounen protagonist. The weaker PC (my character) was basically just a physically disabled teenage girl who knows a bit of magic but was generally only really competent at like emotional support stuff. <br/><br/>The stronger PC was up against a threat she couldn't just punch though, so her shounen hero powers weren't doing a lot of help against it. She was faced with the threat of being corrupted by an evil goddess who wanted to turn her into basically a world-eating monster. The evil goddess was consistently corrupting her heart through their metaphysical bond. When the evil goddess showed up in the flesh, the shounen hero could kick her ass if they got in a direct fight, but the evil goddess was good at getting under her skin and corrupting her through indirect methods, and when the shounen hero had corruption in her heart, the evil goddess was stronger when fighting her, because of the fact that the corruption made the shounen hero have trouble resisting the evil goddess's commands. <br/><br/>This is where my character's stuff comes in! The tiny bit of magic that my character knew at the time essentially allowed her to purify people's hurts of corruption, but it was extremely difficult and physically strenuous on her to do it (especially with the fact that a big part of my character's storyline during that arc was her struggling to deal with her new physical disability after a string of injuries, a lot of which is based in chronic pain). <br/><br/>So then my character was getting to be exciting and cool in the conflict with the evil goddess despite the fact that if she got in a physical fight, she would easily get her ass kicked. <br/>Whenever the evil goddess and her minions were physically attacking the PCs and their friends, the shounen hero was fighting them off with her overwhelming physical force, and protecting her friends through kicking the ass of anyone and anything who tried to hurt them. But she was able to do it because of my character purifying her heart. If my character hadn't been there, the shounen hero would have fallen to corruption and wouldn't have been capable of using her overwhelming physical power to fight the evil goddess, because she would have been completely under her control.<br/><br/>In short, a huge part of making the dichotomy between a weaker character and a stronger character work is for there to be aspects of the situation that the stronger character is trying to deal with that they couldn't do if it wasn't for some (probably niche) ability that the weaker character has. <br/>Basically, the weaker character does their cool stuff so that the stronger character is able to do their cool stuff, and then everyone benefits and has fun, because alone neither of them could handle the situation, but together they can do it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            ...So, yeah, abstract "director power" points - as in Fate - and unlocked "manipulate outcome" bennies - as in <i>The Pool</i> - <b>might</b> cover all of the above, is we were fixated on creating a "do it all" rules system that nonetheless included the quite old-fashioned idea of allocating points to create a PC.<br/>Or, like some posters to this thread, we might be way past that already, focused on the sort of dramatic dynamic we want to achieve. As a previous, intermediate step (eventually a necessary one?) we might have divorced "mechanical effectiveness" (toward whatever object the game is) from fictional strength/power and "kewl fighting powers" (OK, I know I'm oversimplifying here).                        </div>

                            I only skimmed the above posts quickly but I only saw a quick reference to FATE while its entire mechanics are supposed to be built around gaining and spending fate points. While it’s encouraged to all make characters with strengths and flaws, it is technically possible to make a strong character with next to no flaws (and thus next to no FP generation) and one with almost nothing but flaws (and thus drowning in FP). <br/><br/>The rules also seem to encourage spending and generating the FP rather than to hoard it, though players often have to flip a switch in their mind to get that if they come from a more traditional gaming background it seems. And the outcomes can be rules-breaking once a session stunts, or FP powered special abilities, but usually people just seem to choose to specialize and have a flat +2 to a specific use of a specific skill. Which I find a sad thing.<br/><br/>Also, once players get how to create advantages a player can start to invoke a big stash of FP all at once for ludicrous bonusses to a roll. Or they can set things up with free uses of aspects when succeeding “with style” on a create advantage roll, so that the FP deprived character can use it for a free bonus.<br/><br/>Is this what you were looking for?                        </div>

                            Thanks, folks.<br/><br/>Checked  out the Buffy RPG.  White Hats and Heroes get more Drama Points than Slayers, but it's pretty bog-standard: <br/>-get a bonus to this hit<br/>-get a smaller bonus to the whole combat<br/>-shrug off damage<br/>-come back from the dead (!!!)<br/>-minor plot change, a step above the standard; “The evil vampires don’t kill me but keep me hostage!”<br/><br/>(I'm really surprised that the recent LotR and Doctor Who games don't do a great job with this.  I was disappointed.)<br/><br/>Bearded Belgian, the FATE rules are pretty much right in line with all this:<br/>-+1 to a roll<br/>-minor plot change<br/>-cancel a Fate point<br/><br/>    Blah, blah boring.  ...But wait!  <br/><br/>The rules get all apologetic about plot stuff (“Granting the players any degree of narrative control may seem like an odd idea to GMs who have not encountered the idea before”) but go on to say “It's possible to give player broad narrative power with this mechanic, allowing them to use Fate points to create plots and NPCs and generally complicate stories.”  <br/> <br/>This is the bullseye!  Is anyone aware of any FATE games or mods or whatnot that flesh this out, providing guidelines for the bigger-ticket items?<br/> </div>

Keep in mind that a <i>Fate</i> character can have a Trouble aspect that doesn’t represent a physical weakness. Like, superhero character hunted by the secret government lab that crated him, or a space pirate who owes a big debt to a crime boss. These are compellable sources of game complications, but we don’t read them as weakness or lack of capability.                         </div>

                            There was this AW/PbtA hack idea somewhere. It had only two 'playbooks' so to speak. One of them, the 'Fighter' had to follow the basic moves.

Is anyone aware of any FATE games or mods or whatnot that flesh this out, providing guidelines for the bigger-ticket items?<br/></p></div></blockquote>
One player took to penning down his observations and musings of the game, and these have been collected in <a href="denied:“https://www.evilhat.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-Book-of-Hanz-Fate-Core-Thought-of-the-Day.pdf”" rel="nofollow">The Book of Hanz</a>. With it’s 106 pages it’s a big read, but it’s so in depth that it’s featured on Evil Hat’s page itself. And even more, it’s just a collection of G+ posts, so they are like a collection of mostly small articles/blogpost type writings. (so you can skip those you don’t need) I think I read it all in about four days while only reading it while commuting. But it’s been a while.

Keep in mind that a <i>Fate</i> character can have a Trouble aspect that doesn’t represent a physical weakness. Like, superhero character hunted by the secret government lab that crated him, or a space pirate who owes a big debt to a crime boss. These are compellable sources of game complications, but we don’t read them as weakness or lack of capability. </div></blockquote>

                            I need to dig into Fate!  This ability to create game developments/ complications is what I'm thinking about.  <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Batman &amp; Robin are my thread exemplars, but my vision is more LotR: many characters, sandboxing around, at a spread of playable efficacies.  Paul's idea of having hard-wired interpersonal dynamics (Batman gets a +3 for taking Robin's advice) is good, and probably better than where I'm at, but feels like I'd need either a more focused game - "Hero and sidekick fight crime," for example - or else something like playbooks.<br/><br/>DeReel pointed me toward Anima Prime, which seems to offer a ton of powers, each with a set cost.  If these were chosen at character creation, it'd essentially be possible to build your own playbook of moves.  If they're available on the fly, then it's a pile of pre-formulated options.  <br/><br/>I'm in a less-granular-more-freeform space.  I guess I like the feel of a clear distinction, a balance between [the mechanics] and this other thing which is [whatever your mind can dream up].  A few guideposts to help establish costs, but other than that we're wide open. <br/><br/>And maybe liking this tension is what keeps me out of pure hardcore story gameness.  I like peanut butter, and I like chocolate, so I have this sense that the combination of flavors might be fun.  <br/><br/>Thanks for the input so far.                        </div>

                            I can very well imagine a LotR game where the hobbits are totally balanced against Gandalf and Aragorn because of their game-breaking, exclusive ability to carry the One Ring and resist its corruption.<br/>But if you handwave away the One Ring in your game about the Fellowship fighting their way through Moria, then... then it's some iteration of D&amp;D where the hobbits are level-0 and everybody else is quite high-level.<br/>So, it basically depend what your game is <i>about</i>.                        </div>

There’s an <a href="denied:“https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-oTJHKXHicQ1mCYbJXMTdXKHnDM_FL8G”" rel="nofollow">actual play series</a> where you can see most of the people practically jumping over each other to compell their fellow players once they get how this works. It’s also very funny. Halfway the campaign the GM was like “Why do I even prep anything? This thing runs itself and I can hardly keep up!”                        </div>

                            Oh, it just dawned on me that my game does that : Batman uses more fixed, reusable traits when Robin uses more all purpose tokens but he won't get them back as easily as Batman's refreshes.<br/>That's the idea but I need to polish the editing a bit more.                        </div>

                            This game Fate has got it going on!  I've been reading Fate Core and it's nice.  I thought I understood Fate, but I've had a lesser thing called Fate, Fudge Edition.  I don't know the ins and outs of this evolution, but I've been spending my time splashing in the baby pool and thinking that was all there was.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>1of3, I like rolling for competence!  <br/><br/>DeReel and Rafu both suggested that maybe there's no need to hold onto the simulationist cruft of MyGuy and his Cool Stats if we're working on making something that feels like a story game. <br/><br/>Fair point!<br/><br/>I'm shooting for a hybrid.  My approach is to take all those games with Fate Points or Drama Points or Bennies or Possibility Points or whatever and, rather than tightly control their use, turn them up to 11.  Start with a traditional frame and bring in the collaborative trust of modern story games.  Let players get GMish, <i>if they want</i>.<br/><br/>I've been looking for games that do this thing, and it seems like maybe I'm onto something new.  At least, I can't find anything that works in the way I'm envisioning.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's because it's a dumb idea; we'll see.<br/><br/>Thanks for the assistance.<br/>-Matt<br/><br/>(DeReel: keep us posted on this new thing you're working on; I'm plenty intrigued.)                        </div>
