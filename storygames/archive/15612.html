I entered the game Forsooth, and the rest is history. Now I am turning to the forum for playtesting--a task I know you are more than up to. <br/><br/>About the game:\n<blockquote>Act I<br/>On Making Characters and Preparing to Play<br/> <br/>Forsooth! is a game inspired by Shakespeare, wherein players control multiple characters with disparate motivations to, together, improvise a tale of Shakespearean scope. Unlike traditional RPGs, Forsooth! uses no \u201cgame master\u201d or \u201cstoryteller.\u201d One man in his time plays many parts, so we are all storytellers, all actors, all directors, all playwrights. As an ensemble, the players will work together to spin a tale. Whether that story is comedy or tragedy, history or farce, is up to the players to decide as the game runs its course. Along the way, the players\u2019 characters may scheme, fight, deliver moving soliloquies, question their mortal nature and even forswear their solemn oaths, all in the name of applause. The action begins when the first character enters, and ends when all the main characters are either married or dead.</blockquote>\nBy its nature, Forsooth is ideal for one-off play, but it also has (new) rules for campaigns and quick-play (about 1 hour) versions. If you are interested in being a playtester, PM me your email address and I will send you the game in its current incarnation. In exchange, you get to play a cool game for free, and get the names of your playgroup printed in the book!<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354231/#Comment_354231" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T08:43:46+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  8:43AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to everyone that's agreed to help me out!
