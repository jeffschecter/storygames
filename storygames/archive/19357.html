Nick from <i>Vagabonds</i> here. I know a few of you. For those of you I don't know, nice to meet you. I thought I'd finally post about this project on here, so here goes. The point of this thread is to give a basic introduction to what we are working on, and allow anyone to ask questions about it. We've intentionally held off on a lot of promotion. But now that we're finally finishing up alpha test revisions/re-writes and prepping the rules for an open beta test, it seems like a good time to open the floodgates, as it were.<br/><br/>Our website / development blog is located here: <a href="http://vagabondsrpg.com" rel="nofollow">vagabondsrpg.com</a>. You can find a good deal of information there, which you are welcome to ask about here.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;">* * * * *</div><br/><br/><b>What is <i>Vagabonds</i>?</b><br/>Set in a supernatural version of Japan\u2019s Edo period, <i>Vagabonds</i> is a tabletop roleplaying game that seeks to simulate the wide-ranging adventures and misadventures of wanderers and ragtag outcasts. Every player assumes the role of a vagabond. The personalities of vagabonds run the gamut! Vagrant monks, blind musicians, disgraced r\u014dnin, runaway pleasure women, wandering poets, starving artists, eccentric hermits, disowned warrior princesses, possessed priestesses, and on and on we could go.<br/><br/>Vagabonds are down-and-out. Dirty. Lonely. Misguided. Humorous. Indolent. Players can create a medicine-peddling kabuki actor with a penchant for divination, a blind musician whose songs put demons to sleep, a warrior priestess who was once a courtesan at the pleasure district of Yoshiwara, or even a r\u014dnin-turned-sumo wrestler who was recently imprisoned for extortion. These are just examples, but they are entirely possible within the <i>Vagabonds</i> roleplaying system.<br/><br/>So, as you can tell, eccentric character tropes are the focus here. Character creation reflects this. We want to capture your vagabond's complicated personality and mysterious past. Characters are removed from the status quo, simultaneously running from the shogunate as well as their own hangups. We also want to challenge your ideas of Japanese culture and tradition -- for example, is the Japanese experience limited to honor, duty, and subtlety? Heck no!<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://vagabondsrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cover-art-resized-small.jpg"/><br/><i>The cover art for the Vagabonds core rulebook.</i></div><br/><br/><b>Setting &amp; Plot Stuff</b><br/>The Edo period is considered early modern Japan -- ~1603 to 1867. That being said, we use history as a guideline rather than a restraint. We also don't assume you are a graduate student in Japanese history. In the core rulebook, we provide various setting details and era-specific scenarios, but we don't overdo it. We provide you with the ingredients to create your own unique game world that doesn't have to stick so close to the history books (though, if you want to stick to history, by all means). Ultimately, history is more a backdrop than a focus -- again, those vagabond-y characters are the stars of the narrative. Still, we want to emphasize that the game does take place in a specific era of <i>Japanese</i> history, and is not an Asian mishmash. We thus give plenty of info on Japanese culture, ranging from era-specific political structures to art and architecture. But no, you won't have to read through 100 pages of setting fluff before jumping into the game.<br/><br/>As far as plot goes, it obviously varies depending on what kind of game, exactly, your table wants to play. But in general, think of X-Files set during the Tokugawa Shogunate. Strange stuff is happening throughout the realm, and the oppressive bureaucracy of the shogunate is undoubtedly feeling threatened (or, perhaps, even involved). Some elements of the shogunate could be attempting to cover up the supernatural, while others could be actively seeking it out in hopes of obtaining power. For example, secret shogunal organizations could be following your scruffy group of vagabonds, keeping a watchful eye and interfering whenever possible. But, your narrative doesn't have to always involve vagabonds vs. "the man" -- we give a bunch of seeds for cults, corrupt religious organizations, martial arts schools, countryside bandits, yakuza gangs, pirates, local lords, powerful merchants, artist colonies, and even science/invention guilds.<br/><br/>The "strange stuff" is inspired by Japanese folklore and weird fiction. So yeah, <i>Vagabonds</i> features your classic y\u014dkai, bakemono, mononoke, etc. But, the game is not usually focused on hack-and-slash combat. We don't typically have armies of oni pouring out of mountain caves or other Westernized interpretations of Japanese lore. Instead, the game tends to value mysterious, investigative narratives in which tension gradually builds until it boils over. In addition to giving a lot of info about creatures, we also place a huge emphasis on hauntings and cults. Of course, confrontations are not only supernatural. Yakuza street brawls, tense duels with shogunal police, and other such confrontations are likewise represented. We even have "social confrontation" rules, which can cover awkward tea ceremonies with nobility or threats to a character's prestige (for example).<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://vagabondsrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/icons-labels-new-smaller.jpg"/><br/><i>A section of our game map featuring the T\u014dkaid\u014d, one of the major thoroughfares linking Edo and Kyoto. [WIP]</i></div><br/><br/><b>Inspiration</b><br/>Practically any outcast character you've seen in Japan-themed media / pop culture has been an inspiration. This ranges from classics like Seven Samurai, Lone Wolf &amp; Cub, and Baian the Assassin to manga/anime like Samurai Champloo, Mushi-shi, and House of Five Leaves. Books and movies based on the supernatural in Japan have also, of course, been hugely inspirational. Anything written by Lafcadio Hearn, for example, and books/movies such as Ugetsu Monogatari and Kaidan. Both classic and contemporary Japanese authors have likewise had a huge influence. In fact, our primary inspiration -- and what initially started this project -- are folkloric texts and popular novels written during the Edo period, as well as ukiyo-e, sumi ink drawings, and other era-specific art forms that evolved amidst a growing middle class. The core rulebook's design and layout will be based on this aesthetic.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://vagabondsrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/cloud-of-monstrosity-smaller.jpg"/><br/><i>A lot of our art is hand-drawn with sumi ink. [WIP]</i></div><br/><br/><b>Mechanics</b><br/><i>Vagabonds</i> uses its own system. Instead of going on a spiel about the system here, see <a href="http://vagabondsrpg.com/mechanics-in-a-nutshell/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> on our website. Generally speaking, the system might be disappointing to OSR folks -- I think there are maybe three tables in the entire rulebook. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> [I jest here.]<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;">* * * * *</div><br/><br/>Well, that's it for now. Our schedule is: finish beta, playtest, revise, send to editor, then Kickstart to fund final artwork, layout, and (hopefully) a print run. At that point, the plaintext rules will be available for all to see (before making a decision to back) -- and to continue playtesting up until publishing/printing. Questions, comments, discussion, whatever else are always encouraged.

I suspect you and I could have some pretty intense conversations. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>By the way, I've been reminded that a while back we did play a few sessions of <i>Vagabonds</i> with a rotating GM scheme. In this case, GM duties would shift to a player when the story veered into situations related to the character's vagrancies. So, if Kihei had a history as a back-alley fortuneteller, GM duties would be passed to his player when the group was wandering through eta slums or dealing with divination cults. There was a little more to it, but that was the gist. It was pretty fun with that particular group, but I'm not sure if I would make it a standard rule or just an aside sub-section in the rulebook (like, "Hey, you can also do this, and here's how you do it").<br/><br/>On the other hand, I'm not a fan of inserting a dozen optional rules in a rulebook, so I might just have to ask for some playtest input when the beta is ready. I know it can be tricky for some to share ownership / setting details of a game world, or play without a central arbitrator. In our case, we haven't played like that in a while, but that's partially because I'm never the type of GM who exerts strict control over his game world anyway. I often feel my GMing is most successful when it soaks up insightful input. The core game already encourages players to exert a good deal of narrative control.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
