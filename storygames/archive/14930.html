For example, having to pick any of the economical details won't really change the setup of the story. Same thing with most of the luxury or exotic categories: whether we are driving around in the Audi or BMW or Infiniti, the general make and model of each of these probably doesn't make much difference. (I had to look up what a Zonda is, to me, that isn't much different than a Lamborghini).<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said that, I like the Peculiar category. As each of those elements can lead to strange, different tangents. Maybe combining some elements of those categories. Otherwise, I think I'd prefer my players to come up with their own ride given the circumstances (but that's just me)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping the Peculiar class, I would suggest some other categories like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nQuirks:<br/>\n1. Only drives in reverse<br/>\n2. Engine always shuts down at the wrong time<br/>\n3. Radio picks up strange broadcasts<br/>\n4. Door, hood, and trunk have a tendency to pop open by themselves<br/>\n5. Gaping holes in the floor boards<br/>\n6. Unusual smells, smoke, or sounds<br/>\n<br/>\nUnique selling point:<br/>\n1. Insane 2000-watt car audio system<br/>\n2. Seats easily convert to vibrating bed<br/>\n3. Top of vehicle has "Instant Outdoor Rave" laser light show package installed<br/>\n4. "It's got a cop motor, a 440 cubic inch plant, it's got cop tires, cop suspensions, cop shocks. It's a model made before catalytic converters so it'll run good on regular gas."<br/>\n5. Push button Nitrous Injector (with two uses left)<br/>\n6. Converted to a stretch limo<br/>\n<br/>\nPrevious (or legally current) Owner:<br/>\n1. Drug smuggler<br/>\n2. Angry relative<br/>\n3. A series of mysterious deaths<br/>\n4. Forgotten in a barn for many years, but otherwise, like new<br/>\n5. Forgotten celebrity way past his/her prime<br/>\n6. Stolen<br/>\n<br/>\nDaily Use<br/>\n1. RV<br/>\n2. Family Van<br/>\n3. Contractor's truck or van<br/>\n4. SUV with the "off-road" package<br/>\n5. Long-distance tow truck<br/>\n6.
