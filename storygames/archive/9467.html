I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t!<br/>\n<br/>\nCamp Nerdly in 4 words: <b>Quality time with quality people.</b><br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal was to play new games with new people and distant friends. I won!<br/>\n<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Blank_White_Cards" rel="nofollow">1000 Blank White Cards</a><br/>\n<br/>\nA party game where you draw your own cards. Think Magic the Gathering except you invent your deck as you play. I\u2019ve avoided playing before because it seemed like more work than fun. It wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s a great ice breaker and a game to consider playing at cons that is inclusive to stimulate socializing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://spione.adept-press.com/" rel="nofollow">Spione: Story Now in Cold War Berlin</a><br/>\n<br/>\nDave ran. That sold me alone. Simple game with lots of possibilities, strong color, easily supports a large group of players, quick resolution, almost zero prep, lots of fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou tell the story of 2 spies in Berlin. My only disappointment was that the second immoral transgression was never revealed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a little difficult to track the simultaneous stories of 2 spies with mostly separate casts. We subconsciously started merging the cast to simplify things. But otherwise the game was smooth, dramatic, and had a satisfying ending. I loved flashpoints and how a spy has to remove a supporting character after each flashpoint once the immoral transgression is incorporated into the story. The use of card value and suit to determine the supporting character\u2019s fate was clever.<br/>\n<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/fairplay/category/fiasco/" rel="nofollow">Fiasco</a><br/>\n<br/>\nLoved character and situation creation. Using Jason\u2019s rules I could play 20 games of Fiasco with 10 minutes of prep and each game would be completely different. Sold! I believe Jason felt that the game was a little flat. I enjoyed it. But I agree that it never shifted out of second gear except for the very end which was horrifying. It still repulses me! Just sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy didn\u2019t it escalate? I think the suburban setting and the very realistic characters and situations kept it from attaining the level of drama of a movie. It was a very real game. Which is partly why the end was so sad. But I suspect, although satisfying, it wasn\u2019t what Jason intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m usually the person to smash things to the next level of insanity but I felt invested in the character\u2019s normalcy and enjoyed the challenge of not taking things to the next level. But it could have used just 1 more level. I\u2019m also uber conscious of stealing spotlight (especially in games where I\u2019m playing a supporting character like this one) which sometimes makes me more reserved than normal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other factor seems to be the twist. Half way through the game we introduce 2 elements that twist the game\u2019s situation. I felt these elements weren\u2019t fully taken advantage of or weren\u2019t twists at all as they simply built on the path things were already headed in. I think this is where things could have but didn\u2019t progress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue might be that it was structured freeform minus the basic guidelines of even a system like improv. The same issue came up in Montsegur 1244. There wasn\u2019t a system in place for Yes And\u2026 Building\u2026 No Blocking\u2026 nor was there a system to communicate intents. I could tell there were instances where someone wanted to go in a direction and their dancing partner didn\u2019t quite follow their subtle lead in both games. Although Fiasco did have a way to communicate if the scene should end positively or negatively which helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: the fact that this was a con game with people who don\u2019t play weekly together should also be taken into account. I suspect that with more familiar players, you need less structure to freeform and clear intents. These were also shorter games.<br/>\n<br/>\n(continued below)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209863/#Comment_209863" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-01T12:17:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2009 12:17PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            - <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis game completely caught me off guard. It wasn\u2019t what I expected. But it was very good. It\u2019s like the mountain witch in that it is a built in scenario with rules except in this case the characters are provided and play can start almost instantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt reminded me of the old Burning Wheel 10 player LARPish games. Luke had similar relationship maps and instead of using questions to aim at the other characters Luke would use Burning Wheel beliefs and instincts.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also reminded me of Grey Ranks and the Roach in that it provided a scene structure and arc as well as elements to incorporate into each scene that really made the setting and fiction come alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt suffered a bit from some of the issues I described above in Fiasco but the character questions and story cards really helped focus and drive play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played Cecille, a dying woman who is one of the town\u2019s spiritual leaders. I planned on playing her as a warm and hopeful influence to contrast the invading forces. But after the first scene, another character said something which shocked me (talking about flirting with the outside invaders) that I in mid sentence I changed who Cecille was and made her a tyrannical and fanatical soul divorced from reality and concerns of the flesh. I ripped out one of my back teeth that was slowly rotting and gave it to the girl who wanted to flirt with the outsider as a sign that the flesh is temporary at best and focus should be paid to what is really important.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene Jeff and Jason played together where Jeff tried to make a deal with his old friend who broke his leg to call off the invasion in exchange for one of his daughters was pure brilliance. Great performance! Stunning.<br/>\n<br/>\nDanielle also stole the show. No question.<br/>\n<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ryanmacklin.com/?page_id=62" rel="nofollow">MythEnder</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRyan had to stop me from giving him money. And money is tight and he hasn\u2019t even written the game yet!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Mythender you play the equivalent of a 30th level D&amp;D; character killing myths and gods before you are ended or fall to a fate worse than death\u2026 become a god yourself to be hunted by your fellow Mythenders.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine stabbing Odin in his good eye and telling him how much of a little punk he his.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played a pirate who was drowned by her own crew after she was sacrificed to the god of the ocean in hope they would reach shore.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome games have beliefs or goals. In Mythender you have impossible drives. Yup, impossible. I swore to rid the earth of all oceans. Yup.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy weapons? I can literally take the water from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve enslaved my former crew who now drag my ship around by land since I refuse to sail again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as I grow in myth I become less mortal. My tell tale was that there is an anchor embedded inside me connected to a chain dragging across the land infinitely back to the exact location where I drowned in the middle of the ocean.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite part was when I wanted to become more mortal. I told a farmer who just lost his family that he was my father now and to tell me the bedtime stories he used to tell his children\u2026 the ones that just drowned due to the serpent. Wow. WTF!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the GM says no to you\u2026 about anything\u2026 they write it down and give it a number. You can then attack it till the no becomes a yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan\u2026 write the game. Now\u2026 do it now!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also had plenty of amazing conversations about taking D&amp;D; 4E to the next level, marketing, graphic design, semiotics, convention marketing, and much more!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only regrets is that I couldn\u2019t spend more time with people.

Camp Nerdly rocked. Seriously. <br><br><b>Scheduling</b><br><br>The only thing I wonder about is the event scheduling. Both of my events were full of awesome players and I always found something fantastic to play when I wanted, so I'm not complaining at all. Scheduling just seemed really disorganized. <br><br>First there was online scheduling -- well, it was more interest registering. Some people I talked to said they checked the site once or twice early on and didn't go back to see what had been added. Because we kept the game list ordered alphabetically rather than by date added, people weren't sure what was new (unless they knew how to use the History tab, as I did). <br><br>Then there was onsite sign-ups. The easel sign-up worked wonderfully, I think. At first, I was concerned that we were putting the sheets out for only one slot at a time. This, I think, turned out to be a feature, and not a bug, since people were less likely to sign up for events and not show up for them. I heard numerous suggestions for ways to make this sign-up process slightly better, but the process worked.<br><br>My one major regret was that Frank asked me to reserve a spot for him in my D&amp;D Metrocalypse game. Then he went off like a good soldier to clean the kitchen after lunch and lost his spot. I offered to shoehorn him back in when he got done but he declined, probably because the table was full. Frank, I apologize. <br><br><b>Gaming</b><br><br>The two games I ran went very well, thanks to the fine people who played in them. I was incredibly unprepared for these games, it turns out, and I hope it didn't show too badly. I apologize to my patient players.<br><br>The games I played in were amazing. I tried some things I would normally pass up and enjoyed them greatly. I know now that I need to purchase Ticket to Ride. I also would love to play more of Eric's hacked Mechaton-cum-Gundam game, and I might hack it further to be a fantasy miniatures skirmish game. Despite problems mentioned elsewhere and bad kidney pain and frequent bathroom trips, I had fun playing How We Came to Live Here. Luckily, I was feeling better by the afternoon. I only wish I'd realized there was a bathroom in the Castle. The Jeepform Sampler was a lot of fun. I felt we struggled with some of the exercises, but the final improv "Forged Butter" play was pure comedy gold.<br><br><b>Everything else</b><br><br>The food was good. Thanks to everyone who shopped or cooked. Cooking for 50 is way different than cooking for 4, I know. You guys were amazing.<br><br>The chore system worked, mostly. Thank you to everyone who completed chores. Bigger thank-yous to everyone who helped out with a chore they weren't assigned.<br><br>I kinda got left for dead on cleanup after Friday snacks, since my Grime Assassin compatriots hadn't yet arrived. It wasn't a huge deal -- there wasn't a lot to clean up -- but it would have been three times quicker with help. Since it's hardly a secret who was assigned to Friday cleanup, I'm gonna call some folks out. Andrew Morris and Sean Leventhal: where were you guys? I know Andrew arrived late. If you knew you were going to arrive late, you should have swapped chores with someone. Especially after making some public comments about hating chores and offering to pay to get out them. It looks bad.<br><br>With few exceptions, I felt everyone stepped up and made the experience great.  <br><br>The main thing I'd change is to leave a little more time after the big meals for people to clean up, or assign more cleaners to those chores. People shouldn't have to miss games because they are washing pots.<br><br>Whoever brought the bicycle--thank you! It dawned on me that I hadn't actually ridden a bike in about 15 years, so I took the opportunity to fix that at Nerdly. A couple times I needed to zip back to my cabin or down to the parking lot, and the bike made the trip fast. Of course, I now have soreness in muscles I had forgotten existed. Fun!<br><br>I am looking forward to next year!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210138/#Comment_210138" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T08:07:14+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  8:07AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm excited for D&amp;D; Metrocalypse.

If it is something that we could effectively test in 3 encounters... even better!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo riff off of Adam's thoughts, I thought camp nerdly ran fairly smoothly. The only 2 things I would suggest:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. No wiki game signups. Everything happens on site and you can only sign up for one time slot at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I'm not sure about the logistics, but it felt we needed at least 10-20 more minutes between sessions to complete chores.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I just remembered another part I loved. In the middle of Saturday, there were 2 time slot options. You could play two 2.5 hour games or one 5 hour game.I thought this was a great idea.

That's something that we can definitely refine, probably by accounting for prep and clean-up outside of the game slots.  So Lunch and dinner are two hour things, with a half hour of scheduled work on either end.  If you are free, you could use that time to do something else I suppose -like a dedicated board game time.  Just a thought.<br><br>I was Kitchen Boss Friday night and I let my Masters know who wasn't there to clean up.

And was grateful for the willingness and energy that people brought to the Freeform Sampler workshop. The late night conversations on Saturday, and lingering leaving on Sunday were also wonderful.  <br><br>One hard part for me was working on dinner, Saturday night. The crew was wonderful, but we just didn't have enough time to do everything, so dinner was late. I'd very much suggest having at least an hour prep time scheduled for dinner. I don't know if other meals need that.  I was also wishing I had a few more containers in the kitchen for prep and presentation. Thank so much to whoever provided our kitchen tools and all the food! <br><br>Also food oriented, I noticed for Saturday morning's breakfast, someone had posted notes about the food and what to prepare. I foolishly assumed we'd get that for all the meals. I wish I'd done it independently when I realized that was not so.  <br><br>All in all, a fantastic con.

If we want to run a prep heavy game or a game that involves carrying a lot of parts, it is helpful to measure the level of interest in playing beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\nMetrocalypse creatures to test would very easy. Especially if they range from level 5-8. Linked encounters are also great. In terms of characters, I'd say give us both pregens and guidelines.

How does that sound? That would make Saturday's schedule something like:\n<blockquote>8:00 - Breakfast<br>9:30 - Gaming A (3 hrs)<br>12:30 - Lunch<br>2:00 - Gaming B (3 hrs)<br>5:00 - Dinner<br>7:00 - Gaming C (3 hrs)<br>10:00 - Gaming D (2-3 hrs)</br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\n<b>Scheduling</b><br>Using the Wiki to gauge interest was helpful, but I'm not sure about the actual scheduling.

I wanted to make sure breakfast went off without too many problems, which is why I wrote this up the night before.  I left it because Sunday had the same menu, but we should have done them for the other meals as well.<br><br>A larger problem with meal preparation is the lack of decent equipment.

This produces more work in planning games and has the potential to put a person into more chores if not done just so, but there might be a way to make it work. Maybe for each slot that's normally 4 hours, there is one 3 hour game, and the meal captain for that meal or the cleanup captain is responsible for running a game in that reduced time slot and finding people to volunteer for their game/chore combo slot.  Like I might run "Saturday Dinner Cleanup followed by In a Wicked Age" or "Car Wars followed by Lunch Prep". Then nobody in that combo slot has to worry about missing out on their gaming, and the crew bonds not just through the game but through shared chores.

Hmm, I'm not sure if that would help or not. More people require more equipment, and as it was, we were passing around stuff when I cleaned the kitchen. Some things also have to wait until other things are done (namely sweeping and mopping) and some things just take time (namely dishes, since there was only one sink we commandeer for that purpose).<br><br>I didn't do any cooking, so I don't know what the issues are on that front, but it would probably help if there was some way to do food prep ahead of time (like they do in restaurants). I'm not sure who or how that would fit in, but it's something to think about. It would certainly speed up cooking if all the cooks had to do is pull something out of the frig and plop it onto a hot pan or whatever.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210223/#Comment_210223" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-03T13:19:33+00:00" title="June  3, 2009  1:19PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>It would certainly speed up cooking if all the cooks had to do is pull something out of the frig and plop it onto a hot pan or whatever.</blockquote>\nI'm pretty sure this is the way it was done for the pasta and jars of Ragu. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> Salads and veggies take more prep, obviously.

The question is:  Are the potential benefits of disposable eating &amp; cooking gear (15-20 minutes per cleaner, maybe) worth the extra trash we will produce?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210369/#Comment_210369" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T12:53:49+00:00" title="June  4, 2009 12:53PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I know that we use a variant on <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/234448110/disposable_tableware_cornstarch_based_environment_friendly_.html" rel="nofollow">this stuff</a> for our picnics.</p>\n<p>And before anyone mentions another word about environmental stuff, just look at how much gas got burned getting bums in cabins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210378/#Comment_210378" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T13:40:12+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  1:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The "front of the line" thing sounds good in theory but it seems like it would be awkward to implement in practice.

As far as more time on meals I have this suspicion that games will expand to fill any empty time.  A lot of the games I played in were cramped for time.  No prepared meals is not a bad idea either.<br><br>I don't want all this talk about chores to distract the organizers from the fact that Camp Nerdly was a ton of fun again.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was my third Nerdly -- well, <i>our</i> third Nerdly, since Sandy's come to all of them too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games were excellent, as always.  Kudos to everyone on that!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as sign-ups go, I liked the online scheduling grid of CN1 and 2, and missed it a lot.  It was easy to tell quickly which games were going to conflict with each, and figure out what I wanted to play in each slot.  This time around, there were a lot of "unscheduled" games.  I'm always a bit leery of signing up for those, since (a) I don't know what they're going to conflict with, and (b) my overly-wanting-things-organized self wonders whether the games are actually going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also ran into the other end of the scheduling problem -- I put my own game (... and cast no shadow) up, then waited for people to express interest before scheduling it.  Once three people had expressed interest, I tried to be clever and schedule my game in a slot where it wasn't up against any of the other people's "I must play this" games, and as few as possible "I want to play this if schedule permits" ones.  I only had one of the latter when I scheduled it, out of the three people expressing interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, of course, when it actually came time to do it, all three of those people had signed up for other games in the same time slot.  I was actually up there to write "cancelled due to lack of players" on the board when I was saved by Danielle and... Scott?  (Apologies for not being sure about your name.)  It was looking dark for a while there, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor meal times, Sandy and I wound up half an hour late to the game after we were on meal cleanup -- Clinton's Swords Against Fate.

Also, there was the chore list at the sign in desk but no one really looked at it because there was no one sitting at the desk after a while and of course people were making their hellos and all that good stuff so it probably went to the back of their minds in priority.  Some people came and found me or I went up and checked them in so they knew what they were doing and where they were going to sleep.  (On a side note, if I go next year, I volunteer ahead of time to be the one signing in folks.  Gimme a big feather hat like the gals in Vegas wear this way I'll be easy to find if I have to step away from the table.  LOL!)<br><br>But originally I didn't know I was in the kitchen until it was pointed out to me and then I asked to be switched out.  I hate kitchen duty.  I can't stand it!  I'll do it if no one else steps up but it's -never- my first choice.  The year prior, I voluteered for my chore thus I knew I had a chore to do and when to do it. <br><br>It's been my experience that if you are assigned the task, you will forget it and if you chose the task you not forget it. <br/><br/>Just my two cents.<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210823/#Comment_210823" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-07T20:52:16+00:00" title="June  7, 2009  8:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: urbanpagan</cite>My bathroom people were fantastic!

That way, it costs time, but not participation. I'd decided beforehand that cars would come back next turn, but we only wound up playing one point, so that was moot. Maybe giving them some sort of off-arena, sloppy, explosive weapon with which to enhance the mess, or perhaps letting enthusastic fans, controlled by the player of the dead driver, onto the field to run over and grab the flag, LAW in hand (They're for sale at the concession stand!)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210941/#Comment_210941" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T12:28:40+00:00" title="June  8, 2009 12:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really glad Eppy crashed and died in your game playtest because then he wandered over to my game playtest!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210954/#Comment_210954" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T13:26:28+00:00" title="June  8, 2009  1:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2009 1:27PM by Eric Provost.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Next year's schedueling system will revolve around Eppy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What time would you like Eppy to start playing with you?
