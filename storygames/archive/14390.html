That's not a bad thing, but the tools available to a stunt/action coordinator for expressing a character are very different from those available to an actor or writer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327024/#Comment_327024" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T07:50:36+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  7:50AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Storytelling in Games: Part 1 - The Past and Present</cite>Book sales are in decline; cinema queues are thinning; the art of the tweet is on the rise. Video games, like many emerging forms of digital entertainment, are the latest indicator that the way we consume media is changing. We want different things from our entertainment these days. Humanity is starting to move away from passive forms of recreation \u2013 instead opting to 'lean-in', participate and shape their experience. </blockquote>\nConsole Video Game sales are also in decline. <br/><br/>While mobile games (which are less graphic rich, have less cut scenes, and don't strive to be interactive movies) are on the rise. <br/><br/>I don't think we are seeing people move away from passive entertainment in favor of interactive entertainment (although functional literacy rates are in decline). We're seeing an overabundance of entertainment options as people generally have less and less time. We're working more, have less recreation time but more recreation options. Almost everything is going to be in decline relative to when we had fewer options to entertain us\u2026 except for maybe American Idol (close to 40 million US viewers, 13% of US TV viewers) and the Super Bowl (100+ million US viewers, 33% of US TV viewers). <br/><br/>Additionally, people are consuming entertainment in ways people can't track or don't add sales. One of the reasons scifi shows do so poorly is because so many scifi fans don\u2019t want to consume entertainment the old way. So they do so in whatever way is most convenient for them, which often means the show does poorly financially. Let me stress, this isn't fans' faults. But technology and social norms are outpacing the existing business models. The same thing is happening with console video games. Their sales may be in decline, but more people are playing than ever, but they are playing used games whose sales aren't being accurately tracked. <br/><br/>Different people want different things, including different types of stories, with different levels of interactivity and control. If you try to please everyone, you please no one. Instead of looking for the best way to tell an interactive story, I think the answer is finding an audience who is big enough to support you financially and wants a specific experience\u2026 and give it to them rather than telling them what you think they should want. Assuming money is a goal (which I think it is for the people being interviewed). If money isn't a goal, then that's a different and more personal conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327069/#Comment_327069" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T11:51:05+00:00" title="May 31, 2011 11:51AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite true.

Bioware and 2K touch on doing something beyond that, but still fairly disappointing - the 'bang' in these games is "do I be good or evil?", you make the decision once as you start (or you're going to get reamed game-wise), and then you get to see one of two endings. But at least there are some choices and some interesting experiments. (When you're attacked by Big Daddys in Bioshock 2 is procedural - an attempt at a 'cinematic moment' generator.)<br/><br/>The thoughts are also very surface - this is one of those "interviews" where they just e-mail you a question, you e-mail back an answer, and that's that. <br/><br/>I think there'd be a lot more meat there if they'd interviewed guys like Will Wright, Jason Rohrer, Clint Hocking, "Toady One" and Chris Crawford. There are guys out there that think that you can get a whole new kind of story experience out of computer games and we just haven't figured out how yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327118/#Comment_327118" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-31T15:08:11+00:00" title="May 31, 2011  3:08PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2011 3:08PM by Simon_C.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never had anyone tell me a story about an awesome thing that happened when they were playing BioShock or whatever. But people are always telling me about the stuff that happens in their Minecraft games, and what's more, I like hearing those stories! It's a different kind of storytelling, for sure, but I think it's where video games are strongest.<br/><br/>Stories like "I was just tooling around in my castle, and then I look up and there's a fucking creeper just standing in my living room. I must have left the door open! I back away but of course it's too late, and it just owns all my shit. I get blown down into my basement, and now there's this hole in my front wall, and mobs are just pouring in, and I'm madly trying to save all my stuff that's strewn everywhere, patching up the wall, and then there's <i>another</i> freaking creeper in my face, all like "HI"."<br/><br/>Or like: "I'd just found this incredible vein of diamonds: Six of them, one after the other. And I'm mining the last one and I guess I got the diamond fever or something, because it's right under my feet, and the next thing you know, I'm falling into the darkness. And then I'm down in the black, three torches left, no idea which way to go to get home, and the sound of zombies all around me."<br/><br/>That's the kind of storytelling I want more of.

Do my decisions have consequences? Sure. Can I optimize those consequences perfectly by reading an extremely brief tutorial and/or grinding out certain content? Pretty much always.<br/><br/>That said, I didn't read said tutorial for the endgame and I think one guy died, who I kind of liked! So that was a step up from the usual experience, even if it was completely out of whack with my expectations for how such a game operates. I mean, we're talking about a game where nobody ever dies in combat, even if you let them get filled through with laser holes, or blasted to psionic bits -- and then at the end it turns out that cutscene bullets are 100% lethal? Uhm, okay. <br/><br/>Writer ego &gt; emergent mechanics producing emotional results is pretty much the Bioware trademark, and I'm with many others in this thread in that I feel like this is generally short-changing the medium. I mean we are literally talking about a game where the only thing that can kill an important character is the script. I'd feel a lot worse about a party member dying because I took them into a dangerous fight than I would because I didn't bother to complete their special loyalty mission because <i>I was busy saving the fucking galaxy,</i> which seemed for some reason like it might be kind of time sensitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327208/#Comment_327208" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T00:40:25+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 12:40AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2011 1:17AM by johnzo.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What I like about Alpha Protocol is there is never any indication that there is a "right" answer.</blockquote>\nFallout: New Vegas is giving me some of the same vibes -- I'm about 20 hours into it and it (SPOILERS) seems to be setting my character up as a kingmaker, a guy who is going to figure out which set of assholes is going to rule the Mohave.

It got panned for... what was it it got panned for again? <br/>EDIT: Mostly:<br/>* "it Totally has 'last gen' graphics" from the me-crowd. Well, I guess if someone wants to make a big-budget game, that's what they have to deal with...<br/>* buggy at times<br/>* Ah, and at times the boss fights were too long/dumb/hard.<br/><br/>Because it is probably the best example of non-linear storytelling in a big budget game in several years. I played through it four times, each time with completely different storyline and results, none of them "Bad" or "Good" like in some games ("Good Ending" vs "Perfect Ending" etc).<br/><br/>Plus, it's pretty much a stealth action game like Splinter Cell or Thief The Dark Project. It's already locked down on cool for that alone, it was the awesome story choices that put it over the top.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327260/#Comment_327260" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T08:12:16+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  8:12AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2011 8:20AM by J_Walton.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/116/1165886p1.html" rel="nofollow">part two</a>.<br/><br/><b>Part 2: Questions</b><br/><br/>-- What challenges are there in telling a story in a video game, where the viewer is an active participant?<br/>-- Are gameplay and storytelling at odds in modern video games?

You may not be able to count on, for instance, pacing, or the exact sequence of events. This can be daunting for someone who is used to the kind of one-way storytelling in other media, where precise use of those elements is an essential part of the craft. However, as anyone who has ever participated in a well-run session of Dungeons and Dragons can tell you, that's not the only way to tell a story. It changes from telling a story to the audience to telling a story with the audience - which can be a good and powerful thing.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327273/#Comment_327273" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T09:19:26+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  9:19AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lame:<br/><br/><br/>The Holy Grail is to subtly introduce gating techniques without delivering the 'on rails' feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327278/#Comment_327278" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T09:26:17+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  9:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My ultimate feeling is that you guys here on story games know more about the intersection of story and games than these guys, but what you know can't be done on a computer yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327279/#Comment_327279" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T09:28:20+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  9:28AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And you've totally sold me on Alpha Protocol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327280/#Comment_327280" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T09:33:31+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  9:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>I think there'd be a lot more meat there if they'd interviewed guys like Will Wright, Jason Rohrer, Clint Hocking, "Toady One" and Chris Crawford.</blockquote>\nYes!

Often, you won't even see the consequences of your decision for several hours of gameplay, until you reach some trigger point where the game gives you a little flashback montage and narrated voiceover to tell you the larger effects of what you did.<br/><br/>It's used very effectively.  One of the problems with significant either/or choices in computer games is that you end up making content that some players won't see: by specifically drawing the player's attention to an earlier decision point, you clue them in and let them know that this situation they are now entering into is due to that choice they made earlier on, as well as posing the question "What if you'd decided to do the other thing instead?" (sometimes explicitly).  When I played it, I found that I was really hesitating before making big decisions, trying to guess what the long-term consequences would be, and every time I found out what my choice meant later on, I felt like I was really affecting the story, not just running down the same set of rails with a different array of conversation options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327290/#Comment_327290" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T10:08:49+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 10:08AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does ultimate freedom mean acting out of character? Unless your character is unethical and chaotic?<br/><br/>They brought up issues where main characters are supposed to be honorable yet in sandbox games, they could wander around acting quite dishonorably. When they return to the main storyline, the story pretends none of their side quest dishonorable actions happened. And generally some players don't care, they are happy to break the fiction to cause trouble and push limits. <br/><br/>It's been mentioned that games where you play unethical characters actually lend themselves to more freedom since chaotic behavior is less likely to cause fictional friction. Which is one of the reasons Grand Theft Auto works well where LA Noire doesn't. In LA Noire, playing a law abiding character means less freedom. You can\u2019t for example use your gun unless it is in a situation where your character, not you, would deem it appropriate. Where in Grand Theft Auto there is little your character would consider not appropriate. <br/><br/>It seems the idea of character may be too limiting in video games. Do the majority of video game players want to play a role? Hell, a considerable number of RPG players don't want to play a role. Instead, shifting the focus to relationships and situations would allow more freedom of choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327293/#Comment_327293" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T10:19:05+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 10:19AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The flipside, there are a lot of people who want mostly linear experiences.

Heck, they were possible 10 years ago.  That's just not the priority of most game developers, given their abilities honed making other kinds of games and what they think the market wants (which is, apparently, yet another forgettable first-person shooter (FPS) with the same blank slate, loner/badass protagonist).  I mean, even stuff like Bioshock barely scratches the surface.  <i>It's still an FPS with a blank slate, loner/badass protagonist</i>, right?  Just a moody, colorful, and well-designed one.  Same with Portal, really.  It shows what you can do, if you're creative, within the structure of a traditional FPS, but it's only groundbreaking compared to its even more derivative peers. If you're making yet another FPS-type game, doing something as interesting as Portal should be <i>the default</i>. Otherwise, why bother?<br/><br/>Inevitably somebody will hit a home run with a game that truly realizes the potential here and then the entire industry will play catch-up (that's how its worked before), but it may still be a while before the inertia of the status quo is overcome or the tools for making games filter down to more people. Stuff like Minecraft and Sleep Is Death are just the tip of the iceberg, in terms of games produced by "a kid with a dream."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327381/#Comment_327381" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T16:01:40+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  4:01PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2011 4:02PM by TylerT.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

It's the first Rockstar game I've played where I didn't feel physically ill just a short ways into it -- I am definitely not in the GTA target demo. But RDR seems to hit this interesting mix of sandbox freedom + western themes pretty nicely.<br/><br/>For example, in the first three hours of play, I ran into a crazy old guy with a dowsing rod camped out in the hills. I go through the cinematic, and find out the dowser wants to put in a well -- but to do that he needs to get the deed to the land (i.e. add this quest to your list yes/no?). Sure, why not, I'm sort of bored at this point and it's early.<br/><br/>I go talk to the guy with the deed, who asks for more money than I've got -- what feels like a LOT of money to me at this point. Well, I've been playing for three hours and haven't had a lot of successes, and I'm faced with the option of coming back with lots of money, or walking away, or taking the deed from him by force. So I shoot him in the chest and take his deed. <br/><br/>Now this moment of play feels super interesting to me because it feels like a story-game-y "bang" type moment. Yes yes, my fame goes up and my honor goes down, these are purely mechanical results due to my murdering a guy, but later on I'm then faced with either keeping the deed for myself (and keeping the property, woot!), or handing it over to the guy with the dowsing rod. I hand it over, and it's a bloodied document, and he expresses his distaste for the fact I've killed a guy. But in any case, it very much feels like, inside my head, similar to what it's like when I have to decide if it's worth killing my commanding officer to secure a field promotion in 3:16, or forcing a fellow hero too close to the monster in Agon. <br/><br/>What I'm not sure of is if that's what I've brought to the game on my own, or if the game itself is invoking that sense in me. Are there players who strictly look at the cost/benefit ratio of their actions and never feel engaged by the fiction? Dunno.

Kill the corrupt king, and you'd get a "Kingslayer" epithet; talk your way out of being hanged for treason, you'd be "Silver-Tongued"; rescue puppies and orphans from a fire, you're "Friend to All Children".  Some NPCs would react differently to certain epithets, being down on king-murdering or susceptible to flowery words.  Other epithets wouldn't mean anything to them one way or the other (it ain't like there's a shortage of puppies or orphans, but whatever floats your boat).  Basically, proto-achievements for your character in that playthrough, or a more robust version of the karma tags from Fallout 1 and 2.<br/><br/>It seems like a good way to compartmentalize variant NPC reactions; rather than having every NPC's attitude affected by every thing the player did, you'd only worry about checking the much more manageable subset of epithets that are meaningful to that NPC.  But in this age of mandatory full voice acting and elaborate animation, that'd still be a lot of work.  It was probably easier to implement back when most of the conversation was handled via text, and could be tweaked and edited all the way up to the deadline instead of having to be written and recorded well in advance.  Which is too bad, I would've liked to have seen it in its full glory, instead of the watered-down versions that have been done since.<br/><br/>For example, Alpha Protocol almost kinda-sorta has an epithet system (Obsidian is almost entirely ex-Black Isle employees, after all), but they only give bonuses to Thorton's stats and rarely if ever affect interactions with NPCs.  And IIRC, Dragon Age 2 keeps track of what kind of dialogue options you pick for Hawke and shifts Hawke's other dialogue to match it in tone (so if you're snarky all the time in conversations, you'll be snarky in the cutscenes, too) but doesn't really change how the NPCs react to it.  But hey, maybe the technology of production will eventually work in our favor and either make it easier to do a lot of variant dialogue, or cheaper, or both, and we'll eventually get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327417/#Comment_327417" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T18:44:15+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  6:44PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2011 6:44PM by johnzo.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>What I'm not sure of is if that's what I've brought to the game on my own, or if the game itself is invoking that sense in me. </blockquote>\nIt's both, I think!

Can I have a few days to ponder a bit and write up a short description?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327420/#Comment_327420" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T19:20:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  7:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan: of course -- I'm eager to see what you come up with!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327422/#Comment_327422" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T19:21:35+00:00" title="June  1, 2011  7:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stories are like personalities - they're a framework our brains construct around a series of events in order to make sense of them. <br/><br/>When a series of events happen in a game, we construct a story about them. When a character acts in predictable and unpredictable ways, we imagine a personality that makes sense of it. The mistake that these designers make is to think that stories and characters are something you make before the game starts, and then communicate to the player. Stories and characters are things that the player discovers in play.<br/><br/>In terms of technological capabilities, games right now absolutely have the capacity to achieve this. Probably not with fancy voice-acting and graphics, but I don't know that those neccesarily drive sales. Maybe there's market research on that, but I haven't seen it.<br/><br/>Procedural techniques, such as the cellular automation that drives Minecraft, are fantastic at creating a world that reacts to the player in ways that are predictable in the small scale, but unpredictable on a large scale. The same techniques can be applied to characters in games.<br/><br/>"Scribblenauts" is able to have 10,000+ unique objects in the game, each of which act in the way you'd expect them to, but also in surprising ways. A T-Rex chases and eats a sheep. A sheep goes and eats a flower. They achieved this without having to code unique behaviours and interactions for each object by using a "tagging" system. A T-Rex has "hungry" and "carnivore" and "huge" and "scaly" and "made of meat". A sheep has "wooly" and "white" and "herbivore" and "hungry" and "made of meat". The engine of the game looks at tags, and works out proper behaviours. It sees that the T-Rex is a hungry carnivore, and it is bigger than the sheep, which is made of meat. It makes the T-Rex run its "chase and eat" script, which it shares with all other "living" objects. Complex behaviours and interactions, not predicted or scripted by the designers, with simple technology. You can absolutely do the same thing with characters or other objects in a computer game, right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

someone who's never played "ME2", that flowchart.. doesn't seem all that interesting.<br/><br/>Do you get really invested in those secondary characters when you play?<br/><br/>Anyway, compared to what could happen in a single session of a story game, even in a D&amp;D4E game that's all fighting, it sounds pretty ... blah.</blockquote>\nIt's sort of hit or miss. I believe some people have mentioned this, but if you go to the forums some people get absolutely absorbed by the characters...to the point of obsession. Kind of like anime-cons and such, you have die-hards.  I find the game series to be sort of a guilty pleasure in that I find the game kind of addicting but at the same time there are quite a few aspects I don't like about it. Both thematically and mechanically.<br/><br/>I'm of the school, I think of a lot of people here, that video games aren't the ideal medium to recreate the "cinematic" experience and Mass Effect very much tries to do that. And I don't really blame them for trying, since I think a number of us probably have that side that wants to tell a story in the visual form and if we happened to be VG developers. It would be tempting and games do offer that experience in a 20-30 hour format. But it is really stretched out and it isn't all good content (obviously). So partly illusion. Stating the obvious, kinda.<br/><br/>TL;DR It's like a TV show almost. If you like a character, it gels if not you are left in the dust. And sometimes it's mixed. <br/><br/>The ideal I think that games like Portal, Ico, Bioshock, Braid , Half-Life 2 (even) and few others have gotten at in some way or another is telling the story through the gameplay , visuals clues in the environment or sound design to convey the narrative instead of forcing it upon you. Now those games noticeably have moments where you forced to watch or perform something (sometimes ironically), so not perfect examples but I think they are steps in the right direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327456/#Comment_327456" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T23:47:44+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 11:47PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>I want to hear more about this, because I am a little skeptical.

Walton</cite>That's just not the priority of most game developers</blockquote>\nBut some are really trying. Remember all the hype around Fable? It was going to combine sim and story to create player driven narratives! I imagined killing some kid's father and the kid grows up to try and get revenge on me. I imagined choosing an NPC wife to marry and that would be the NPC that the dark lord kidnapped and I'd have to rescue. Turned out to not work, but they were at least trying.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lin_fusan</cite>I explained a preference less for morality in the game and more for consequence</blockquote>\nWord. If we leave it out of the game, morality can be a fruitful void. And there is a serious lack of consequences in computer games in general.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><cite>Posted By: lin_fusan</cite>His basic thesis was that with that kind of tracking and variant NPC reactions, it would multiply production, voice acting, animation, testing, and release times, so I had to scale back my "improvement" to a 3-alignment or 5-faction scale.</blockquote>\nYup.  Every boolean branch in your game's plot is going to roughly double your labor thereafter.  It's the tyranny of assets and QA.<br/><br/>Lately I've begun to feel like this is the cop-out, the 'explosive combinations' argument. Red Dead did it with that deed scenario, right? <br/>Anyhow, it doesn't have to be binary, every choice doesn't have to create a whole new game the way it does with a choose-your-own-adventure, because it's a computer. <br/>Like, here's a simple thing we can do (inspired by Danger Patrol &amp; Apocalypse World, where the threats you ignore escalate) to have choices have consequences: take your ME sandbox, cut half the missions, take the other half and make the player choose between them, and make the ones the player doesn't choose have consequences. You use the budget you saved cutting half the missions to implement those consequences. <br/>Now, you'll point out that a player on one run-through is only going to experience a game about three-eighths the size of the original uncut ME - (and the average player only sees 3/8ths of that content you lovingly created) but how many players play every single mission, anyhow? And this way, a player can play it twice, and get a very different result. (Sounds like maybe Alpha Protocol does something like this?)<br/><br/>I played Deus Ex 2 and Bioshock through twice - partly because they were short enough I could do that. <br/><br/>Speaking of underrated games, Deus Ex 2 is pretty underrated too, there really is massive amount of choice in that game. But choices don't really have consequences there, either, until the final one where you kingmake a faction.<br/><br/><br/>By the way, I think we're all talking about a particular kind of thing here. We want some Dogs in the Vineyard in our computer games. When we get to the final boss battle with the lasersharks, we want to say "I didn't sign up for this" and walk out and see what happens - <i>and have it be cool</i>. <br/>But we wouldn't want that in every game. Because the story in Portal and Portal 2 is perfect for what they are.  There's nothing to be gained from turning those games into nonlinear emergent whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo" title="AlexMayo"><img alt="AlexMayo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexMayo">AlexMayo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327519/#Comment_327519" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T09:31:54+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  9:31AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2011 9:32AM by AlexMayo.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad to see all the warm feelings re: <b><i>Alpha Protocol</i></b> - one of the more tragically underrated games in recent history.

Because of the structure and phone's memory limitations, every choice had to come back to a common set of dialogue. That meant that the NPCs' responses had to be appropriate to the player's right or wrong choice, but not so divergent that the story had to change. <br/><br/>It was challenging and a headache. I will never forget the meaning of "false choice" now, even if I still think it's a misleading term.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>Like, here's a simple thing we can do (inspired by Danger Patrol &amp; Apocalypse World, where the threats you ignore escalate) to have choices have consequences: take your ME sandbox, cut half the missions, take the other half and make the player choose between them, and make the ones the player doesn't choose have consequences.

Sandbox appears to be "allow the player to go anywhere they want, but don't force them to choose one mission over another" because you don't want the player to feel like they lost out. <br/><br/>I don't know if this is because someone on the design team with authority is concerned over the player's desire to control the game, or if there is a someone, like a producer, who would look at your structure and say, "Players are only going to play half of our content, that's a waste of manpower. Cut the other half."<br/><br/>I'm not knocking your above structure. This is more in line with what I wanted to play (in Mass Effect, when I discovered that there wasn't a timer to do that "we have to save the universe" missions, I started going on the side missions, but I definitely lost a lot of "agency" (I hate that word!) and immersion).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327535/#Comment_327535" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T10:42:49+00:00" title="June  2, 2011 10:42AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>Yeah, not a video game.</blockquote>\nIt's not?

It suffers from being released in a era when the console design tropes that make games like ME2 work had yet to be established. Plenty dead ends in it's design. a bold design that is a respectable and worth while failure. lots to learn from.<br/><br/>On another note I think the original deus ex hits a really nice believable balance, while it offered far less "choices" it really gave the player recognition for what they did during play. The nameless mod that came out for deus ex later had a really nice balance offering two core plot lines and a few smaller factions that you could join to. <br/><br/>About my favorite story game in recent years was mirrors edge, it's incredibly subtle but there is enough evidence to make a solid case that the game is about being a religiously motivated "terrorist". the choice to not use guns or use guns is what makes you an oppressed minority or an actual terrorist. there were a few points where the exicution of that ideal was a little weak but still a great game all around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327552/#Comment_327552" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T12:01:14+00:00" title="June  2, 2011 12:01PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote up my proposal for a <a href="http://www.berengad.com/blog/?p=59" rel="nofollow">story video game</a> a while ago; procedural, as well, but story-structure-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327571/#Comment_327571" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T13:19:16+00:00" title="June  2, 2011  1:19PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Remember all the hype around Fable?

Judging by the previews it seems like it will be pretty free in the way 1 was. Big open levels that follow each other in sequence, but during the level you can do whatever you want, kinda. Witcher 2 is definitely a good example of choices having consequences. Thief, maybe.<br/><br/>I agree with Jonathan that less graphics intensive/lo-fi is "better" for more story-gamey videogames because if you aren't blowing your manhours and budget on animating photorealistic polygons then you can shift your attention elsewhere. Red Dead Redemption might be an exception to this, but one that proves the rule. <br/><br/>Minecraft is great. Steve said something about happenstance and motivations above. Well, if you enter the Minecraft world just like that and wander around without purpose soon it's going to be night and you'll get eaten by monsters. And then you figure out, oh, monsters come out at night, I better build me a shelter. And then you hide and mine for metal and make yourself some weapons. You have motivations and objectives. That's why the first few nights in Minecraft are always the best, because it's very clearly a story about survival, there's tension, race against the clock etc. After that it can get boring soon, or actually just grind-y. Once your survival is more or less ensured the only thing you can do is keep exploring (not really that exciting after a while, because it's just empty wilderness, the occasional mine or dungeon you find is super-fun, but there should be potential to find <i>something</i> - something new, old, ruined, weird) or building huge structures (fun in the way playing with LEGOs is fun - but it's a grind).<br/><br/>Echo Bazaar is another game that doesn't get talked about enough in this context. They did precisely what Accounting for Taste said above about Ephitets. You do a job for the dock-workers on strike, your Connection: Dockworkers goes up, your Connection: Masters goes down. You save a young girl and you get a tag that you're her saviour. You start following a trail of clues and you get a tag that you're on this trail. Most modern videogames already do something like this with achievements - it's just that they haven't figured out how to make it a mechanical feedback loop yet. When you get an achievement it's just like a medal that you hand on a wall and that's it. Instead, like in Echo Bazaar which of these ephitets/tags/qualities/achievements you have unlocks or locks options or gives bonuses, offers specific quests, has people react to you differently etc.<br/><br/>I heard the new Elder Scrolls (Skyrim) is also trying to do something like this. You burn down a local sawmill, the city will have a wood shortage, prices will go up. Skyrim supposedly even introduces an element of GM improvisation to this! Say you accept a quest about finding a missing person. The game scans which nearby dungeons you haven't explored yet and puts the missing person in there (just a possible example). If the questgiver is friendly to you he'll give more info and help. Theoretically this thing could even specifically pick a NPC you've been interacting with a lot and befriended as the victim of an assassination attempt: it's like bangs or hitting on your beliefs. I'm very doubtful it will really work all that well in practice but it's a very ambitious approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327647/#Comment_327647" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T09:45:14+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  9:45AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>Yeah, not a video game.</blockquote>\nIt's not?

It's not the entire plot web; there are a bajillion other things that can happen that aren't related to the final mission.

They come from a place where stringing together a series of cool sequences in a coherent fashion is the norm.

The interface was going to be a rip-off of Ultima V.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never really did anything with it because I'm lazy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327744/#Comment_327744" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T23:52:16+00:00" title="June  3, 2011 11:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/116/1165904p1.html" rel="nofollow">Last part is up</a>.<br><br><b>Part 3: Questions</b><br/><br/>-- What stands out to you as the single best piece of storytelling in games to date, and why?<br/>-- Which person or team is making the most significant strides in this area?
