It's _great_ when you have an NPC roll a whole rake of 1s and 2s and the players just groan because they _know_ that if they escalate you're just gonna have some poor innocent buy the farm (or whatever) during your Take the Blow narration. I've seen players Give when I've rolled bad, just because they don't care to handle the Fallout.<br/><br/>Initiation scenes can be used to set up Relationships or backstory with the NPCs that populate the Town: the spotlight scene doesn't just have to exist in a vacuum. I often use the Initiation scenes as a Prologue, in a way (vaguely) like the intro set pieces that you get in Bond flicks. (c.f. GoldenEye, which set up some cool story stuff with Sean Beans 00whatever.)<br/><br/>Relationships are super-useful tools to drive the play towards conflict and create moral quandries: I often draw up a relationship map between the PCs and the Townsfolk as we're going through Initiations and play. Condemning Hezekiah the Stewards wife to a stoning is one thing: condemning your own mother to the same fate is quite another. (And if a PC balks at applying the Law as writ in the Good Book, then you can be _damn_ sure some Pharisee is going to bring him to task about it. <br/><br/>"<i>What do you mean she ain't gonna be stoned!? It says here in the Book of Zebulon that adulterers shall be stoned until they are dead. And it also says that the King or Judge shall be the first to throw a stone. So git to it young man, heah is a nice piece of limestone for you. Stone that filthy backsliding hoer.</i>")<br/><br/>Meta-advice here, but be sure to have _lots_ of dice. Like, loads.<br/><br/>Keep up a steady tempo of play. A cool, drama-filled, brutal, vibrant conflict can become an interminable bore if a PC spends 30-40 seconds agonising over what dice to put forward for each See and Raise.<br/><br/>This ain't canonical DitV, but the Demon dice are not just for NPCs IMO. When used sparingly, handing a PC a couple of extra Demon dice so that he or she can potentially win a conflict with the proviso that their Raise or See _must_ cause hurt to someone else can be effective at driving play towards conflict. Its human nature I guess, but some players/PCs just get the bit between their teeth and you can see that they just _have to win_ a particular conflict: great, the Demons will help them out there , and after those Demon dice have hit the table and a nasty OTT hurtful comment has been uttered - which _so will_ have repercussions later on - you can just Give in that conflict.

So loosen the requirements and allow relationships with affinity groups - orphans, widows, stewards, whatever - and then make sure there are some of whatever they pick in the town.  <br/><br/>Something else I do for one-shots is go through the list of NPCs out loud and let them pick people - "OK, there's a lady who could be somebody's aunt, there's a shop-keep about your age, there's a spooky little boy with one arm..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176068/#Comment_176068" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T11:05:31+00:00" title="October 24, 2008 11:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I'm going to say the opposite.  If this is your first time running Dogs then build your town all the way out to Hate &amp; Murder.  Be "simple" in the sense that you follow the town creation progression very carefully and don't go spinning things further than you need to get the next step.  Also be sure to answer all of the questions that come as the last step of town creation. I find those questions act as a great "editor."<br/><br/>For example, a common bad habit I have is to suddenly add in a new character when I come to the False Priesthood step and then when I get down to the "What does this character want?" question I find I can't answer it because he's just a body to fill in the "three" you need.  So I go back and rework things until there are actually three people involved who are independently motivated.<br/><br/>The only reason to keep a conflict going is (a) you have a reasonable chance of forcing the players to have to escalate and (b) you have reasonable chance of the players having to take Fallout with what you've got left.  If you can't mathematically accomplish those things, Give.<br/><br/>Play honestly.  Pick town issues that are important to you.  Have strong feelings about your characters.  This is the biggest social risk you take as Dogs GM because as previously stated the players will rip out these feelings and stamp on them.  This is a good thing.  It's the most rewarding part of GMing Dogs.  But don't feel like you have sacrifice the "integrity" of your characters just to "escalate" or push the players.  If the players gut punch and you and emotionally you can feel the character collapse, Give.<br/><br/>Infact, Giving is the most thematically powerful tool you have.  Giving is the way you acknowledge the players have struck at the emotional core of things.  And a lot of that is not just personal to you but the general vibe at the table as a whole.  It's a very difficult experience to describe but when you play with that honesty and vulnerability I mentioned you'll know it when it happens.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176073/#Comment_176073" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T11:15:58+00:00" title="October 24, 2008 11:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember that if you Give, you lose the stakes of the conflict but do not have to answer or take fallout from the last Raise aimed at you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRaises only count if you can't easily ignore them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a multi-way conflict, Raises that are described as affecting multiple characters do affect multiple characters and they all have to See the Raise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Fallout you take depends on how the Raise was described. If a Raise involves a gun but for intimidation not for shooting, you don't take shooting fallout.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeave plenty of Relationship dice unassigned. Encourage your players to assign these dice in play anytime they want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSplitting up the party is GREAT!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe community is small, you are likely related to someone in the town in some way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Book of Life can be interpreted in many ways. However the Dogs interpret it is the right way. Except that the Dogs can interpret things differently. Encourage this!<br/>\n<br/>\nDo not skip initiations! If you can incorporate relationships you plan to use in the campaign, all the better!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to view Raises as a series of questions. How badly do you want the stakes? Are you willing to sacrifice THIS for it? If the player says yes, then ask the question again aimed at something else the player may not want to sacrifice. Take note of what elements (people, places, things, ideas) in the town the players are interested in. Then target them with your Raises. If the player is in a situation where they can NOT See your Raise by dodging, blocking, or reversing... then they have to decide between escalating, sacrificing, or giving up. Which is a very dramatic and fun place to be!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't roll traits or town dice till you have to. Wait till after the players put forward a weak Raise using low d4s or d6s and then roll your traits and town dice in the hopes of being able to Reversing them!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to use the NPC alternate NPC dice rules from here: <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=294" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=294</a> It makes things flow much quicker with less prep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to use the Give rules from Afraid (horror version of the Dogs rules): <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/afraid-resolution.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/afraid-resolution.html</a> If either side Gives, they get to keep their 2 highest dice that they haven't used yet. Sometimes I like to target the players with "feel good" conflicts. Meaning conflicts they can easily win to establish the players as badasses or to help them learn the rules. This is a great place to have the NPCs give and save those dice for later!<br/>\n<br/>\nLead by example. The best way to encourage your players to sell the effects of "taking the blow" is to do it yourself in a convincing and entertaining manner. Show them by doing it first and then encourage them to do the same. Same with giving, escalating, and all other mechanics or procedures they may not be used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people I know do not like this, but I do! I like using the Escalate rules from Afraid (horror version of the Dogs rules): <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/afraid-resolution.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/afraid-resolution.html</a> When you escalate, not only do you get to roll more dice but you get to ignore someone's Raise! It makes a huge difference and has led to some of my favorite roleplaying moments. Before, sometimes we would escalate, roll a few extra dice and depending on what we rolled it didn't have very much impact. But ignoring a Raise and then attacking right back... that's pretty sick and tends to sell the fiction better for us.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people like to take the blow when it comes to talking because of the easier experience fallout. I say raise the stakes of your Raises! Words may not kill your character but people have gone to war over simple ideals. Try to force the players into admitting things they don't want to. Hit them where it hurts!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dogs have quite a bit of power. Make sure they can't solve the major conflicts in the first scene. Having witnesses, bystanders, and children around always helps. Throw obstacles in their way. Remember, a huge part of the game is judgment. If the Dogs don't know what they are judging, then the game isn't as much fun. Don't turn it into an investigation game where they have to find clues. But don't make it easy for them and don't overwhelm them with information. I find presenting the core conflict quickly minus contest and then unveiling why people are behaving the way they are is a great way to pace things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I've found that when the supernatural is obvious, the game loses a lot of steam. If a person is obviously possessed to the point where they have glowing eyes and are floating off the ground, it's much easier to just feel ok blowing them away. For me, if we include supernatural content, it's always restrained to the point where there is doubt to whether this is really happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure conflicts and situations are open. Meaning there is no one obvious way to solve it. This can help cause friction between the players (which rocks). If there is no right way, they will often come up with their own ways to solve it and then conflict over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n"One hard-won bit of advice - be alert to when conflicts actually start and put up dice. It's easy to be half-way through a conflict before anybody realizes it, and then all the best sees and raises have gone back and forth already."<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also experienced what Jason mentions above. You may want to be less subtle about when an NPC refuses to give the players what they want and start the conflict asap. It can be incredibly fun to play out a conversation using the conflict mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Nine times out of ten, the players will want to blame the town's Steward for at least some of the troubles."<br/>\n<br/>\nHell yes! Be prepared!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure there is more! Good luck. Dogs is a fantastic game!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176091/#Comment_176091" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T13:16:14+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  1:16PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Make your own town, always. <br><br>2) Make the first town simple. My "simple" is much like Jesse's -- Hate and Murder, but with a small cast of characters and sins simple and tightly packed. Save the Dogs making difficult judgments about the pride of a woman who spends too much time making lemonaide for later, for now start with someone dead. <br><br>3) Don't be too specific with your stakes. Make them a very lose "whats at stake is blah" without much elaboration. Like, "whats at stake is if he lives" or "whats at stake is his repentance" and less "whats at stake is if I shoot him in the head" or "whats at stake is if I can force him to say that he feels really bad about what he did because he shouldn't have screwed the horse before he killed it." You want to know what the arena is, but you don't want to stifle the possibility for things to grow organically in the conflict. (If you know the <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/afraid-resolution.html" rel="nofollow">stakes rules from Afraid</a>, use them. They're slightly clearer than those in Dogs.) <br><br>4) It says this in the book, but its worth repeating -- do not hide information from the players. Let them find shit out fairly easily, and make the hard part what they decide to do about it. Like, in one of my best games ever the PCs were riding up to town in the first scene when they met this sweet young girl who was so happy to see the Dogs, and proceed to tell them every single thing that was wrong in the whole town to the best of her knowledge. The players just sat there with their jaws hanging open, because there wasn't going to be any investigation. There was, however, a lot of shooting in the face. <br><br>5) If you want to make it hard for the PCs to win a challenge, you've got to do one of three things: <br><br>A) Split them up. A group of four or five Dogs, working together, can butcher a whole town if they get good rolls. Get them two or one at a time, however, and life can be tough on the poor Dogs. <br><br><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Hit them with a mob and/or a sorcerer. <br><br>C) Make them end up fighting for something they really aren't sure they want. This is my tricky secret to beating Dogs in conflicts, far more than the other two. If the Dogs are all like "yea, I'm going to shoot him in the face until his face is all shot!" and the guy starts crying and begging them not to orphan his children and starts revealing how he only killed the guy because he caught him stealing the medicine he needed to keep his kids alive... well, its shocking how fast Dogs with winning dice may give that conflict. (This is a very unsubtle example, you'll find plenty of opportunity for more subtle ones in play.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176131/#Comment_176131" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T16:25:54+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  4:25PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone.

I don't necessarily mean the relationships on the character sheet.  That's why Blood gets a free 1d6.  Due to the nature of The Faith's family structure RARELY does a player have an issue with the GM going, "Oh and your Aunt Sarah lives here."<br><br>Depending on how strongly you play up the gender issues in your game players often come to leverage gender.  Like a male PC wanting to take the male Steward aside and have a "man-to-man" talk or female PC wanting to take a wife aside for a little womanly advice.<br><br>After a town or two you will begin to see patterns in the players regarding what issues they react strongly to.  So mix those issues and have them pull in two different directions.  One player can't stand dominating men and another player gets bothered when children are in danger.  So upon arriving in town have the Steward mention how Brother Thomas might be beating his wife and how some people have been seeing a child they don't recognize wandering around the graveyard.  The first player sometimes says, "I'm going go have a little chat with Brother Thomas" and the second player says, "While you do that I'm going to go see what's up with the kid in the graveyard."<br><br>That's how I do it anyway.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176148/#Comment_176148" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T18:06:55+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  6:06PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caesar, I'd say:<br><br>1.

Sorcerers are fun, but I've found that when running for first-time players used to more typical games, they often fixate on the Sorcerer because they're used to the "Find the bad guy causing problems and kill him."  In Dogs, Sorcerers are a <em>symptom</em>, not the <em>cause</em>.  You have to deal with the underlying Pride. So I like stopping short of sorcery now, but that's just personal preference on my part.<br/><br/>I do always make sure the players know that anytime they want, they can use one of their available relationship dice to take a relationship to Demons, and call upon them for aid, gaining whatever Demonic Influence dice have been established (since that's Sorcery, that's 4d10 right there). What that means to their Dog's soul is <em>up to them</em>.

I think people mistake these ease and comfort with the choices being too "obvious" which is why they shy away from the supernatural.<br/><br/>To elaborate, when I run a town that has the supernatural dial turned low and there is no Sorcerer for people who are used to "hunt the bad guy" play, they stall out.  They keep asking questions.  They keep searching.  Because there is no bad guy they assume they're missing something and keep going and going and going and going until I finally have to say, "That's it guys.  You know it all.  There's nothing left."<br/><br/>However!  If I take the SAME town all  the up to Sorcery including overt supernatural effects those same players will find the Sorcerer, kill him and then deal with all the underlying stuff swiftly as if it were an afterthought.  And I agree 100% that Sorcerers are symptom and not a cause which is why I have no problem playing Dogs with the supernatural dial turned to 11 and don't think it detracts from the moral complexity of play.

In games with a lot of tactical crunchiness (D&amp;D, Shadowrun) a player who doesn't optimize his character may doom the rest of the party too.  Dogs isn't like that at all.  You can take "I'm a great cook 1d10" instead of "Deadly shot 1d10" and things will work out just fine.  I've even had a Dog not take a gun at all (admittedly, rare), although so far no one's refused a horse.<br/><br/>But remember that all the players have the right to express approval or disapproval over raises and sees and how experience is spent.  So if someone wants to bump up his "Hand of an angry god 3d10" trait to 4d10, it's fine for anyone who thinks that would be boring to say "Choose something else, please."  Personally I find traits over 3d10 or 4d8 make for less interesting conflicts, but if the players are OK with it I'll go along.  If the other players get tired of being run roughshod over in conflicts they have plenty of tools to deal with it.  In particular note that any 3 Dogs can strip a Dog or Steward of their standing using Three in Authority.  I don't recall ever seeing a Dog cast out, although I've seen plenty of Stewards removed from office (through word or gun), and a fair number of Dogs hang up their coats (or in one memorable case, throw it down into the barnyard muck so he could go off and murder his uncle, which he would have gotten away with too if a fellow Dog hadn't gunned him down right there and then).<br/><br/>A lot of the concerns people have about ways things might go wrong never seem to come to pass, once they're actually playing.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to hearing more about komradebob's happy ending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176286/#Comment_176286" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T22:24:39+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 10:24PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I guess I can post an AP thread, and Caesar-X and Chris P can join in the morning to explain the more mechanical end of things and what they remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176290/#Comment_176290" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T23:05:54+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 11:05PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2008 11:07PM by Pete.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Carl</cite>I do always make sure the players know that anytime they want, they can use one of their available relationship dice to take a relationship to Demons, and call upon them for aid, gaining whatever Demonic Influence dice have been established (since that's Sorcery, that's 4d10 right there). What that means to their Dog's soul is<em>up to them</em>. (That's per the rules, by the way.)</blockquote>\nHaha, I should take my own advice and read the damn book again because I had forgotten about this. However, I do remember why I had forgotten about this. (If that makes sense.)<br/><br/>In my mind, using those dice <b>must</b> have bad, hurtful, consequences that come out straight away or in a future conflict. (For however you define bad and hurtful.) But the players weren't doing that and were using the Demon dice essentially as free, no consequence dice. I may be doing the folks at my gaming club a disservice here, but they ain't down with the whole 'narrating bad shit is good (for drama)' and without prompting on my part they just would never do it. That's why I switched over to this style...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Indy Pete</cite><br/><br/>This ain't canonical DitV, but the Demon dice are not just for NPCs IMO. When used sparingly, handing a PC a couple of extra Demon dice so that he or she can potentially win a conflict with the proviso that their Raise or See _must_ cause hurt to someone else can be effective at driving play towards conflict. Its human nature I guess, but some players/PCs just get the bit between their teeth and you can see that they just _have to win_ a particular conflict: great, the Demons will help them out there , and after those Demon dice have hit the table and a nasty OTT hurtful comment has been uttered - which _so will_ have repercussions later on - you can just Give in that conflict.</blockquote>\n... because it is (was) just <i>easier</i> for folks to accept coming from the style of play that they are used to. I totally see now that that sucketh muchly... I need to play the game as written so that folks can all contribute ideas for 'bad' consequences when someone is tempted by those Demon dice. (We only ever play one shots of DitV so the consequences pretty much must play out in that session otherwise those Demon dice are freebies, which flies in the face of what happens when you deal with the Devil.)<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks Carl!
