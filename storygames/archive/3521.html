And many were weekend long games, so it wasn't as if you were losing a substantial portion of the available time to do the side activity.<br>\n<br>\nHandicapping for different character skill levels was a little bit of a problem. For chess, we removed pieces from the inferior player's side. For poker we experimented with different rules letting you peek at the other person's hand (one card), or see the flop cards before they came up (for Hold 'em), or things of that sort. But it was impossible to control for the factor where your opponent could see that you just used your special ability and therefore had an advantage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've also been in larps that used pretty extensive Microsoft Flight Simulator scenarios to represent piloting situations.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79324/#Comment_79324" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T11:36:38+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 11:36AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Birthright Campaign setting attempted to do this with D&amp;D.

That is, you're playing chess, make your roll, you get +3 on the opponent: You get to make three moves in a row, the opponent makes one, then you have another roll-off.<br/><br/>Way back when, when I was working on a post-apoc martial arts themed game, I adopted this game that a friend taught me, that came from the popular gambling manga "KAIJI", called "The Emperor and the Slave".<br/><br/>Basically, one person takes the role of the Emperor, the other side takes the role of the Slave. Each side gets five cards:<br/>The Emperor gets 4 crap cards and one King of Hearts, the "Emperor".<br/>The Slave gets 4 crap cards and one Jack of Clubs, the "Slave".<br/><br/>The Emperor plays the cards face down in front of him in order.<br/>The Slave plays his cards face down in front of the Emperor's cards. The idea is that the Slave tries to guess where the Emperor is, and puts the Slave in that position.<br/><br/>Then, starting from the Emp's/right Slave's left, they reveal their cards one at a time. <br/>* If the Emperor is revealed and there is no Slave in front of him, the Emperor wins.<br/>* If the Slave is revealed and there is no Emperor in front of him, the Emperor wins.<br/>* The Slave only wins if the card in front of his placed "Slave" was the Emperor.<br/><br/>After one hand, the roles are reversed. Play so each person gets three turns as Emperor.<br/><br/>It's kind of like a logic/psyche-out game: The Slave is the underdog, but through careful analysis of the opposing player, or just dumb luck, they can win. In the manga, whomever lost the game was killed. I figured that was a suitable "dark, gunfighter-y" game for a post-apoc setting, but never got around to actually using it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79343/#Comment_79343" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T12:47:54+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 12:47PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading this and seeing the chess suggestions, I find I'm apparently over-sensitive because I wince at them.

What's the point of getting together for a storytelling activity and interrupting it with a game of modified-to-reflect-the-story-game poker or chess?  I ask because I've tried this in the past and never had a positive experience -- the modified game doesn't really feel like that game &amp; the RPG element is curtailed.  I'd like to know what sort of experience you'd want to create using this method.<br/><br/>I had an idea many years about about playing in a GURPS Mecha game that blended together with tabletop Battletech.  It never got off the ground, because one side was more interested in one activity than the other -- in the end, it felt like I should have just suggested a Battletech day over at my place separate from our RPG night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79344/#Comment_79344" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T12:54:48+00:00" title="July  3, 2007 12:54PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two words: <a href="http://site.wcbo.org/content/e381/index_en.html" rel="nofollow">Chess Boxing</a>.<br/><br/>Never done it, never really watched it, but I love the concept.

For some reason I grab a Rubik's Cube and hand it to a player and say that they've found Kibur's Cube (the name backwards - aren't I clever). So Jim, who knows how to solve the darn thing - albeit slowly - starts solving it. About two sessions later, he picks it up again and finishes it, really not having recalled that it was a magic item in the game. I note that he has done so, and go all quiet... I hadn't figured out what the magic item did if solved. Thinking that I had more time. Moreover, Jim hadn't understood that solving it in real life did anything. In game they were completely baffled as to what it did.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... I gave him wishes. I figured why not go big? What's maybe more important was that I improvised this, and pretended like I'd planned it all along.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell... you've never seen a player with wishes less excited to have them. Stunned, sorta. But it was pretty lame. I'm pretty sure he could tell that I'd made up the reward right on the spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure what lesson this teaches... don't roll on random tables for magic items?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81752/#Comment_81752" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:49:09+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:49AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did it in LARP - the idea of using a RTS game during a giant battle is totally classic, though!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81758/#Comment_81758" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T11:59:02+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:59AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Not sure what lesson this teaches... don't roll on random tables for magic items?</blockquote>\n"Improvisation takes practice, and you didn't quite have enough experience to make it work." <br><br>OR "Improvisation is cool, but doesn't guarantee success any more than pre-planning does."<br><br>Probably a bit of both.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81802/#Comment_81802" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T14:25:23+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  2:25PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One time there was a gunfight in a game, so I pulled out a gun and shot one of my players.<br><br>No, not really.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_82137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/82137/#Comment_82137" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T18:33:08+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  6:33PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not exactly but.<br><br>When playing traditional RPGs was our habit to include some sort of enigma.

You can play it independent of D&amp;D, and that's how I've played it. But within the context of D&amp;D there are rules for your character's abilities having an impact on the game. (I don't remember the particulars. Rogues can do certain things to cheat the game, I think. And other stuff. Maybe even character rewards for winning.) It's a fun game on its own. But you have to be careful about the starting gold or it'll play indefinitely. <br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85534/#Comment_85534" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-04T11:11:34+00:00" title="August  4, 2007 11:11AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it would work for my group, for a few reasons:<br/><br/>1) There's me and 6 players. Any game that could involve everyone would probably take too long.<br/><br/>2) Logistics. Our game room setup means that for me to sit across the table from someone we'd have to rearrange alot of stuff, and I'd have to steal someone else's chair.<br/><br/>3) Character vs. PC skill. If, for example, we were to go with poker, and the player had no poker face while the PC had 15 ranks in gambling, trying to play that out would be awkward at best.<br/><br/>That said, I could see perhaps doing it if the game in question were fast and simple, and the outcome of it was going to be important to the characters.<br/><br/>A thought just struck me: using poker you could play straight hands of draw poker. No betting means no need to worry about poker faces. To include character skill you roll whatever the Gaming skill is for the game and use the level of success to give the participants extra cards. So instead of playing five card draw one guy is playing six card draw, another eight card draw, and the card shark with massive skill and a little cheater's sleight of hand is playing fifteen card draw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
