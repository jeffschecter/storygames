For example, a monster with an attack bonus of +2 might have a THAC0 of 18 or thereabouts, so if the character has a leather armor with AC 8, their target number to roll under would be 10.<br/><br/>Note that the "this is what you need to roll under to defend" target number is essentially the same as "this is what the monster needs to roll over to hit you" target number would be (barring the treatment of ties, etc. minor issues).

Then the enemies' attack value is subtracted from that before the roll. TDAV0 is calculated as follows: 18-AC. Done.<br/>(The enemies attack value, if you don't already have a formula for it, is 2+half HD. So a HD six enemy has attack value five. If you're using modern monsters, just use thexr attack bonus as their attack value.)<br/><br/>Here's the math:<br/>Ascending AC 15 getting hit by a +3 attack: natural die rolls 12 and higher hits the player.<br/>Ascending AC 15 is equal to descending AC 4.<br/>18-4 is 14, so that's the TDAV0. Note the TDAV0 value separately on the sheet and keep AC.<br/><br/>Our hero gets hit again by the +3 menace. 14-3 is 11. 11 or under means the player successfully defended, which means that 12+ hits. So we're done.<br/><br/><br/>With roll high it's way easier (no subtraction) and you can keep descending. All you need to do is <em>either</em> increase all ACs by three, <em>or</em> (more work but less intrusive on the player-facing materials), increase all monster attack values by three (or just keep it and accept that 15% of rolls are changed, in favor of the players).<br/><br/>Then to defend, add your AC with the monster's AV and roll equal or higher.<br/>Descending AC 4 + AV 6 = 10+ result successfully defends, meaning there are 11 successfully defending results and nine results where the attack lands, same probs as before.<br/><br/><br/>Wishing for low d20 rolls puts a curse on a die set, that's just science.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462257/#Comment_462257" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-21T05:33:35+00:00" title="April 21, 2017  5:33AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero posted while I was writing.

Also, in B/X, dexterity already affects AC, see page B12.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> OK, looks like you mean the PC's combat bonus, and the monster's capabilities never come in. Can work. Looks like you get hit against weak monsters, about 10-20% less often than you'd otherwise get, and against strong monsters the difference is even bigger. But this hyper-bounded-accuracy can be a good design feature. More static DEF scores, and HP and damage output (through numbers of attacks, primarily) are the biggest differences as levels and monster HD go up.<br/><br/><b>Edit again:</b> Wait, no... the PCs will get harder and harder to hit, even without getting better armor, because their combat bonus is going up.

There are many ways to get seemingly reasonable numbers, and the particulars depend on the exact feel you wish to attain.<br/><br/>Dexterity score is unsuited as a base target number for this if you're using traditional AC values as well, as the AC range is ~10 points, while the range for Dexterity is even more - you'll easily get characters that combine a high Dex with a good armor, making them near impossible to hit for the monsters. Including the character's to-hit bonus only makes the problem worse.<br/><br/>Assuming you're still stuck with the descending AC (I would personally drop it for this, as you're getting so far from the basics mathematically anyway), and insist on factoring in character DEX and other such matters, I would suggest something like this:<br/><br/>Characters have two or more defense scores, representing alternative defenses. All characters have a passive defense (PD) and a dodge score (DS) at minimum, for instance, and you could also have e.g. a shield block (SB) or magical defenses (MD) depending on character particulars. The player chooses which of these defenses they use situationally against various attacks; there's room to season the set-up with tactical particulars according to taste - perhaps AC is usable in conjunction with the other scores, for example, so you get two "layers" of defense for one, for example, or maybe using the DS gives you a cumulative -1 penalty to your next action as you pay attention to your defenses instead of attacks.<br/><br/>So a character has a set of defense scores. The benefit here is that you can fine-tune the individual scores in a more reasonable manner, without having to account for the various ideas like armor, dexterity, combat skill (to-hit bonus) and so on all in one super-score. Much easier to make the math work this way. For instance, here's how you might calculate a few of those scores:<br/><br/><b>Passive defense:</b> representing a character's armor and the basic difficulty of executing an attack, the passive defense is "always on", but fumbling the defense breaks the armor and armor-penetrating attacks may penalize the roll. The target number is equal to 20-[character's armor class].<br/><br/><b>Dodge score:</b> represents the character's combat awareness, footwork and willingness to "work" for their safety. The DS can be used only against attacks the character is aware of, and using it implies free movement in the combat space, so probably means giving ground. Multiple uses per round are penalized cumulatively. The target number is equal to [character's DEX]+[character's to-hit bonus]<br/><br/>As you can see, the idea I'm shooting for is that individual characters may prefer to use different defensive strategies, as represented by the different defense scores, but the nature of the enemy also affects the choice of defense. For example, you'd prefer to dodge against armor-piercing attacks, while dodging would not work in tight quarters or against enemies with multiple attacks. And we can create more defense options the same way, as the proceedings of play suggest. For instance:<br/><br/><b>Shield block:</b> sort of like dodging, except not so much based on foot-work as it is on adept use of the shield. Can only use as many times per round as you have attacks, so probably once only. Fumbling the block breaks the shield, of course. The target number is [character's STR]+[character's to-hit bonus]+[2 if DEX higher than STR].<br/><br/><b>Parry:</b> pretty much like shield block, except not as good. Penalties to next attack because you're using your weapon for defense. The target number is [Shield block] -2.<br/><br/><b>Magical defenses:</b> particularly useful against magical attacks. Defensive spells add to this defense as well as their normal effects. Use requires attention similar to blocking with a shield, and only characters with spell-casting ability can use magical defenses. Target number is [20-appropriate save]+[caster level], but it is halved against mundane attacks.<br/><br/>Something like that, perhaps? The formulae can of course be greatly simplified by switching all factors to go "one way" - as it is, the old D&amp;D numbers are pretty wacky, what with Abilities going up, AC going down, to-hit going up, saves going down...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462264/#Comment_462264" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-21T07:47:52+00:00" title="April 21, 2017  7:47AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2017 7:52AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of using the monster's to-hit bonus as a "bottom failure range" for the roll, although it brings with it some extra math for high-level situations.

Handling of ties and different flavours of historical D&amp;D mean that even if we specify "descending AC" I don't know if your "unarmoured human" is at AC 12 or 10 or something else. Presumably you'll work out the precise numbers to your satisfaction once the general idea is to your satisfaction.\n<blockquote>What is the range at the bottom for the monster to hit? The highest would have to be 10 correct?</blockquote>\nPresumably you'd want to derive this directly from the attack bonus (or THAC0, or the monster HD, whatever you use). I personally would go with +1 per HD for monsters, so e.g. a character in leather armor (AC 8) against a 3 HD monster gets hit on 1-3, dodges on 4-12 and again gets hit on 13-20. Of course a particular monster known for its accuracy could get a special bonus or penalty, but the "HD is attack bonus" thing has served me well in general (and it's pretty textual, too, for many D&amp;D editions).<br/><br/>(You can have the effects be different on the different hit ranges, as you suggested earlier. Note that the "bottom range" tends to increase as monsters grow more dangerous, while the "upper range" decreases as characters improve their defenses. This probably means that the special qualities of a bottom range hit should be something particularly significant for high level characters - status effects and critical hits - while the upper hit range should be particularly relevant for low-level characters, as that's where they take most of their hits.)<br/><br/>In low-level play your defense target numbers should stay pretty cleanly in the 10-20 bracket, while the monster hit bonus would probably stay low-ish - if you go with the "attack bonus = HD" math, then a monster with hit range 1-10 (10 HD) will be quite rare at low levels. Most of the time the three ranges (bottom hit range, dodge range and upper hit range) will line up neatly.<br/><br/>My strategy for adapting this framework for high level play would be to accept the fact that sometimes players manage to push their defense scores to 20 and beyond, and sometimes a monster will have more than +10 for their attack bonus. You'll just need to be prepared for the eventuality, so as to make the numbers meaningful. (Even the bare fact that I like to use circumstance modifiers to rolls makes this observation obvious: if you allow a character with heavy armor to get a defense bonus from a clever stratagem, you're basically saying that a sub-zero AC is situationally permissible. No need to have magic bonuses for that to occur!)<br/><br/>Simple initial fixes are as follows:<br/><b>*</b> A natural '20' on the defense roll always fails, even if you have a higher score.<br/><b>*</b> Matching your dodge value always dodges, even if it is within the monster's hit range.<br/><b>*</b> Either the attacker or the defender can "move the window" by giving an equal penalty to the monster hit range and the defense score. You could call this a "mighty blow" or something, but the core idea is that when the monster has a +15 to attack and the defense score is 25, the defender should take a -5 to both of those numbers instead of rolling them as is. This "moving of the dodge window" could be an interesting tactical option in general if the two hit ranges have slightly different consequences on a hit - sometimes you prefer to hit on the upper range, perhaps, while at other times you prefer the lower range.<br/><br/>Note that it is possible for the monster's hit range and the defense range to overlap thoroughly. If a basic human with AC 10 dodges on a 10 or lower, and the monster has a +10 hit range, the human's pretty screwed - it's the same situation you get in all D&amp;D versions with extreme numbers. Generally we accept that there is such a thing as an almost certain hit, and give that 1/20 chance of an upset (represented here, perhaps, by the "automatic dodge" when you hit your dodge target number).\n<blockquote>How would you handle character advancement? If you started at 20-[AC] (which I like by the way). For passive defense, nothing improves, save the character getting better armor. Though Dodge, Shield Block, Parry, Magical Defense (I'd call it Counter-Spell) could improve as you gain levels.</blockquote>\nI'll point out that my own houserules use something similar to this layered defense idea, and I've absolutely grown fond of the notion that armor class is a relatively static number. It has a very good feel for me. Consider:<br/><b>*</b> AC has never improved as a function of level in D&amp;D before the very latest editions. I think it's part of the higher-order logic of the game that AC "stops working" at high levels, although there are different strategies for answering the "what then?" question - the oldest being, of course, that "you don't need AC when you have a boatload of hit points instead".<br/><b>*</b> Even a low-level character can get in the neighbourhood of the best possible AC with enough money, which is sort of interesting: you max out on (this type of) defense early on, if you're willing to swallow the expense and the tactical handicap of heavy armor. It's very important to the low-level dynamics that even a 1st level fighter is actually pretty tough on goblins when in an optimal situation.<br/><b>*</b> The fact that it is difficult to scale armor-based defense, while skill-based defense is "easy" (as in, the game has enshrined mechanisms for becoming a demigod by leveling up) means that it becomes increasingly feasible for higher-level characters to skip the armor altogether. I think this is really cool (although I would never allow the situation to occur where a high-level build couldn't derive <i>any</i> use out of armor).<br/><b>*</b> Depending on your character build rules there's nothing in particular preventing you from assigning high-level characters some minor improvements to armor class, too. A feat like "armor expert" for a +2 to AC while wearing any, or all 9th level Fighters get +5 to their AC against enemies lower in HD than they are, or whatever. No big deal, all up to the style of the campaign.<br/><br/>In a strategic sense, remember the overall picture: D&amp;D originally operates under the assumption that low-level characters are protected by luck (the miss chance on attacks), while high-level characters are protected by HP attrition. One could justifiably argue that allowing defenses to scale <i>at all</i> as a function of leveling means that you should remove most of the HP escalation, or ensure that higher-level monsters cause proportionally more damage. Otherwise you make characters invulnerable, if they have both good defenses and lots of HP.<br/><br/>In general, though, I like the idea that your basic defense that "always works" is armor class, but it's a defense that can't be optimized and gamed significantly, so your focus in character improvement is on the belt of "active defenses", whatever they may be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462277/#Comment_462277" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-21T11:49:57+00:00" title="April 21, 2017 11:49AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more type of relatively common defense, by the way:<br/><br/><b>Acrobatic Defense:</b> this is when a martial artist or similar derringdo-character dodges attacks - it's like dodge, except fancier. The formula is [DEX or WIS]+[hit bonus]+[bonus for high WIS/DEX]-[armor penalty for heavy armor], and it doesn't take penalties for multiple enemies, so it's better than dodging most of the time. However, hits on the lower range are aggravated (+1 damage per damage die or something, I dunno), and characters who are not Fighting-Men or otherwise appropriately martial have to halve their acrobatic defense score.<br/><br/>Just an example of the sort of derring-do you can get up to with the concept of layered, optional defenses. Presumably characters would mostly use the "fancy" acrobatic defense option against hordes of weaker enemies.<br/><br/>In summation: let me say that this sounds like a pretty interesting system, actually. I could see myself using this in a more Basic-derived mechanical framework (as opposed to the unholy demonspawn I currently play), despite not really caring myself about the "who rolls the dice" issue.
