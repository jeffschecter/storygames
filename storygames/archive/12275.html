This one is more hardcore theory than the Furious Five.<br/><br/><b>The thought is:</b> the rise of games like Apocalypse World which move from "the GM (or another specific player) has final say when X occurs in the fiction" to a more egalitarian phrasing of "when X occurs" place greater emphasis on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdeterminacy_(law)" rel="nofollow">underdeterminacy</a> of the fiction in roleplaying.<br/><br/><b>To back up a bit:</b> my sense is that Forge-influenced RPG thought has traditionally viewed the fiction as completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory" rel="nofollow">indeterminate</a>, that the same fictional situation could be interpreted completely differently by different players and that some player ultimately has to step forward and use their social authority to interpret the situation and create a shared understanding. Bill White and I had a conversation on the Structured Freedom forum a while back and he asserted, quite correctly I think, that <i>the fiction cannot interpret itself</i>, meaning basically that the "proper" interpretation of the shared fiction is not objectively evident.<br/><br/><b>However:</b> Vincent -- both in AW and is his Anyway discussions about fictional positioning -- seems to think that's not the whole story, and I suspect that he's correct as well.  The fiction in roleplaying -- the things we communicate at the table that get cobbled together to determine "what happens" are not without shared meanings.  Indeed, it would be stunning if we didn't have, to one degree or another, some shared understanding of what's going on because <i>that's kinda the whole point</i>, right?  So I would argue that the issue isn't really that the fiction is completely indeterminate, it's just <i>underdeterminate</i>.<br/><br/>To paraphrase and flat-out steal from Wikipedia on underdeterminancy: <i>knowing the meaning of the words and other communication that flows between us at the table IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT ONLY TAKES US SO FAR in resolving controversies. Due either to ambiguity or vagueness, the meanings alone may not always lead players to the same unique interpretation of what is occurring, but they do point the players in one or more directions.</i><br/><br/>So when Vincent throws down a rule that says: "when X occurs, do Y"; that's an intentional (?) contraction of "when <i>you think that</i> X occurs, <i>tell the other players and prepare to</i> do Y."  It's basically telling you to make the smaller interpretive jump from the underdeterminate fiction to a shared understanding by invoking the rule (i.e. making a move), rather than assuming that the fiction doesn't help you at all and attempting to make a looooooong interpretive jump from meaningless fictional color to "this is a conflict now."<br/><br/>The latter attempt feels more arbitrary in play, right? Because it's not building on the shared understanding that already exists.  It's like "Oh yeah, and then ninjas attack!"  But in AW, even the most random insertions into the fiction or orders to roll dice are heralded by fictional (or in some cases, mechanical) predecessors: you threaten badness or totally blow a roll.<br/><br/>Now, clearly there is a limit on how determinate the fiction (or the rules, really) can be.  Ultimately, Bill's right, it can't interpret itself.  But Vincent's also correct that it can lead us much further down the road to a shared understanding than we might normally give it credit for.  "Following the fiction" is definitely a thing.  As for just how far we can follow it before one of more players have to step in and say "this is what this means"... I'm not sure we've discovered that yet.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275214/#Comment_275214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T15:03:13+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  3:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes, yes and yes.<br/><br/>Sorry, I have nothing more to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275219/#Comment_275219" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T15:16:43+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  3:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel I'm missing something.<br/><br/>I agree about it being somewhat undeterminate, or rather, undetermined (because there are things to be done that can take us farther), which is not the same as being indeterminate, because it CAN be, it just hasn't been automatically so.<br/><br/>Ok, so I agree with that overall.<br/>And then what?

You know, clouds, arrows, cues and all that. I think what Jonathan is getting at that <i>Moves</i> bring us closer to a consistent shared interpretation of the fiction on a moment-to-moment basis than other game mechanics do.<br/><br/>You know it's the old "higher ground" thing. Who gets to say my elf has the higher ground? How do we establish that in the fiction, how do we interpret it. In D&amp;D I'd say I jump on a table and then maybe or maybe not the GM gives me a +2. It's a vague and unclear leap from cloud to dice. We might get into an endless discussion about whether or not my elf is on the table and whether or not it counts as high ground.<br/><br/>In some other theoretical game, I spend a Tactics point and I get +2 for high ground. If I actually narrate what's going on in the fiction doesn't necessarily matter. I'm making a dice-to-dice mechanical thing.<br/><br/>Moves, on the other hand, state that when <i>X happens in fiction</i>, we'll do Y. "When you seize the higher ground." Poison'd was a venture into that same territory. It's a concrete fictional cue that's predetermined. It brings us on the same page about what's going on in the fiction at the same time as engaging the dice.<br/><br/>There is a question that a lot of games don't answer at all, which is "When do we go to the dice?". Trad games often have no instructions for this at all. A lot of games just say something like "when the result is unclear". Dogs in the Vineyard for example, tells you "when there is a conflict". When is there a conflict? Who decides? We must interpret the fiction. There's a big interpretative leap from what's going on in the fiction to actually taking the dice out. It's like, one moment we're just talking about what's going on and the next we're rolling and it's like a break.<br/><br/>What AW is doing is that in a hypothetical, utopian game, those leaps are smaller, because the rolls emerge directly from moment-to-moment fiction play. When do I roll +cool? <i>When I'm acting under fire</i>.<br/><br/>(I hope I'm firing in the right direction.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275228/#Comment_275228" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T16:03:30+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  4:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor's on basically the same page, I think.

Similarly, there are no mechanical disadvantages on a character unless the GM specifically spends one of their "secrets" and thus forces a roll that might apply a penalty trait on a character. If there's no meaningful change in a situation, why go to the dice? If you go to the dice, something must have changed, so get off your arse and start describing it... <br/><br/>There should be a synergy happening. between story and mechanisms (again...leftward pointing arrows, rightward pointing arrows...etc.). The fiction may not be able to interpret itself mechanically, and two different people may have different interpretations of how the fiction and the mechanisms correspond, but at least if a communal agreement can be held on the two extremes, then a consensus in the middle is more likely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275248/#Comment_275248" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T18:12:50+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  6:12PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

An indeterminist about the law claims that nothing counts as law until it has been declared to be by an official with the requisite power. Because this sounds all spooky and left-wing, critics of the position on both sides of the political spectrum are fond of saying that indeterminists believe that the law isn't "objective," in the sense that the constitution and subsequent legislation don't even <i>constrain</i> what can or can't be counted as law. But this is of course an entirely different (and self-evidently preposterous) claim.<br/><br/>The notion of indeterminacy first came up in a rigorous context in the early discussions of quantum mechanics, when Bohr and others argued that it's always indeterminate what the spatial positions are of certain subatomic particles. They certainly didn't mean that any subatomic particle could be just anywhere. It later became important in the philosophy of linguistics - W.V. Quine famously argues that when one is translating a radically unfamiliar language, it's impossible to come up with a single empirically optimal translation manual. But he didn't think that one's observations of what native speakers said are <i>entirely irrelevant</i> to what one should think that they are trying to communicate.<br/><br/>So the upshot is that the word "underdeterminate" is being used throughout this discussion to mean what "indeterminate" actually means. And the larger moral of the story is, if you want clarity in theoretical discussions, don't trust the hack amateur philosophers who set the conversational agenda for America's inane and hopelessly broken legal system.<br/><br/>End of sermon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275265/#Comment_275265" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T20:05:00+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  8:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good to me, Mark.

So someone who subscribed to a very radical form of indeterminism might say that two interpretations of a story which involve contradictory claims about what a text (or gamer) actually <i>says</i> could be equally justified (e.g. When the GM said to Fred, "You killed the troll with your axe," Fred's paladin both did and did not kill a troll with an axe). A more moderate form of indeterminism would deny this possibility, but insist that equally justified, contradictory claims might be possible about the background information that one needs in order to understand the story  (e.g. that Sherlock Holmes both was and wasn't less than seven feet tall). An even more moderate version of indeterminism would deny this possibility, but claim that it's possible to make equally justified, contradictory assertions about the motivations of characters within the story (e.g. that Hamlet both was and wasn't faking his madness).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275277/#Comment_275277" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T00:03:35+00:00" title="June 10, 2010 12:03AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>So when Vincent throws down a rule that says: "when X occurs, do Y"; that's an intentional (?) contraction of "when<i>you think that</i>X occurs,<i>tell the other players and prepare to</i>do Y."  It's basically telling you to make the smaller interpretive jump from the underdeterminate fiction to a shared understanding by invoking the rule (i.e. making a move),</blockquote>\nTo expand on this, it seems to me that the rules for the moves are themselves interpretations -- and that by bringing them into play you are creating, automatically, a shared interpretation of the fiction. Moves therefore serve as interpretive anchors around which the rest of the fiction can be oriented. Similarly, proposing that something is a move is conditional on the player who is performing the action agreeing -- it may turn out that they didn't intend to Go Aggro, that they were in fact aiming for something quite different. In this way calling for a move/roll also calls for a moment of group interpretive judgment, which supports the creation of a more-determined-than-average series of fictional events.<br/><br/>(At this point I notice that Gregor already kind of said this, oh well.)<br/><br/>I guess a question for me is whether or not it is true that AW rules are doing this in a different way from, say, Sorceror rules or (more likely) PTA rules. Do we have to go looking <i>in the fiction</i> more in AW than we do in PTA, before we can engage the mechanics? Does PTA make it easier to do so, or is there some difference in the likelihood that a conflict seems contrived or leapt-towards in one or another systems?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275284/#Comment_275284" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T01:10:57+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  1:10AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2010 1:43AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>Virtually every trad game I've played with functioning communication at the table has played off <i>extremely</i> specific and active fiction.  All that's needed is an occasional "are we on the same page here?" check before committing to advancing the fiction.  That is, "I assume I can jump this chasm, right?  (sees no dissent)  So, I do!" as opposed to, "I jump this chasm!"<br/><br/>When it's important that the fiction be determinate, then we determine it.<br/><br/>If your "we" who is underdetermining the fiction is "story gamers", I'm not sure whether that's a failing or a preference.  If it's a failing, well, I think it's fixable via techniques like the above.  I will happily wave my cartoons at you if you'd like to see my attempts to communicate these things (albeit in the context of a realistic, immersion-y game).<br/><br/>As for authority (as mentioned in your OP):<br/>The way I see it, "who has the authority to determine what" ought to be an intentional design feature.  In certain games with certain goals, "look to the GM" might be toxic, or frustrating, but in others it might be optimal.  If your point is just that not <i>all</i> games should be like that, and it's nice to have egalitarian options too, then I wholeheartedly agree.  I will also infer a position that games clearly communicating their fiction-determining authorities is a good thing, and agree with that as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275289/#Comment_275289" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T01:51:58+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  1:51AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just blooged about this very point! <br/><br/><a href="http://simoncarryer.blogspot.com/2010/06/fiction.html" rel="nofollow">The Fiction</a><br/><br/>In short, Jonathan, I got your back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275337/#Comment_275337" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T09:46:39+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  9:46AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2010 9:50AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My reaction to this is pretty much the same as Dave:<br/><br/>Isn't this exactly how a lot of/most traditional games work? For example, if you try to hit someone with your sword, you have to roll "to hit". If you hit someone (and sometimes that can happen without a roll, I suppose), you have to roll damage. If you want to roll "to hit", you can't just say you want to--you have to actually pull out your sword and swing it. From a hypothetical game manual: "When you search a room for secret doors, roll one die. On a 1, the GM must tell you what secret doors are there."<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is well-designed in terms of the moves not being boring, and more flexible because the moves cover more different situations, plus the directions for how to play and how to run the game are very clear (compared to many older games). But, other than that, is this really something new we're talking about?<br/><br/>Is it just the argument that we can bring this feature back into "modern" designs? If so, it's a good one, but it seems to me it's one Vincent's already made very thoroughly on his blog (with all those right-pointing arrow posts).<br/><br/>Looking forward to hearing more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275338/#Comment_275338" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T09:52:58+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  9:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I just blooged about this very point!<br/>.</blockquote>\nThat's very nice!

If you imagine a continuum between looking at something in real life, like the number on a die, or whatever, and someone making an arbitrary decision, looking to the fiction exists somewhere in the middle.

They'll brush off the seat first, waggle the handlebars, roll it back and forth a couple of times, then swing their leg way up and over the thing to get on. What they're doing is establishing your assent to the bike. They're saying "the seat is this far off the ground" "the handlebars are this far apart" "It's a bike, see?", so that when they hop on that thing and start riding, we know what's happening and we accept it.<br/><br/>It's the same in roleplaying. Rules that help us establish and agree to the fiction first, that let us brush off the seat and kick the tyres, allow us to rely on the fiction a lot more robustly when it comes to resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275465/#Comment_275465" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T02:00:54+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  2:00AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>From a hypothetical game manual: "When you search a room for secret doors, roll one die.
