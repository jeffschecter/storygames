You die extremely easily, there is very little instruction as to what the game is about (i.e. a goal) and you don't know if you're supposed to just run when you see a ghost or actually attempt to interact with it. Apparently if flub one card draw, you just die, which also seems capricious. Sorry to sound so negative, but that was my only experience with the game.<br/><br/>Thoughts: <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2063.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2063.0</a><br/><br/>Record of play: <a href="http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=420&amp;page=1#Item_33" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://snailspace.forgreatjustice.net/comments.php?DiscussionID=420&amp;page=1#Item_33</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346997/#Comment_346997" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T13:59:27+00:00" title="October 26, 2011  1:59PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm planning on playing tomorrow, so I'll have smarter things to say then.

It plays in around 30 minutes with 2 players; a GM playing the murderous ghost and a player playing a person who will either escape or die. <br/><br/>Both player and GM have their own Choose Your Own adventure style booklets. Choices 1 person makes in their booklet causes the other person to flip to a different page in theirs. <br/><br/>The resolution mechanic uses a basic deck of playing cards to great effect.<br/><br/>The game requires the GM to make up a lot of stuff on the fly. For people who love roleplaying games, even if they have never GMed before, it is easy. We had problems when playing with 2 players who have never roleplayed before or done any sort of improv. <br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347006/#Comment_347006" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T16:05:36+00:00" title="October 26, 2011  4:05PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our game was very dull, there just wasn't enough explanation of what it was about.

Then it's up to you to misdirect and narrate it into the fiction.<br/><br/>For instance, your booklet might say, "If the player decides to leave the room, have them draw a card. If the card is [...] then a ghost appears and begins chasing them. Describe what it looks like, and give it scary eyes." Then it's back to the player to choose something they want to do. It feels very open-ended, like a freeform RPG, but in fact the booklet guides you through each step.<br/><br/>It's a "challenge", in the sense that, yes, you can die pretty easily. But (according to Vincent, anyway), you can get better at the game and learn to improve your chances of survival. I escaped alive in my first game, so it's certainly possible!<br/><br/>It's surprisingly creepy and atmospheric to play, assuming you have an MC with at least a modicum of imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347025/#Comment_347025" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T22:41:37+00:00" title="October 26, 2011 10:41PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How would you folks rate it for people who are both pretty creative and have a fondness for ghosty stuff, but probably haven't played SGs or RPGs before?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347027/#Comment_347027" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-26T23:12:44+00:00" title="October 26, 2011 11:12PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I want to say is the death thing didn't seem like that big of a deal to me.

That is one of the main features of the game both B and I noticed when we played. We had lots of unanswered questions about the ghost and the pc. Both of their stories were cut deliciously short by the ghost killing the pc.<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347048/#Comment_347048" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-27T08:02:06+00:00" title="October 27, 2011  8:02AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2011 8:02AM by Evan_Torner.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Note too that it's a "Trauma Games" production, which means you're likely going to be murdered.

I played with a non-gamer who made it pretty clear that he'd never been exposed to anything of this sort... and, then, when we were discussing the game afterwards, several times accidentally referred to his role in the game as "the DM" instead of "the MC".

[disclaimer: I have not played yet (I got the playtest, which I read over a couple of times but I didn't find the time to play, I'll buy the pdf when I get some cash)]<br/><br/>If you're a player it tells you right there in your game book, right at the start what your goal is. It's a goal-oriented game with a win condition. So...uh?

He was in danger of being murdered by undead scabs but then it turned out he was actually a ghost too.  He only made it through three rooms and none of his card-suits matched, so it looked like he would have probably been murdered real good if he hadn't become a ghost.  We kinda RPG'd it up, taking real advantage of the narration and question parts of the core loops.<br/><br/>The main difficulty I had was paying attention to all the core "moves" and remembering to turn to a page or tell John to turn to a page when one of them happened.  There aren't more core moves than in Apocalypse World, but we played the game cold and it was a lot to keep in one's head on first read-through.  We almost sailed right past the "if you do something that might catch the ghosts' attention" move.  I think it still works if you accidentally miss a move, because you'll eventually hit some other move, and it would get easier to keep an eye out for the moves in additional play.<br/><br/>Overall, it was pretty fun and relatively short.  There were a few cheekily clever things that I chuckled at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347162/#Comment_347162" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-28T10:14:31+00:00" title="October 28, 2011 10:14AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After seeing this thread, I purchased the pdf of this game.
