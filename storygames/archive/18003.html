Then, as it so often does, 80's music showed up and set me right.  The basic idea of becoming an Asura is contained in a verse from 'New York Minute' by Don Henley (emphasis mine):<br/><br/><i><br/>"He had a home <br/>The love of a girl <br/>But men get lost sometimes <br/>As years unfurl <br/>One day he crossed some line <br/>And <b>he was too much in this world</b> <br/>But I guess it doesn't matter anymore"</i><br/><br/>Submitted for those others who might need to understand the switch over to Asura...<br/><br/>By the way, Andy, this game is gonna rock on toast.  When will it be available for non-Kickstarters?  I have some friends I have been rattling the katana at that are looking to pick it up as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406707/#Comment_406707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T07:31:22+00:00" title="February 20, 2013  7:31AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mereb the Wizard: D...

Another great one is Fist of the North Star, for maniacs like me who remember the character of "Souther"; the man who loved his master so much that, upon his death, turned the area into a ruthless totalitarian society, sealing away his human emotions, in order to enslave the people to force them to build a giant pyramid-thing dedicated to his master. <br/><br/>Like most characters in this style, he too has a "gets 'killed', but right before he dies in his enemy's arms he recovers his humanity, gives a little spiel about how he was wrong, then explodes*"<br/>* In the case of Fist of the North Star, this can be "double-explodes"<br/><br/>Thanks! Re availability, I'll be creating a pre-order portal and finishing it up this weekend for the people who haven't participated in the Kickstarter*. Thanks to Nathan Paoletta's recommendation, I have a webstore that I'm currently filling out and prepping to go live.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* A couple notes:<br/>-- The kickstarter folks will get their books before pre-order or order folks.<br/>-- I'll be opening up the site to allow KS backers to "increase their order" if they wanted.<br/>-- While I'll have plenty of extra dice, I'll have to wait a few months until all KS backers are fulfilled to see exactly how many I have left to sell. So unfortunately I won't be able to do a book-dice combo for pre-orders. Though I haven't ordered tenugui (hand-cloths) yet, so I might add those.<br/>-- The kickstarter shipping rates I set were insanely cheap; in fact I'm quite in the red on international orders; I basically determined to subsidize $25 of each intl order, but then shipping internationally just jacked up another $20, meaning that I'm now subsidizing $45 of each intl order. Long story short, the prices for domestic shipping will rise a few bucks, and the prices for intl shipping will be pretty high (probably close to $50 per copy; $60 for two sets etc).<br/>-- Soon I'll have the PDF-only version (full art, text only PDFs together in a set) available from DriveThruRPG, IndiePressRevolution etc. Currently setting up shop there. ETA: 2 weeks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406772/#Comment_406772" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T18:56:02+00:00" title="February 20, 2013  6:56PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the info, I will pass it along - and likely add to my KS order as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
