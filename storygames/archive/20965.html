The game failed us.</b><br/><br/>We gave it our best shot, but it didn't produce what it was supposed to produce.<br/><br/>Solution: The game should be fixed. Alternately, it's just a bad match for that group's preferences. <br/><br/>(These are cousins! Identical cousins, in fact, if you're deadset on playing again...)<br/><br/><b>2. We didn't quite play the game right. <br/></b><br/>We gave it a good try, but, ultimately, missed some point of the rules, or perhaps the spirit of the game, and we ended up falling astray. It wasn't satisfying.<br/><br/>Solution: Adjust your approach to playing to better match the game's intent. Find a technique you were misapplying, or implement a new play habit or play culture. ("Oh, I'm not supposed to keep secrets from the other players in this game/I'm not supposed to try to win/You have to keep the stakes really small?")<br/><br/>(When the Forge talked about Creative Agenda clash, it was often all about this.)<br/><br/><b>3. We failed the game.</b><br/><br/>We followed the procedures, and understood the game, but it just... wasn't a good night. Someone was tired, someone was distracted, or maybe we're all new to this. We tried our best, but we didn't quite manage to play well enough for our own satisfaction.<br/><br/>The point is that the game operated as intended: it was the group which didn't "step up" and bring the awesome, in spite of functional rules and procedures. ("D&amp;D is cool, man, but you always play the drunk dwarf, and all the DM ever throws at us is kobolds. Bo-ring!")<br/><br/>Solution: Try it again on another night, or work on developing your gamer skills. Break out of bad habits, shake things up.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The question:<br/><br/>You brilliant, experienced masses on Story Games! Do you have any awesome tips or rules of thumb which help you distinguish one case from another?<br/><br/>How do you know if a game is no good... or that it was just your imagination flagging?<br/><br/>How do you know what feedback to give a designer? How to make the next session rock, or whether to discard the game and move on to another?<br/><br/>Share your wisdom!

We have had okay sessions and awesome sessions. For me, it's much easier to see if a role-playing game has a rules issues then if a collaborative storytelling game has a rules issue...maybe that's because I have played role-playing games longer, or maybe it is because I haven't ran into a 'bad' storytelling game yet.  I think you can tell a game is 'bad' it has a very obvious issue; such as, the dice always  creating the same issue, which causes gameplay issues, every time you roll them...things like that... I think coming to a place like Story Games and posting about and drilling down also helps to determine what happened.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460079/#Comment_460079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-09T06:28:03+00:00" title="February  9, 2017  6:28AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I KNOW this is stating the obvious but let's just put it on the table:<br/><br/>I mostly referee in games with a traditional referee role.

To an outside observer, though, it is often crystal clear. Often when I talk to someone who has had a sub-optimal experience with a game I designed, I can very handily put it into one of these boxes, for example. <br/><br/>So I guess my advice would be to talk about it with someone who knows and has success with the game, ideally in person.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tsawac" title="tsawac"><img alt="tsawac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tsawac">tsawac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460141/#Comment_460141" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T19:42:29+00:00" title="February 11, 2017  7:42PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's an important element missing from the list, which is: none of the above.<br/><br/>Storygames are really complicated systems! I mean, they don't necessarily look like it from the rules, but, like, you're trying to tell a story extemporaneously, getting it right the first time, with only minor, on-the-fly editing. A storygame narrative is a first draft, and it'd be completely unrealistic for a writer, say, to expect all (or even <i>most</i>) of their first drafts to be great. Most creative projects, even by highly skilled people, die in the early stages - and a lot of the time it's not because of anything the author did wrong, it's just Some Things Don't Work. It routinely amazes me that storygames succeed so <i>often</i>.<br/><br/>Sometimes a session goes badly and it's not the game's fault, it's not the group's fault, it's not a systematic problem that needs to be fixed; you just got unlucky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460142/#Comment_460142" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T20:02:01+00:00" title="February 11, 2017  8:02PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            tsawac,<br/><br/>I don't disagree with your premise - certainly, creative endeavours are often hit-or-miss affairs. But how is this meaningfully different from "we failed"? If I'm shooting baskets, I know I'll miss some of the time, and that's just how it goes. But it's still something I tried to do and failed; I initiated the action and didn't carry it out as I intended. Certainly it's not someone else's fault - the best I can do is to try to improve my percentage of "hits" (if that is, indeed, something I'm interested in).<br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>That's good advice!

Probably that doesn't cover most failed games, but I still think it's a real thing that happens.<br/><br/>The thing about highly complex, unpredictable systems is that everybody can do a perfectly good job, and the system as a whole can still fail sometimes. Something like shooting baskets - well, that's a relatively simple activity. It's just you and the constants of physics, and since physics doesn't mess around, if things fail then it's on you. Fiction is a lot messier.<br/><br/>And I think it matters in terms of what you do about it! In the 'we failed the game' answer, it's actionable information for how to play better in future. If you were too tired to be creative - get more sleep next time. If it's down to inexperience - get more practice. If an interpersonal issue interfered with play - sort that out before you game. But sometimes, occasionally, a game fails and <i>there isn't any lesson to draw from it</i>, and overdiagnosing one won't help you play better in future.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460148/#Comment_460148" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T22:37:12+00:00" title="February 11, 2017 10:37PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!

If they don't like it's smell, they can not play and all goes well.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that there aren't games that don't live up to the expectations they present. That certainly can happen. But as gamers gain experience with different games they can usually detect a problematic game before committing to play.<br/><br/>I think options <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> of the OP's list are the most common, and in the games I've run or played in, close to equally common. I often see players trying to bend a game's purpose or intent to something other than it's design is meant to support. This isn't often from ignorance, but rather from a desire to change the play experience for their own purposes. Distraction and energy issues I see a lot too for all the obvious reasons of work, timing, food, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bricoleur" title="Bricoleur"><img alt="Bricoleur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/102/nF1YBT6EAKPBY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bricoleur">Bricoleur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460213/#Comment_460213" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-14T05:50:27+00:00" title="February 14, 2017  5:50AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to propose a fourth category: "One or more of us failed the others."<br/><br/>I recently had a horrible experience with an open-invite pick-up game at a game store, and it was entirely the GM's fault. The system and setting seemed interesting, I liked the other players, and we did our best to work with what we were given. The GM didn't know the system, didn't know how to ad-lib, and wasn't willing to let us move forward around the rules. Anything we tried to do was met with "I don't care, whatever," or the GM shutting the game down for five minutes while he flipped through the game on his iPad looking for answers, or the GM complaining because our choice made it harder for him to kill off our characters. He didn't listen to a lot of what we said, so it was hard to establish any kind of basic reality to the game \u2014\xa0for instance, we'd say we were trying to do A, and he'd start describing what we saw/experienced if we did B. <br/><br/>You could say this falls under "we failed the game," but there were five of us at that table, and only one of us was failing the game, and creating an unpleasant experience in the process. And teaming us with him as failing the game seems unfair to the situation. I've been in other situations where one or two players became the primary problem, and the reason the game didn't work. In those cases, it isn't as simple as "our" actions vs. the game.<br/><br/>You asked about zeroing in on why a particular game experience is bad. Here's one idea: Try to honestly finish the question "I would play this game again if ________________." In the cases you cite above, you might end up with "\u2026if we fixed the combat system," or "\u2026if we found a way to give the story an ending," or "\u2026if everyone was in a better mood." Or maybe you answer is "\u2026if hell froze over, and even then, only reluctantly."<br/><br/>In my case, I would play that game again\u2026 if someone else was running it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
