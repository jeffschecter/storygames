In response, the military or secret government project\u2014like in The Mist, open a rift and the Elder Things come through battling the Evil Gods. The world is nearly destroyed. Supernatural disasters uproot/alter land masses and oceans.<br/><br/>A small segment of humanity survives. They flew in to a high valley west of an impassable mountain range. Think James Hilton\u2019s Lost Horizon. This is a pristine and wild place. The world as they know it is gone. Perhaps far to the west, there may be remnants of the destruction\u2014but is unreachable for now. <br/><br/>So you\u2019ve got a modern population of roughly 15K that have managed to survive\u2014nearly equally divided between women and men (25% under 10, 50% aged 10-50, 25% over 50). The survivors escaped with their lives and what personal/survival items they could quickly grab. Aircraft would have some cargo\u2014MREs, small arms, medicines. Every computer, tablet, and phone is unusable. Only older aircraft\u2014those without sophisticated electronics were able to fly in. Some people could use these as shelters\u2014at least at the beginning.<br/><br/>No major pandemics burn through the population. They live a very fertile area, mild climate, and plenty of water. Wildlife is plentiful and there are no supernatural predators roaming around. There is a range of unpassable Himalayan-sized mountains surrounding the survivors on three sides (North, East, and South), habitable lands stretch westward.<br/><br/>The warring gods and monsters seem to have killed themselves off. The rebuilding begins. The setting will take place sometime after this, but I need to get the origin set up.<br/><br/>So I\u2019d love to get some help filling in some details. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470050/#Comment_470050" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-17T22:25:17+00:00" title="February 17, 2018 10:25PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll ask some questions, in case the inspire (for me, anyway, I'd be shooting in the dark if I made suggestions without knowing the answers):<br/><br/>What makes this a "fantasy setting"?<br/><br/>Do you mean "fantasy" in terms of "not like the real world", or in the sense of the "fantasy genre", with all that entails?<br/><br/>Are there elements of magical realism, post-apocalyptic fiction, or both?<br/><br/>For instance, how would you feel about finding a highway nearby, full of abandoned cars? Does that fit the game, or not?<br/><br/>Do you see any themes, metaphors, or questions as being central to this setting?<br/><br/>How do you intend to use this setting? Is it for powerful, character-driven play which seeks to question what we value in humanity? Is it for an old-school hexcrawl adventure game where we get to "play ourselves"? Something else altogether?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470052/#Comment_470052" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-17T22:41:12+00:00" title="February 17, 2018 10:41PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Thanks for the quick response. The setting will take place much further down the line than the setup. It\u2019s a mix of Darkest Dungeons, Into the Odd, Red Country, and Expedition to Barrier Peaks. Most of the action takes place far on western frontier\u2014a gold rush of sorts for monsters and treasure that has opened up in the past thirty years. <br/><br/>Remnants of past civilization may exist, though this would be rare (somewhat similar to Shannara).<br/><br/>Setting is for old-school hex-crawls and dungeon-delving. I\u2019m just a stickler for having a solid background to it all.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470054/#Comment_470054" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-17T23:10:30+00:00" title="February 17, 2018 11:10PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

How did it occur? Not sure. <br/><br/>Lets assume that the Elder Things and the Evil Gods (more like Titans) warred and killed each other off. The survivors manage to gain a foothold and rebuild. There\u2019s some similarities to England and the Black Plague, where you have plenty of available resources, land, and an extreme labor shortage. I\u2019m not sure how long it would take to get to a million people.  At that point an event occurs. <br/><br/>A comet falls far to west. Something changes. Monsters and abominations stir again, the dead become restless. It is said that children born on that were \u2018tainted\u2019 with magic. Their descendants\u2014anyone with that blood\u2014has the capability to use magic (doesn\u2019t matter how pure the line is). <br/><br/>There\u2019s some inspiration from Lovecraft\u2019s The Colour Out of Space, especially the ending.  Where a meteorite crashes to earth and reeks havoc on a local area. Eventually the "colour" begins pouring out, spreading over everything nearby. Horror blights the land and then shoots toward the sky. <br/><br/>For the setting, the farther west you are, the greater the impact. The cosmopolitan cities in the east are far less impacted than those on the western borderlands. <br/><br/>But still unsure on the timeline. Certainly could use some suggestions on that and cleaning up the story.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470066/#Comment_470066" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-18T09:55:41+00:00" title="February 18, 2018  9:55AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How much is the past known to the players (i.e. have they read your thread opener post), and how much do you want it to matter to gameplay?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470070/#Comment_470070" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-18T21:25:23+00:00" title="February 18, 2018  9:25PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> I want it to be in the background, but doesn't have to be overly detailed.

At some point, they\u2019d definitely explore. There were attempts to cross the mountain range (these proved futile\u2014beyond the range is a vast ocean). Westward the lands within a 100 miles are very suitable for habitation. Beyond that the lands are hilly and heavily forested with poor soil. So expansion is limited for an extended period of time.<br/><br/>Some monsters would speak\u2014but they would not have a shared language from humankind. The survivors came from all parts of the world, a simplistic common language was created. So many things have been reduced to a single word. Salt is the name for the ocean, Rime for a cold, mountainous region to the northeast and so on.<br/><br/>The comet rekindled (limited) life in both the Evil Gods and the Elder Things, magic is a side-effect. I would say a segment of the population would be suspicious of those with the \u2018gift\u2019. Perhaps some left to establish colonies in the west, where they could be free/isolated from this.   <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470113/#Comment_470113" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-20T17:42:14+00:00" title="February 20, 2018  5:42PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's an intriguing premise.  What I think you need sooner than later, rather than fleshing out the background to much, is to determine a situation to go with the setting. <br/>Some intriguing elements that could fit into that situation here are:<br/>--a small starting colony, which could have a strong Founder Effect -- maybe it's  got some strange or cool cultural or even biological traits based on who the survivors were and who the first generation of leaders were.<br/>--A starting base with a lot of resources, but not good preparation. It's not clear to me whether the refugees are going to scratch out a living from the ground or if they're going to rebuild their numbers and living standards relatively quickly.  If you are going for the second option, Steven Stirling's novels Island in the Sea of Time and Dies the Fire are both going to be inspirational. Not great novels, but they talk a lot about how to rebuild from a semi-random starting position. <br/>--Based on historical examples of colonies, I could imagine that the humans in the valley could expand pretty rapidly and quickly get into both prosperity and some serious population pressure, which helps drive emigration and exploration. <br/>--A funny geographic setup where you have a rich starting base and then expansion only possible in one direction.  That would allow the leaders of the initial settlement to have a lot of control over supply and travel to the frontier, and maybe extract a lot of resources from the colonists. Particularly if the settlement maintains a monopoly on good transportation (navigable rivers, the best road, a railroad?)  That's a perfect setup for an American revolution-type setup.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470119/#Comment_470119" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-20T20:55:51+00:00" title="February 20, 2018  8:55PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/DannyK">@DannyK</a> True, the starting situation needs to be established. <br/><br/>Brood, Cinder, Ember, Rook, and Sullen are five large towns east of the Cut. These are places where resources are marshaled and treasures/resources are shipped to the cosmopolitan cities in the east. The Cut is a mile-wide rift which opened after the Night of Comet. Think of it as an open wound. Five crossing points (Staples) also entry into the Gloom. The large towns are far enough away to mostly avoid trouble found in the Gloom. Boomtowns within the Gloom have popped up near dungeons and other sites which have recovered valuable artifacts.<br/><br/>I certainly want an American \u2018Gilded Age\u2019 type of environment, where robber barons and industry moguls have gained unprecedented wealth from the resources pulled out of the Gloom.

Works just a little bit better for my preferred semantics of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>(My Glorantha D&amp;D works like this: you hit "heroic" stage at 10 000 XP, at which point e.g. resurrection magic starts to work on you and Sleep stops working, and "runic" stage at 100 000 XP, for further Glorantha-related cosmological wackiness.)</p></div></blockquote>\nFinding the sweet spot will be key. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
