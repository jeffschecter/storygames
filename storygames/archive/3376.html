This is not a full actual play report so I'm posting it here rather than the actual play forum, not sure if that's the right thing to do or not, anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game went pretty well, we did chargen and proving the princes and princesses (I don't understand the insistance in the book that all PCs are princes). Then yesterday we did the first island, based upon the example in the book.<br/>\nI had them arrive at the island, where they soon discovered disharmony between the King's folk (newcomers) and the native islanders. There were two major conflicts, one to prevent the natives from capturing a PC's pet cat which was trying to fish the lake, which resulted in us discovering that Princess Strawberry's heirloom was infact a universal translator (in the form of a dragon amulet which if it had it's head pressed down would allow one to understand and be understood by others). This facilitated the second conflict as the PCs headed back to the village to try to mediate between the natives and villagers, only to have their authority denied by the new Lord of the village. The conflict was over who had authority over the village and the Princes/s' won (with the cat flipping a tray of fish leftovers all over the lord as he grovelled in the mud). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe conflict system is a little cumbersome for the children and I would prefer something that resolved quicker. The Lord ended up with 13d6 and several other dice, and with 3 PCs joining in that was a lot of dice. This led to perhaps more to and fro than was really necessary. This may become more elegant with practise, but at present it puts me off presenting conflicts a little. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy main dilemma with this game (and with Dogs) is when to say yes and when to roll dice. I find saying yes very easy and if I'm not careful I might end up with no conflicts at all I fear. <br/>\nPCs: we arrive back at town and see the lord telling him to talk to the natives<br/>\nGM: he says he'll do no such thing<br/>\nPCs: but we are heralds of the king<br/>\nGM:I don't care, I'm the lord here, not you<br/>\nPCs:Where's the old govener?<br/>\nGM: In jail<br/>\nPCs: we rescue him and persuade the people to recognise his authority<br/>\nGM: OK, but the people are afraid of the lord still<br/>\nPCs: then we throw him in jail<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't what happened but it could have if I just kept saying yes. I went for the conflict when they started to debate who was in charge. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone give advice as to when to say yes and when to roll dice? <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76377/#Comment_76377" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-18T07:59:01+00:00" title="June 18, 2007  7:59AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a really simple method to deal with when to say yes and when to have a struggle:<br/><br/>Write down 1 to 3 things your NPC cares about. Most NPCs have 1 thing. Mid-level NPCs have 2. The big important NPC has 3.<br/><br/>When those things are challenged, roll the dice. Otherwise, say yes.<br/><br/>In your example, the lord has his authority as something he cares about. If you challenge it, it's a struggle. Also, the jailer has keeping people in prison as something he cares about. When you try to break out the governor, there's a struggle. If you want to, say, talk to the governor, no problem: the jailer doesn't care that much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Fricker" title="Paul Fricker"><img alt="Paul Fricker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul%20Fricker">Paul Fricker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76569/#Comment_76569" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T05:02:42+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  5:02AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2007 5:05AM by Paul Fricker.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I like that - and straight from the horse's mouth too!
