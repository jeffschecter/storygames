But shifting the primary goal of the game from fun to work seems to me like it would damage the experience, resulting in artifacts that help you remember a game that might have been more enjoyable without the added burded of artifact creation.\n<blockquote>Can creation of an artifact<i><b>never</b></i>be a form of entertainment?</blockquote>\nCreating an artifact can be a form of entertainment. My kids do it all the time with construction paper and markers. But they're not playing an RPG at that point, they're creating art. As soon as I take the time out from gaming to shift gears into artifact creation I've stepped out of the game. It happens when I take notes, and I can only assume that it would happen even more if I were to be expected to take notes in a way that created something designed to last.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm just burned by all those so-called "games" my high school and college English teachers wanted to play. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88175/#Comment_88175" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T09:17:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2007  9:17AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The question for me is: what do you <em>do</em> with said artifact afterwards?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88192/#Comment_88192" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-15T10:54:13+00:00" title="August 15, 2007 10:54AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is what I get for posting late at night after I get off from work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>I play my games for fun. <b>The useful artifacts left behind are the shared memories and stories that can be recounted years later</b>.</blockquote>\nOk, that is what I was referring to when I made the original post. You are all right, 'artifact' in it common usage refers to an actual physical object, whereas in my fatigue induced haze I was simply thinking of the remembered experience created and shared by the participants.<br/><br/>That said, the idea of games that actually do produce <i>physical</i> artifacts as a byproduct of play fascinates me. The closest thing to this I've had was a (modded) Otherkind campaign that I participated in that was co-GM'ed in a round-robin fashion. All players were encouraged, as they were so moved, to write down or draw names and features on a piece of paper that sat in the center of the table. Before long, it developed into a map of the shared world we were creating by the process of moving through it in play.<br/><br/>While it became a integral part of the play experience I don't think it distracted from the primary focus which was the enjoyment derived from collaboratively crafting an interesting story around dynamic characters. In fact, I think the play experiences was the better for it, as players were, for example, able to use it as a foreshadowing tool of things, places and entities that would possibly feature in the story sometime in the future. The idea was totally cribbed from Jeff, Judd and Storn's <b>Elves Illustrated</b> campaign.<br/><br/>Has anyone else done anything similar to this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
