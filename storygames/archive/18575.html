To design a game, you need rules and rules sets, but to design a session, you need structures.<br/><br/>To make a good roleplaying session, you need a game that have the following:<br/>- <a href="#Comment_418752" rel="nofollow">Goals for the players</a>. Most of the times it's the same goals as the characters.<br/>- <a href="#Comment_417756" rel="nofollow">Some sort of tools of interaction</a>, normally in form of a character.<br/>- <a href="#Comment_417936" rel="nofollow">Each scene framed with a clear intention</a>. The intentions is what the scene should be about.<br/>- Uncertainty. Normally handled by dice.<br/>- Reintroducing previous story elements to create a story that has a substance.<br/><br/>...and some things that aren't handled in roleplaying games.<br/>- A framework to make a solid group, so everyone are on the same level of how the interaction within the group should be handled.<br/>- Structures to free everyone's imagination and make people build on each others ideas. If anyone says "I can't play this because I don't have that kind of imagination", it's the game's fault.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417707/#Comment_417707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T08:35:46+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  8:35AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2013 9:00AM by Rickard.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="#Comment_418752" rel="nofollow">Revised version</a><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">GoalsWhen playing a game, the first thing that you need to know is how to win the game. To play a session in a roleplaying game, the participants needs to have goals. The goals can be a common one or specific for each person, but what's really, and I mean <i>really</i> important is that these goals are known by everybody so that we can create events with the other persons' goals in mind. If one person have as a goal to not reveal that the character as an assassin, the others can create situations where that goal is put in danger. Goals can even be vague, like "To create a story together" or "To explore social constructions".<br/><br/>In roleplaying games, we often have characters, but the characters' goals doesn't have to be the same as the players. A goal for the player could be to destroy the world. The characters goals could instead be to survive the apocalypse.<br/><br/>The goals the characters can also be shared or individual. If they are travelling as a group, the group could have a goal and by striving for that goal, obstacles can be in the group's way. This is how traditional roleplaying games works. In collaborative storytelling games, the setup could instead have each character with it's own with individual goal. By making two or more of these goals collide, you reach an uncertain point in the story and things starts to happen.<br/><br/>Even game master controlled characters (or shared, if collaborative) can have goals, but these only works as obstacles for the player controlled characters. They will either stand in their way or be the reason why the characters have their goal. As an example, if one non-player controlled character's goal could be to destroy the world, the characters' could be to prevent that from happening.<br/><br/>Without goals, nothing will happen. Only the participants needs goals, but the characters in the story can have their own goals as well. All goals must be known by everybody to make an interesting game.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417711/#Comment_417711" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T09:49:33+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  9:49AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like this idea of open goals shared by all, but I find players don't like this style of play and prefer to let the GM or ref to create these goals.<br/>This a traditional style I think? <br/>Coaxing players into goals gives choice, the element of the unknown.

I know I'm on thin ice when I write that goals must be known by everyone. I can easily imagine games where no goals are known by everybody but where one player's goal is known by another player, or a game where the players don't know the NPC's goal but suffers the consequences. My own personal opinion is that using goals like that is kind of worthless because it doesn't give any substance to the game. In movies, the audience always knows the antagonist's goal but perhaps not the reason behind it. Knowing the goal builds anticipation. An unknown answer that needs to be revealed.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should write that the goals must be known so everybody can enjoy them?\n<blockquote>I would love to bring the whole table into what you describe above, but help me out here. How do you go about it.</blockquote>\nAre you asking how to convince the players to take up this kind of playing? Otherwise, all you need to do is to ask yourself the purpose of the goal(s) of the session. What do you want to achieve with the session? How can the given (player) goals help you achieve that?\n<blockquote>Coaxing players into goals gives choice, the element of the unknown. Is this what traditional players crave ?</blockquote>\nThis is slightly unrelated, but you need some kind of uncertainty in the session that creates an interest. Choices are one way of creating that. Rolling dice is another. Raising a question a third. This is what the fourth article is about, but I will probably not post it here.

Or have a goal in the line of "Explore what kind of awesome shared experience this might become."<br/><br/>Neither does it come natural to me to make goal driven character. They way I see people, and characters for that matter, is that we have lot of different needs, and motivations, and feelings and thoughts and stuff. We might formulate some of this things into goals, perhaps. But often when we live our life those goals seldom matter. When I have a cup of tea with my grandma, that isn't a goal driven situation. Well. Unless it very small goal, like "Having a bit of cake today." Because,,, Well,,, None in that situation has very little to do with the goal or dream I have in life. I\xe4m just having tea with grandma. This might be due to the values and emotional needs I have, my habits and a lot og th\xedngs. But, goal driven... Nah.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that you are wrong, not on a personal level. But if you not used to think of the world in the terms of goals, goals are not really a useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417723/#Comment_417723" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T13:34:35+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  1:34PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually we all think on goals once we're into one situation, though we usually won't be able to think of one before getting into it. It's part of our adaptative way of thinking as human beings. You don't use goals at all? Think again: Probably after a few minutes into any game you'll have a short term goal; in the worst case it would be "let's understand this game". After maybe 10 sessions in a sandbox campaign your character would have formed some sort of bond with PCs, an NPC, a pet, a place or an activity and go quite far to protect it.<br/><br/>So goals may not start being proactive, or appear right away, but anybody will eventually develope their own, even if it's a small one and/or doesn't require the character to do too much.<br/><br/>Now, goals are formed around something the players get to care about, so it's hard to have the players care about anything in the setting without experiencing it themselves first, nor invest straight up front into something of their own (unless they are into creative writing and feel good/safe about the GM and other players toying with their creations).<br/><br/>Players will go with usual conventions though, so if the GM states their families have been kidnapped, they will react in consequence, making "saving them" their priority goal. Most of times at least, depending of what character they are playing (don't expect a chaotic-evil running to save them)<br/><br/>Of course, blatantly imposing goals on the PCs feels like totally denying players their freedom of choice and/or giving zero value to their input; waiting for players to come up with everything only works if you've got creatively-extrovert players (a.k.a. GMs) and finding a middle ground, though usual, still takes some time, a few sessions at worst. That's why random tables exist.<br/><br/>So Paul, no need to put the pressure on the players. Make a list of simple goals related to your setting, have players roll the dice on that list and see what they get. If you want to keep PCs in the same group, make goals interlock (like, to <i>kill this demon</i> you will need to<i> help the party Elf go through the mountains</i> and <i>convince a Druid to give you certain scroll</i>, etc) and if you want to have fun seeing at each other throats, make those goals opposite or exclusive and give them resources to throw at each other. (I tried this last one some time ago and it made us impro an entire Game of Thrones-like session, it was awesome)<br/><br/>Also, a nice game to try this out is <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lamemage/kingdom" rel="nofollow">Kingdom</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417724/#Comment_417724" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T13:43:06+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  1:43PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, WarriorMonk!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417756/#Comment_417756" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T05:24:00+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  5:24AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2013 5:24AM by Rickard.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h5>Tools of interaction</h5>I can say "character" and you will instantly, as a roleplayer, understand what I mean. It's so typical to use a character as a tool of interaction for the story. It's so typical that people don't even realize that they are adding characters without thinking of it. What else can we use to interact with each other during a session?<br/><br/>We could follow a place by together playing out events that occur on that place from the ice age up to present days. What happened during all those centuries and how did that change the landscape? We could also play out a war and instead of following characters, we follow different countries.<br/><br/>But this is not what I mean with tools of interaction. What I described above is just different kinds of story elements that we together follow during a roleplaying session. How can we together describe the environment? That's a tool of interaction. How can we decide on a theme for this session? How can we build on each others' ideas? How can we insert plot twists? How can we create a dramatic curve? How can we use each others' imagination to say what we want? How can we understand each other's intentions non-verbally? You can ask all kinds of questions about how we should interact, based on where you want the session to go.<br/><br/>To think in this way is important if you want to design a session. How are we, as a group, going to interact with each other to create a story? It is as simple as that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417763/#Comment_417763" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T08:47:43+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  8:47AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for non-verbal interaction, there was a scenario at this years Fastaval where not only were you not allowed to speak, you were only allowed to use body language.

This process has to be something that doesn't allow one player to negate other player's input <i>all the time</i> and rewards building over each other's ideas; I've got a comic publishing company and our brainstroming sessions for argument ideas always work faster and better that way, and get incredibly fun btw; on a good day everyone gets creatively charged with this kind of interaction and ideas snowball into an awesome avalanche.<br/><br/>I'd also like to try Tenra Bansho's 3 act structure, though from APs it seems that when you add the zero act for all players and character creation time, it usually takes more than a single session to play... one full session. It's not the only game that uses the separate acts structure, what experience have you had with any of these?<br/><br/>Adding random setting-breaking twists in the middle of the session <i>a la</i> Fiasco also seems to improve the experience too, though it may work with specific genres/games/groups only. In Fiasco's case it works because it's a mandatory process in the game that produces the whole "fiasco" feeling of the story. There are a lot of other ways to make twists in a story, though there aren't many games with procedures for all or at least a wide enough range of options and usually this require an experienced GM/players to be pulled off.<br/><br/>About scene framing I was thinking of something around the lines of Donjon but handled a bit differently: E.G. roll for perception, on a good roll you get to add specific details to your advantage, on a bad one the GM gets to add details against you. So instead of having the GM prepare all details beforehand and telling you "no, you don't see anything" on a bad roll, you have something interesting happening either way. You can base a whole system on this if you think it well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417780/#Comment_417780" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T17:44:27+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  5:44PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rickard, I'm guessing that quibbling and disagreement is cool for this thread; if not, just let me know.

The rule system leaves out how to handle interaction between the group, and it's something roleplayers need to learn. We on this forum have forgotten that we actually had to learn this and so game designers keep on leaving this out. <b>Apocalypse World</b> (that I haven't read, only read about and watched) is on a good way with how moves work - where player moves and MC moves creates a conversation - but it's not close enough, and the design solutions are still left in traditional gaming 'n' experience.

That's closer to your example. I see what you mean, but the thing is that we are taught to block our imagination. It's part of growing up and being an adult, where you adapt to how the social system works. You not only learn to block yourself, you even learn to block other people. Blocking the imagination and creativity is also learned in schools.<br/><br/>Imagination and free association have to be retaught to manage to play roleplaying games. I've been playing with beginners the last year and I had to develop exercises to free them from their blocked imagination. Once I taught them the tools to play a storytelling game, they were sucked into it. You can try this yourself. Ask someone to tell a story. If the answer is "Uhm, eeeh" or "About what?", then you need to help them in how to do free association. In how to unlock their creativity. This is soo important in roleplaying games. It can show you who is a good improviser and how's a bad one.<br/><br/>Roleplaying games that I know of doesn't do this ... at all. Nothing. No games.

A few thoughts:\n<blockquote><blockquote>WarriorMonk's point about short-term goals emerging in play is a good one.

Can you develop why "now it's time to define a Goal; now, play towards that Goal" is bad?</blockquote>\nI'm not saying it's bad for <i>every</i> game, I'm just saying it's not good for every game either.  Of my own two closest-to-done games, one does it and the other doesn't.<br/><br/>As for the downsides: I've played some games where players who were otherwise capable of getting into character became goal-button-pushers.  A concrete incentive and directed focus is very powerful, and it can be difficult to sustain other priorities (immersion, color, acting, whatever) in the face of that.<br/><br/>As a GM, I've had consistent success on the Goal front by simply providing inspiration and opportunity for the players, and whenever they settle on a fictional Goal (beginning, middle or end of a scene or session) is cool.  If I sense aimlessness, I ask, "What are you going for here?" and that's pretty much all I need.  As far as meta-level Goals, "have fun together by way of this fictional endeavor" has often been sufficient.  I'm not saying this is the way you should do it, just that it's an option on the menu.\n<blockquote>I didn't say that the intentions couldn't be vague. Just that they should be clear (everybody should know them).</blockquote>I agree that having everyone on the same page is a good thing.  If "see what's up" is a solid enough intention for you, then cool.\n<blockquote><blockquote>To me, all the above points really boil down to is, "don't play a random and pointless series of disconnected fragments", which is something most humans can handle once you get them on board with "we're making up a narrative together".</blockquote>\nThat's a good insight. I don't think it's something that comes natural though.</blockquote>\nPerhaps the hard part is eliciting true buy-in to "we're making up a narrative together"?  Once you <i>really</i> have that, the rest is pretty natural in my experience.  The part that doesn't come naturally to many people is embracing "making up" (rather than, e.g., rolling for) and "narrative" (rather than, e.g., isolated jokes) and "together" (rather than, e.g., I move my pawn and imagine what it means without needing to share).  Dice and jokes and pawn movement is socially easy.  Making up a narrative together takes some social bravery.  But once a group achieves that, I kind of expect that they <i>can</i> just talk through everything if they want to.\n<blockquote>Look at comedians and how their thinking patterns travels towards reintroducing previous elements to make jokes. I'm watching QI at the moment and it's full if humorous reintroductions. Whose Line Is It Anyways is another example, closer to our hobby.</blockquote>I love WLIIA!  If you're up for (and capable of) their comedically-timed reincorporation, great.  If not, I think the mundane level of "I remember what's been going on and will continue it" can suffice.\n<blockquote>The rule system leaves out how to handle interaction between the group, and it's something roleplayers need to learn . . .

I liked your ideas, especially the idea where you had different goals in different stages of the session.<br/><br/>It's typical that character goals and player goals are the same. A group that are about to do a heist can be both. An individual character goal could be to betray the group. A player goal for the others could also be to frame scenes to expose the character's goal and put that player into a tight spot.<br/><br/>When come to think of it, goals can be communicated implicit or explicit. "Take turns on telling a story of about how you slain a dragon (explicit player goal). Take a token every time you challenge the other player's stories (implicit goal in combination with the following sentence). If you gain three tokens, you achieve your goal."<br/><br/>A game can have different kinds of goals. Perhaps different kinds of winning conditions? Perhaps a mixture of short and long term goals? Perhaps separated player and character goals? Perhaps the goals can change during the session?\n<blockquote>During this first part of play, do your best to make sure each following scene has a different mix of characters in it, while still following logically from what has happened before in earlier scenes."</blockquote>\nA thing that struck me here is: is this a goal or is this an instruction for how to frame a scene? Of course a goal can be both (and should even be both?), but the goal itself should create a strive for the player. So how can you rephrase the quote above to create that strive?  (You have a goal in the previous sentence - goal: create relations - and you wrote that it was just instructions, but I will ignore that for now.)<br/><br/>A tip is to think outside the box. You need things outside the scenes that makes the player want to frame them in a certain way. A goal alone is not worth anything without any context, so you need different things (participants, rules/structures, story elements, goals) to interact to make, in this case, a story emerge from the interaction. This is why it's so hard for me to write about how to give the players goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417815/#Comment_417815" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T12:01:17+00:00" title="July  5, 2013 12:01PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2013 12:08PM by komradebob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard, have you ever seen the game book Pantheon? <br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_6954.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_6954.html</a><br/>There's a review<br/><br/>It's a set of five competitive story making scenarios. Each of the scenarios tends to be pretty genre dependent ( different genres). Anyway, when the game is over, players score points based on what happened in the game.<br/>The  points are all decidedly genre related.<br/><br/>The trick is, no one knows exactly what will score them points until the game is finished.<br/><br/>Nifty idea, conceptually. Some of the point scoring in scenarios really does run counter to character goals, some in alignment with them.<br/><br/>I guess one could take that concept broadly, and open up those scoring situations to full knowledge of the players. It wouldn't be the same game, but I hope that gets the idea across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417820/#Comment_417820" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T14:43:55+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  2:43PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't use setting goals for a character or scene at first, since that isn't something intuitive to human nature.

I've been thinking about how to make roleplaying games more competitive while still creating a story, not unlike how you play <b>Carcassone</b> (the added tiles creates the story but you need to build it with the others - how the tiles fit are similar to how to add story elements). I should really hunt down this book. I really liked one thing about the review, part from how detailed it was: "The Third Playtest /.../ This game though turned into a disaster. /.../ Success is greatly dependent upon the good will of the group, and as importantly, a shared vision of the game and the genre being enacted.

Whenever you take a leap in either time or space during the story telling, a new scene is created. Each scene should bring something to the story, either by a <i>decision</i> made, a <i>revelation</i> about a element in the story, or an <i>escalation</i> of a conflict. Note that these three can be combined. A revelation may lead to a decision that is the upstart of a conflict (escalation).<br/><br/>Intentions of scenes can be seen as short term goals for the players and never the characters. They exist so everyone are on the same page in where a scene should go, but not how it ends. "Patricia enslaving Patrick in this scene" is not an intention. That's a statement of what will happen, and it's rather pointless to play out something that doesn't have an uncertainty. Ask instead "why?". That's a revelation, and possibly a decision. Ask how she feels about it. Ask what kind of consequence it will bring. That could bring both a revelation and an escalation of a conflict.<br/><br/>I talked earlier about goals - about telling the players how to end the game (winning condition) or what the game is about. "You're going to kill your master" or "You're going to convince a ronin to fight for your village" are two goals. The intentions of the scenes can be about something else. They can be about creating a relation with the ronin or making decisions so your loved ones aren't hurt by the master's command.<br/><br/>The intentions can stay the same or change during the session. In <b>This Is Pulp</b>, all scenes are framed with a danger and the intention is throughout the session to overcome each danger. In <b>InSpectres</b>, you go through four different phases, and each phase brings it's own intention. There is no right or wrong in how you  deliver intentions but it's important that you think of this when designing a session because it guides all the participants in how they should play your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418752/#Comment_418752" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-21T08:59:22+00:00" title="July 21, 2013  8:59AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2013 9:01AM by Rickard.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will revise my second post.\n<h5>Goals of the game</h5>When playing a game, you need to know what the ending condition is for two reasons. So the ending wont be a surprise and therefore anticlimactic. A game needs its build-up to the ending to make it exciting. The second reason is that the ending condition creates a strive for all the participants. They will know what the game is about and do whatever they can to travel towards that ending. These are the goals of the game.<br/><br/>The goal must be measured in some way. To have fun or to create something great is to loose to measure, where creating strategies or building a story is easier to measure. The story can be good or bad but at least it's built. Goals can be handled in several ways but what's important to notice is that these are goals for the <i>participants</i>.<br/><br/>The goals can be for the group or be individual. They can change during the course of the game. But what is common is that all goals must be known by everybody to create a homogeneous experience. One player can't aim for a horror session while another is planning a strategic plan without them knowing about each other's goals. This will tear the group's collaborative experience  apart. It may turn out as a successful session anyway, but the chances will decrease. If they know about the individual goals, they can adapt to each other to either hinder or help each other to reach their goals.<br/><br/>In roleplaying games we often have characters but these doesn't have to be the same goals as the participants. The goal of the game, and what the participants should strive for, could be to unleash the apocalypse while the goal of the characters can be to survive the end of the world (and the end of the game). What's important is that the character goal can be a secret and it can be "terminated", but a participant's goal should never ever be either a secret or terminated. If the character's goal to survive a maze to see it's children again and during the session the character is finding the children killed, the character's goal is terminated. If this is also the participant's goal, the game would end for that person. That's bad if none of the other's goals are achieved. If the goal was a secret, another participant could terminate the goal without knowing about it. That's also bad. The goal could change to find the children's murderers which allows the participant to continue playing, but what this example shows is the danger of melting the participant's and the character's goal together.<br/><br/>The goal of the game exist so everybody starts at the same level. To show what the game is about. It creates a strive, it contributes to a build-up, it should be known by everybody and it can change during the course of the game. The goal of the game is the first step in designing a session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418789/#Comment_418789" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T08:03:42+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  8:03AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard,<br/><br/>Is your "ending" the end of a session, or the end of a campaign/storyline/module/adventure. Is it, "this is when we know we all can go home?" or "this is when we start a new cycle of storytelling?" It sounds like you're talking about the latter, but the thread is about sessions. <br/><br/>Through the lens of my AD&amp;D games, circa 1985, we often played late into Friday night / Saturday morning. We'd start at 7 PM or so and we'd finish around 1-2 AM. It took 6-7 hours to get to a satisfying stopping place. Part of that was the 30-60 minutes of dithering before we started, or the 30-60 minutes in the middle when we stopped for pizza. In terms of story arc for a particular session, I presented the players with some kind of challenge or threat, and they responded, and then they got XP for it. The session was complete when they had faced the problem. Sometimes they won, sometimes they lost. Over many of these sessions, they'd earn enough XP to level up. Then the real cycle was complete. That's why they played. (It was totally incoherent in many ways.)<br/><br/>I feel like this discussion is retreading a lot of ground that was covered on the Forge, in terms of creative agenda (and incoherence) and social contract. That's fine! It's good to start fresh and think about things in new ways. The idea of session design is a cool, new approach. The "session" as a fundamental unit of time for games is obvious but largely ignored in a lot of design thinking.<br/><br/>I submit that there are smaller units of time that might be interesting here, and they accumulate into sessions: let's call them "beats" (or "scenes," if you prefer). There's been a lot of design effort here. I'd be curious to see what results from working toward session design from both directions--from the scenes, up, and from the full-story-arcs, down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418812/#Comment_418812" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T13:42:02+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  1:42PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can agree with most except with this:\n<blockquote>So the ending wont be a surprise and therefore anticlimactic. </blockquote>\nNow, it's not that I don't get what you mean, this is about a collaborative session going in disarray and ending in something that is a step away from total gonzo if not already on it. <br/><br/>I admit my previous comments were based on a trad-with-a-less-collaborational-creative-agenda perspective, so it's just a different design philosohpy (of course any design philosohpy could greatly benefit from your article, but there are some concepts here that won't apply to trad at all -which is totally ok)<br/><br/>But the thing I can't agree with is how easily this can be misinterpretated as a design for a game with no surprises -which isn't bad in itself-, but totally beats one of the main reasons I roleplay, which is<i> to find out what happens next.</i> I do think is a misinterpretation and not what you actually meant, and on that, only a possible one, though you may probably like to revise this phrase again.<br/><br/>Through your model it looks like say, we play StarWars within the setting in Episode 4 timeline. We know the rebels will attack the Deathstar, which will be destroyed by the end. We can play another side of this story to make it interesting and since we know how's it going to end, we make it happen as players while making our characters try to survive. Nice so far.<br/><br/>But I'd also like an (stable and reliable) way to play a sandbox on that same setting, where the attack on the Deathstar may or may not happen according to player's actions or GM's creative agenda, and yet get a session that goes in crescendo whether or not there's a massive battle on the end (because massive battles are not the only good way to end a campaign -I had one which finished in a trial)<br/><br/>I mean, Foreshadowing is an excellent technique, but isn't the only one. Player's goals are all right but character goals doesn't need to be there since the first scene, these can wait until something happens. Of course, for the 2nd scene every character will have a goal, since otherwise they will become dead weight extras.<br/><br/>I'm trying something for my Tenra Hack, which is including lists of Aspects related to the character background that work as preconceptions/prejudices for the PCs. For example, a Kijin may have the "I'm sick of being cannon-food" Aspect. Player can invoke it to oppose an officer with an stupid plan that involves him dying for nothing. As a GM I could compel it to make the player think of better/other options instead of charging to his death; but mainly this works as a device to guide player's interpretation of the character, as much as D&amp;D alignments. The thing is that these kind of Aspects are meant to have the player generate goals as soon as their characters are exposed to a certain kind of situation. <br/><br/>About player's derrailing the end of the session or the campaign, that's also something that depends on how the creative agenda is handled by game procedures and by the player's social contract. I believe the designer can (and should) include specific game procedures and explain techniques that help players handle this better. Determining how's the session gonna end from the start is but an option. There are other ways to accomplish this which can also be reliable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418824/#Comment_418824" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T15:05:29+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  3:05PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2013 8:43AM by Rickard.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edit] Damn, I realize after a couple of minutes after posting this that I was being really vague.

As to what I write is more about collaborative storytelling than trad, I don't really see any difference (and even boardgames can be included into this). Yes, trad is more steered by one person but it's still a conversation taking part. You got tools of interaction, goals, idea building within the group and much more working in a synergy. All I'm saying is to lift these forth to increase the chance of making a good session. To be aware of them and to show them so other people don't have to learn them by themselves. Look at the first post and see what roleplaying games usually leave out for others to find on their own (often by learning from mistakes).\n<blockquote>Player's goals are all right but character goals doesn't need to be there since the first scene, these can wait until something happens.</blockquote>\nThat is exactly what I'm saying. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Also, take into account what I wrote about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/post/quote/18575/Comment_417936" rel="nofollow">intentions of the scenes</a>.
