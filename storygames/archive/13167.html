Tensions between the progressive left and the conservative, catholic right had been brewing since the end of the 19th century. When we were occupied by Germany, a sizeable portion of the population joined the "home guard", and swore allegiance to Hitler. (Including high-ranking church members.) Much later the reason given for this was "to protect us from what happened afterwards". As if they were somehow capable of precognition. And implying it would have happened if they didn't.<br/>When the allies won, and our communist-backed resistance army won, the right-aligned population fled the country (many to Argentina, quelle surprise). Then, the allies (British) stopped the fleeing people and put them on trains back to the newly-formed Yugoslavia, under pretence they were going to safety. When they got here, they were shot in huge numbers. There are still thousands of corpses in the woods all over. The British apologised recently about that. Nobody's hands are clean.<br/><br/>In my part of the country it was a little easier. We were under Italian fascism, not nazis. We faced the eradication of our language and nation. We faced deportation, de-settlement, re-education, shootings, burnings of cultural buildings. It wasn't about left or right, it was about the people. The church helped our resistance. Of course, it was a mess after the war, too, including mass killings. Horrible, horrible situation.<br/><br/>Although the resistance army had been mostly politically agnostic, the communists then seized control through it. Cue over forty years of relatively benevolent totalitarianism (relative to actual, not-so-benevolent totalitarian regimes). These days the right-wingers still bitch about the "secret police" and the "continuum of the leftist rule" as if there is some vast communist conspiracy and as if those still exist, despite the fact that they broke over 30 years ago. My girlfriend's father is one of those people. He thinks that when he gets a ticket for his car it's because he's not "one of them". And there are scores of young people, more every day, that wear the symbol of the medieval Slovenian state, the black panther (fucking irony, really) on their t-shirts and moan about immigrants stealing jobs and gays ruining families and "the red menace". You're 15, you don't have a clue, get the fuck out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296987/#Comment_296987" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-15T08:13:03+00:00" title="October 15, 2010  8:13AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not a problem, Raffaele--thanks for the apology, and accept mine in return for being a BIT too sensitive to your joking.

Call me a big insensitive hippie, but I will forever associate Ole Miss and Oxford with road trips from Memphis to visit my ex-housemates, wondering if the bottle of next to William Faulkner's bed still contained whiskey, 'shrooming in the woods behind Rowan Oak, and hanging out at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5134645533" rel="nofollow">The Hoka</a>. Colonel Reb was just a silly mascot, more of a dirty old man than an icon of oppression. Taking the context into consideration, we are talking Mississippi. <br/><br/>[And yes, I see there might be some irony there.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
