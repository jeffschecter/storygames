                    I'm a slow reader, it's something I lament. it affects gaming a bit, in terms of my "reading the rules to being able to turn around and run a game" ratio. <br/><br/>Here's something that I was thinking of the other day:<br/><br/><b>Traditional Games: </b><br/><br/>Everyone has a basic understanding of the rules, but the GM/DM is expected to know all the rules, back and forth (and usually they do).  The other players can sort of get by with a limited knoweldge of the rules, but usually pick up on this or that over time, or get involved with the rules to maximize the effectiveness in play or whatnot (Iron Heroes, The Riddle of Steel, etc).<br/><br/><b>"Story Games"</b> (for lack of a better word)<br/><br/>Everyone HAS to know the rules. maybe at first, one (GM) or two people understand them, but in games like Polaris, Capes, Dogs, PTA, Sorcerer and the like, there's not much rules to begin with, but not knowing them after the first session or two, or actively not learning them, will absolutely dent your ability to get into the game.<br/><br/>Problem is that both of the above methods tends to cause a lot of "downtime" between Purchase and Play as the one person reads the game back and forth, and either rolls from there (Trad) or brings everyone else up to speed (Story).<br/><br/>What about making a game (the assumption here being that the game is going to be pretty lengthy in terms of rules, somewhere at or past Dogs in the Vineyard), that starts off with a distributed ruleset?  Like, it comes with modular pamphlets or whatever, and it's expected that say 2-4 people will accept the role of GM over one part of the rules: The GM for chargen, the GM for conflict, the GM for combat, the GM for the story setup/scenario (the "traditional GM Storyteller role") and the like?<br/><br/>It might take a bit of creative thinking to make the game in a way that can be split up like this (and surely there may be some crossover between roles... but it would also be interesting if there <i>wasn't</i>), and can function well if one of the players doesn't show up that night (but I figure by "session three" everyone will be pretty well up to speed anyway).<br/><br/>Is this even worth thinking about?  It started as an idea on how to basically go to a gamestore at 5:30PM and be able to play it as it was meant to be played at 7:00PM.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

<p>I sense a deadfall here, which is that compartmentalising the rules means that your ways to make them interact are limited (or obscure), and if your rules interact well, then no one will <em>actually</em> know what is going on until they've learnt the whole game anyway.</p>
<p>I suppose that you could design a game that compartmentalises to the point that different rules modules don't interface at all, but that sounds suspiciously like playing several unrelated games simultaneously to me.</p>

                            You know, Eric and I (heck Jason, Eric and I) have split the roles of the GM before.  We did it in DiTV as a matter of fact.  I think Eric was running the town.  I ran one initiation and Jason ran the other while Eric explained things to the players that were sitting out.  <br/>
<br/>
It worked really, really well.  The difference of course is that Eric, Jason and I are intimately familiar with DiTV.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is what Jason is going for in Drowning and Falling.  Or at least that's what it feels like to me.<br/>

                            Drowning and Falling is a terrible example of anything wholesome, but yes.  I thought it would be awesome to split up the responsibilities around the table.<br/><br/>And I'd suggest that spliting people off to handle initiations in Dogs is sub-optimal, if  very practical.  In a perfect would you really want everybody participating and getting to know the player and character during those, particularly the GM.  I'd do it again, though.                        </div>

                            Re-reading your comment, Shreyas, makes me think of a game in which the rules themselves are largely unknown - maybe detective fiction or some Kafka-esque world where learning the game is what the game is all about.  Every player is a stake-holder and has a piece of the puzzle and some authority for enforcing rules that only they are privy to.                        </div>

                            Re: Kafka Game<br/><br/>That would indeed be awesome -- but it would be a one-play game.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing; How to Host a Murder games are all consumable games, and they sell like gangbusters.<br/><br/>As for making a "regular" game that has distributed <em>knowledge</em> of the ruleset, I think that's very different from a game with distributed <em>responsibility</em> of the ruleset.  Divvying up responsibilities is easy stuff (although what happens when the combat GM has a character that gets into combat?).  Divvying up knowledge is pretty much only useful for that start-up from purchase to play -- and I'm skeptical of the real utility offered, and the resources you'd need to invest as a designer to make it actually work.                        </div>

                            Joshua, I totally agree that replayability is not hugely relevant to perceived value.  Maybe we need more games that provide a fantastic experience a single time - those How To Host a Murder games are not even much fun.  I guess Robin Laws <em>Pantheon</em> sort of tried this.                        </div>

                            You could have a game that's set up like Mao (the card game) where there are some secret pre-established rules picked out by the GM or by each of the players individually.  And then, as you play, you have to infer what the rules are by how the GM or other players enforce them.  And because you'd get a new batch of rules with each game, there would be high replay value.<br/>

                            Hell, people are making a go of bridging LARPS and Host a Murder, and doing so by selling (and running) one shot games. Parlor Larps, for example (<a href="http://www.shiftingforest.com/parlorlarps.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.shiftingforest.com/parlorlarps.html</a>), seems to be doing a decent job at it. <br/><br/>As for the 'division of responsiblity" issue, it may be workable, but the truth is that in most complexe systems having someone who has at least a high-level knowledge of all aspects of the system makes process managment massivly easier and smoother. However, it might be worth looking into corporate work-group strategies to figure out how to balance responsibility across such a group.                        </div>

                            I played an RPG-like boardgame recently, Bruce Glassco's <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=ah/prod/betrayalhouse" rel="nofollow"><b>Betrayal at House on the Hill</b></a>.  This uses distributed rules.  Everyone plays a character who goes into the haunted house.  After a bit of exploration, though, one of the characters turns out to be the traitor.  That player then gets a special booklet and goes off to read her special rules, while the other players get to plot their strategy.  <br/><br/>So I think you could have special rules for the opposition player.  Another player could be the setting-master, say.  Seems workable.                        </div>

Of course, the basics are also dead simple, so it works on that wonderful level that boardgames work on that we haven't gotten RPGs to work on yet -- the 5 minute setup<br/>
<br/>
-I'm working on it, Brand.  The revised Standoff! has a set up that takes only about five minutes.  It just takes dealing everyone 4 cards and an ammount of chips based on the number of players.<br/>

Peace,<br/>
