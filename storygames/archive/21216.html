It stands in contrast to story-focused affairs because it has an emphasis on granularity and task resolution while remaining abstract. Hit points, Armor Class, "an action" - it's a strange balance between detailed crunch and narrative.<br/><br/><b>The Setup</b><br/>Combat procedures begins with establishing <b>surprise</b>. Those who are surprised are unable to take any actions on the first round of combat. Procedures then move to <b>initiative</b>: who goes when.<br/><br/>Both of these are matters of determining fictional positioning (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21193/fictional-position-vs-difficulty-on-an-axis#latest" rel="nofollow">something that has been ever on my mind</a>). A strong fictional position: not surprised, high initiative. A weak fictional position: surprised, low initiative. This becomes even more finely sifted when one considers permutations of surprise and a 1-20 initiative roll. "Not surprised" is always the best proposition, but high initiative in a drawn-out fight is desirable. <br/><br/>A strong fictional position offers considerable advantages in risk mitigation and resource conservation. Acting twice before the enemy can act once can very well end a combat before it truly begins. On the other hand, those with weak fictional position are more likely to use up their precious hit points or be forced into expending resources (spells, per-rest abilities, magic items) to decisively end a battle.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that fictional positioning is also influenced by distance between opponents. Sadly, I do not know of a procedure in modern D&amp;D (5e) to determine initial distance when encountering others.<br/><br/><b>Swings and Misses</b><br/>In the typical combat round, characters will attack, cast spells, and perform other actions. Everything done in the combat round has an opportunity cost except for movement (in 5e): it costs an action. First, let's talk about the to-hit roll.<br/><br/>The attack roll in D&amp;D has always been simplistic at its core: roll to-hit vs. AC. In contrast to the typical storygame, the consequences of failure (in this instance) are lower. A missed attack roll is merely a missed opportunity to deplete a monster's hit points. Come the next turn, a character has another opportunity to attack. Interestingly, the stakes of multiple failures are cumulative. Cumulative misses (or related failures) narrow the window of a character's success. ("Success" being defined as "eliminating the enemy's resources while preserving his own.") Missed attack rolls grant more opportunities for the enemy to strike at a character's resource cache, whereas attack rolls that hit do the exact opposite.<br/><br/><b>Spells</b><br/>More punishing is the use of spells, cantrips excluded. Every spell cast is a semi-permanent resource expenditure, making them far more valuable than the standard attack roll, but this has the side effect of a higher cost for spell failure (when the enemy's saving throw succeeds). As most spells having a casting time of "an action," spell failure wastes an action and a spell slot. Compounding this is the potential for a spell slot to be useful outside of combat. Spending a spell now could very well result in greater hardship down the line, up to and including death. <br/><br/><b>Hit Points</b><br/>Death is the ultimate "stake" set in D&amp;D combat. Character death is the total failure state. Hit points are a barrier to this failure state. In one sense, hit points exist as a measure of a character's ability to defend against his enemy's intent - and thus his ability to reduce hit points is his measure of his ability to achieve his intent.<br/><br/><b>Armor Class</b><br/>I cannot believe I forgot about this iconic D&amp;D aspect. Armor Class is a brilliant piece of game technology that represents the ability for armor to deflect blows and protect the wearer from lethal harm. It's almost a shame that Gygax created this, as it would preclude any number of debates about the nature of hit points and the role of armor within the game. But nevermind what could have been. Armor Class sets the difficulty for task resolution (to-hit rolls) in D&amp;D. In an interesting twist, an escalating to-hit bonus causes Armor Class to become less relevant over time, transforming it from a first line of defense into a form of damage reduction. Over a period of time, Armor Class works out to less damage taken, but in the short term, it may not provide much protection.<br/><br/>Additional thoughts are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464897/#Comment_464897" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-19T19:36:08+00:00" title="July 19, 2017  7:36PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"Not surprised" is always the best proposition, but high initiative in a drawn-out fight is desirable. <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nLet's talk about this. <br/><br/>Sure, being the one to act first (or to get extra actions via "surprise") is very important.<br/><br/>Once we're into Round 2 of the fight, however, does initiative still matter?

Both decks get customized as you gain experience. Old School Hack has a deck of actions too, only different.

The rigorous procedures matter most in an OSR-style game where death is a mere surprise round away, but they matter less in a system that emphasizes a flowing narrative.

Have maps, know where PCs and monsters are on the maps, solve distance problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465123/#Comment_465123" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-28T16:39:42+00:00" title="July 28, 2017  4:39PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam is quite right, but that requires a determined position for the encounter on the map.

Or did they spot each other at a distance?<br/><br/>It might be nice to combine this somehow with the surprise mechanics, if you're using some.

But\u2014it is very informative which versions are missing which bits. For instance, OD&amp;D basically doesn't have initiative rules at all.<br/><br/>Which is part of why I think that Rafu's description of initiative as outside of fictional positioning is not really correct. Another reason is that some versions of D&amp;D give characters bonuses on their initiative roll based on stats or feats etc. I've specifically embraced it as a piece of fictional positioning by preferentially determining it by weapon reach, movement (flying or horseback), height, or formation before ever rolling the dice.<br/><br/>(In OD&amp;D the entire initiative system is \u201csuch things as speed, ferocity, and weaponry of the monster attacking are subsumed in the matrixes\u201d.)<br/><br/>Much the same I lean into the surprise roll\u2014the winner of surprise gets to choose the encounter distance, either by the players navigating the fictional space, or the referee-as-Dungeon-Master advocating for the monsters to the best of their ability. This kind of close examination of each moving part is one of my favourite parts of the tradition!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465128/#Comment_465128" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-29T02:15:30+00:00" title="July 29, 2017  2:15AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very fond of that approach, too, for what it's worth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465135/#Comment_465135" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-29T14:43:05+00:00" title="July 29, 2017  2:43PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have played other games where initiative is defined by who stated first their reaction when the GM asked for it, and either comparing the stats or rolling for initiative when discrepances arise.

It's not too big, perhaps 90' x 90' and either one side starts right at the border and the other at the center, or both start at 15' from the border max, so they are either 1 turn worth of movement away or less. It helps that the combat doesn't usually start right after we draw the place and the minis are positioned, this is just to signal the players a possible encounter is nearby. They get to decide their marching order or try some things before the initiative roll, which do influence tactical positioning like initial distance and who gets to see what and react first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465138/#Comment_465138" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-29T18:42:59+00:00" title="July 29, 2017  6:42PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>Remember Sandra/2097's threads about D&amp;D initiative?

It worked perfectly, and was much more natural than rolling initiative. No more, "I attack him!" "Roll initiative!" "Welp, guess he attacks me instead."<br/><br/>To avoid rolling initiative entirely, after you attacked an enemy, the initiative passed to that enemy, or an ally of their choice if they'd already acted that round. If you didn't attack or take any other aggressive action\u2014if you cast a healing spell or went into full defensive stance or whatever\u2014then you instead passed the initiative to one of your own allies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465202/#Comment_465202" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-31T20:26:59+00:00" title="July 31, 2017  8:26PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!
