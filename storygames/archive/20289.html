I need some AW-style powers for this game I'm working on.  There are two kinds of powers in my game (players get to pick one of each).  The game is a bit of a mutant-survival thing.<br/><br/>"Node" moves are intrinsic to the character, like "When you *concentrate on open flame* you can make it expand arc around at your will.  If you use that to Go Aggro or Act Under Fire, use those rules, but roll +Power instead.  Also, you are not immune to fire and you have to be able to see the fire to control it."<br/><br/>"Network" moves are about the character's influence on the group, i.e.<br/>"When you *rest in the wild together* (as a group), talk to the others about how to set up the camp.  If they follow your advice, then you cannot be surprised in camp, and all members of your group will wake up refreshed even after a short night's sleep (lower the countdown clock by 1 if before 10 o'clock).  Also, you take +1 forward, one-time use for you, for dealing with any encounters that happen while camped."<br/><br/>(The infirmary/workshop rules will be Network moves, but will depend on the participation of the group in order to work).<br/><br/>I've been away a while, so I don't know - is there a repository of moves I should be looking at?  Is there another Powered by the Apocalypse game that's covering some of this ground and has been fairly balanced?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447201/#Comment_447201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-24T00:44:38+00:00" title="July 24, 2015 12:44AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would instead do something like:<br/><br/>When you use your powers, roll with +power,<br/><br/>on 6- you went 'too big' and wrecked more than you intended, curse this X-gene<br/>On 7-10, pick two of:<br/><br/>* You fully handle the situation<br/>* Nobody yells for the Sentinels to come and arrest you<br/>* You're not exhausted from your use of the power<br/><br/>On 10+ you get all three and you're real cool bub<br/><br/>Under no circumstances should you be trying to design superpowers as individual moves.
