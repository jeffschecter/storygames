I started playing vampire the masquerade (oh the horror) as a teenager, completely entranced by the idea of starting as a human, and then desperately try not to turn into vampires, or live with the changes. That was the premise our GM gave us, which was far from how it played out.<br/><br/>Many years and better systems and games later, my thoughts have turned back to that premise. The problem being, i have not played in many systems that tries to do this.<br/><b>Can/Will any of you point me in the right direction?</b><br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>I am in that endeavour trying to find games that touch upon the following aspects:</b><br/><br/>1. the process of turning into something else<br/>2. dealing with the loss of humanity.<br/>3. your former self dueling with your new instincts, senses and powers<br/>4. a game good at building suspense and dread, tapping into the ears that the players want to explore?<br/>5. gives a near intoxicating ammount of power to the "turned", and tempts the turned players to use these.<br/>6, GMless games of "tag, your it".<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This is because i am trying to gain inspiration in creating rules, mechanics and procedures for a GMless "microgame", where everyone starts as humans, but not everyone end up as humans - maybe fae, maybe vampires, maybe something else.  (and both sides are still in play, so also a game without a real loss state.)<br/><br/>The games i know sort of touch aspects of this are - and alas, i have only read them, never played them<br/>Svart av kval, vit av lust - the idea of how the beast gives you "Power" to ignore the heirachy.<br/>Undying - vampiric infighting and loss of control.<br/>Annalise's idea of vulnerability being central to the game, and its phases to ensure a grueling slow dwindling of humans.<br/>the strings of monsterhearts could probably also be used by both sides.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>Is there any game that focuses on specifically "turning"?</b><br/>Probably not, because after a bit of analysis, it will invariable have elements of a trauma-game in its theme of violation of self and change of personality. I only found out after starting, but i am willing to tread into that wierd territory.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451300/#Comment_451300" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-12T16:17:32+00:00" title="February 12, 2016  4:17PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played or read it, but you might want to take a look at Wolfspell, by Epidiah Ravachol.

This is something the player doesn't want to happen. The mechanic is there, but the theme can be changed.<br/><br/>Something I always wanted to see in <b>Vampire</b> was not having ones (on d10s) create botches but have them loose control over the beast (and humanity). This means that superhuman scores would bring a higher chance of loosing to the beast (higher probability to roll ones) and is a way of telling the player that the more superhuman the character is, the less human it will become. I would also give high scores in skills supernatural descriptions, like flying, or moving at super speed, because these skills wont be used that often due to the fact that the vampire can loose control. That's why we don't see them being used all the times in movies or TV series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451331/#Comment_451331" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-14T17:34:50+00:00" title="February 14, 2016  5:34PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look at Polaris, but with the idea that the Mistaken role reflects the involuntary internal change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451359/#Comment_451359" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-15T15:15:46+00:00" title="February 15, 2016  3:15PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friend knows better than me all the deal with VtM and Requiem, but from what I heard from him and readed on old discussions here (I think <a href="/forums/profile/JDcorley">@JDcorley</a> started those?) the mechanics and techniques for what you wanted to play are there... except that 99% of the GMs don't actually read the full manual in depth and end up playing it like D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Yet part of the problem is that the manuals doesn't give you proper procedures to do that, leaving up to the GM to define those. Like, the mechanics around <i>Humanity</i> are supposedly designed to deal with the transformation from a human personality into a monster, but require a compromise from the player side to work and special attention from the GM to introduce situations where the character has to face moral choices and problems brought by his lack of control when feeding.<br/><br/>That part was actually easy to miss/avoid, by pumping up your character's self-control or when the GM pushed the politics or action scenes because "playing the angst was boring".<br/><br/>My friend also told me that in Requiem the transformation part works a bit different, with more and more vampire-like traits increasing in number as you lose humanity. At higher humanity levels, you can even walk in the sun, but if you want to access your disciplines or do any kind of vampire stuff you have to roll or lose humanity.<br/><br/>Still, the GM has to pay special attention to his part and play it more, instead of getting too distracted by the relationship between clans, the intervention of other supernatural creatures, human hunters, werevolves and such. The common human NPCs have to be better fleshed and more important for the PCs, instead of just walking sacks of vitae, so biting someone isn't something done lightly. The challenges need to be something that can be solved without using disciplines, but the temptation of using them still has to be there. That part alone requires a good talk with the GM and players to keep the theme focused on that.<br/><br/>But I still think that it isn't impossible to play the game like that, specially Vampire the Requiem, which is actually more focused at what you're searching for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer" title="TheRoleplayer"><img alt="TheRoleplayer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheRoleplayer">TheRoleplayer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451443/#Comment_451443" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-19T00:13:50+00:00" title="February 19, 2016 12:13AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be following this one with great interest.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451774/#Comment_451774" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-06T07:04:18+00:00" title="March  6, 2016  7:04AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben's absolutely right about Polaris, of course.<br/>You can also look at Sorcerer that way.<br/><br/>NightLife had a Humanity mechanic, but I don't think that game does what you want.<br/><br/>Have you looked at Cyberpunk and other games in that genre?
