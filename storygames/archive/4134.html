I mean, it kept the game flowing, no one worried about getting hungry and wanting to stop the game, no one suffered from post high-carb meal brain death. Really can't thank my wife often enough for figuring that out.</li><li>I really need to work on my organization while GMming. I'm a messy guy.</li><li>Chargen took longer than expected. Need to factor that in next time.</li><li>Speaking of chargen, 40% of the stuff that was in it didn't seem to important for some of the players. Mind you, it was a different 40% for one person, and a different 40% for another.</li><li>How does one accommodate the needs of what Robin D. Laws calls a "Tactician" in a game where the most planning I did was to figure out maybe 3 stock characters, a skeleton of a plot, and about 12 pages of mook sheets (basically forms that I could fill up quickly and make up up to dozens and dozens of faceless mooks at one time)? 'Cause I really don't want to work for my prep, and I don't want the guy to look so unhappy when I threw another curve ball at him. Never mind that he was 1 hour 15 minutes late. And it was fun to surround him with zombies. Who were ninjas.</li><li>Oh, yeah. I GMmed the game, on a dare from one of my players, while wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarong" rel="nofollow" title="link to Wikipedia article">sarong</a>. I don't know if that affected my GMming performance or not. It should be noted that, for almost 26 years of my life, I had no idea how to wear that darned thing, and it was only last week I figured it out, which was more or less like, "Hey! I'm a <em>man</em> now, I can figure this shit out without depending on other people!"</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George%20Shannon" title="George Shannon"><img alt="George Shannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George%20Shannon">George Shannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92646/#Comment_92646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T17:11:45+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  5:11PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really cool<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich parts of char gen did people not like?

Thanks!<br><br>I've seen a few different problems with tacticians at times. Because it's hard to give them a good reward other than "good thinking, here's some sweet bonuses", but then, you don't want things to go exactly according to plan (because that's not what the genre is about, IMHO?), but even still you don't want to just nerf the tactician and take away the smart stuff they came up with.<br><br>What I'd guess I'd do is work out a system with the tactician (with their consent). For example: good ideas get a bonus to rolls, and a successful roll means a successful plan. If a plan is going well the GM may still invoke a complication or new problem, but they basically get to take their previous success as a bonus to use later as an instant "Aha! I thought of this all along..." moment. So their goal won't be to be clever in order to prevent trouble later on, but to be clever to earn a bonus to use as a vital last-minute success.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92657/#Comment_92657" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T18:28:29+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  6:28PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2007 5:41AM by T-Boy.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: George Shannon</cite>This is really cool</blockquote>\nI'm really, really happy\u2009\u2014\u2009I mean, really, <em>really</em>, not just stoked or blown away\u2009\u2014\u2009that the game went to well.

She had a clear idea of what her character's <em>powers</em> would be, and what the personality of the character would be (she was quite enthusiastic about that, fleshing out her character's life story and possible plot points and how the character would earn her keep by being the owner of a small newsstand franchise, so I had to curb her enthusiasm a little) but even now she has trouble with coming up ideas of what her costume would look like.</li><li>Khalil (in LJ as khalilur) had pretty specific ideas of what he wanted for his costume: he wanted to dress like a ninja! But he wasn't too clear about his background, apart from the fact that he was from a well-connected, anti-superhero family, and his powers had something to do with the shadows; heck, he treated his power selections in a very old-school RPG kind of way (in other words, thinking of powers the way one is supposed to think of stunts). Must get him out of that habit.</li><li>J (in LJ as dulyoncourt) was pretty simple to deal with. She wanted to kick ass, and she wanted to do it in a gothy sailor fuku. That part was easy. Getting her to work on her motivation and background was easy. Getting her to act on her motivation and kick more ass was fun, and she got the lion's share of the HPs that morning.</li><li>C (in LJ as passive_rebel) was a bit hard. She has a <em>motorcycle</em> and a fricking <em>sword</em>, but she ended up being the "drugs gal" a lot. Plus, her meta-power, Super-Drugs wasn't too clear for me until much later. Will need to get her to work on being more Blade the Vampire Slayer and less druggie White Mage next time round.</li></ul>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: George Shannon</cite>I would bet Tacticians would have a tough time with T&amp;J.

I'm pretty happy with how easy it was to make shit up in the game. It's not something that I could do with d20; not on the fly. Being disorganized and going, "Eh, fuck it, just give the situation this, it'll be fine" went along surprisingly well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92658/#Comment_92658" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T18:43:19+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  6:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>For example: good ideas get a bonus to rolls, and a successful roll means a successful plan.

Usually, I ask them to use one of their Qualities or Powers in order for them to get what they want, and if they make it, they get it without a hitch. If it doesn't work, I tell them more or less the same thing, but I include a complication (the information was incomplete, the doohickey doesn't work, what they do just disables the primary system and only slows it down for a while, their entry is less than quiet and people notice).                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Liminaut" title="Liminaut"><img alt="Liminaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Liminaut">Liminaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92690/#Comment_92690" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T23:41:39+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 11:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tacticians in T&amp;J:  Look in the example combat in the rules.
