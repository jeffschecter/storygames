I'm just not comfortable about playing a game about inner city communities with the people I regularly game with.  If they were white, upper-middle class Engineering students who watched "The Wire", it would probably be a different story.  But I just don't trust the group to be aware enough of our own privilege to not create situations that will be embarrassing and awkward.  I had much the same response to Rookvale and it's approach to gender.  It's not a game I want to play with people who are so cisgendered that they've never heard the word "cisgender".<br/><br/>This isn't meant to be an attack on my various gamer friends, who are all wonderful people (even if some of them are pretty sheltered).  Nor is it necessarily a call for solutions:  I have plenty of other games I will enjoy playing with my friends, and i have ways of exploring similar themes without putting myself and my fellow players in a situation where possible blindness to our own privilege has the potential to create negative gaming experiences.  I ran an X-men game that used mutants as a metaphor to explore themes of minority identity, and it was a fun and successful game, but it also contained situations where I was glad for the metaphor because if such and such a scene had been about (for example) actual two-spirit people instead of my made-up mutant analog, I would have wanted to stop and play a different game instead.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431217/#Comment_431217" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T01:57:17+00:00" title="April 18, 2014  1:57AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can totally understand the reticence around playing these games with your friends, but I think that's precisely why those are the people you <i>should</i> be playing them with, if you really want to play them: just start by saying something like this:<br/><br/><i>"Look, this game covers some difficult subject matter that we aren't intimately familiar and I don't expect us all to get it right first time, so nobody is being judged here and if we make mistakes, we'll just learn from them and move on.

Games can provoke a surprising amount of empathy and offer a safe way to explore things outside one's experience, but that only works when everyone is 100% on board. If your friends approach gaming as escapist fantasy they will probably not be on board. One solution is to find other gamers who are.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431231/#Comment_431231" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T08:03:56+00:00" title="April 18, 2014  8:03AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2014 8:14AM by Graham.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, arscott, but that leads to only playing games with white, upper-middle class characters.<br/><br/>I understand where you're coming from.

It's the reason people shy away from playing <i>Steal Away Jordan</i>, a game about slaves: because they're afraid of getting it wrong. But they <i>should</i> be playing it and getting it wrong, because the alternative is not playing it.<br/><br/>Play it with them, really, even if you're afraid they'll get it wrong.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431232/#Comment_431232" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T08:29:04+00:00" title="April 18, 2014  8:29AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know, it comes to my mind that you could think of it as such: it's <i>okay</i> to fumble through these things with the intent of doing it right eventually, because you're not going to offend anyone.

And certainly the characters they've created don't always reflect the status quo: In my X-men game, some of the deepest characters were female characters played by male players.  In the game before that, the youngest character whose important relationships revolved around his biological and adopted children.<br/><br/>Jason, it more speaks to what you're talking about as gaming as an exploration of other experience vs. gaming as escapist fantasy.  I think with my X-men game, those goals weren't mutually exclusive--The game could be an exploration of identity and an escapist fantasy at the same time.  Ditto MonsterHearts.  The 'Hood, though, is just as far from their fictional interests as it is from their real lives--and I think therefor that the impulse for escapism will transform the game into something that's either awkward or uninteresting in terms of identity exploration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431248/#Comment_431248" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-18T12:35:36+00:00" title="April 18, 2014 12:35PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Rookvale is something you should try out: part of what's so invigorating about it is that just presents you with some genders, with very little explanation of what they are, and very little referent to this world.

Yes, each character ended up with a somewhat different identity and what those identities turned out as wasn't particularly defined by the game in advance, but I'm not sure it really creates discussion or exploration on the theme of gender if you're not looking for it to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
