I released an "almost done" version of the game at Dragonmeet 2007 as an ashcan, and the whole process was very enlightening and has made the finished version a much, much stronger game.  I will wax lyrical about the ashcan process for anyone who wants to hear it, but to me it proved invaluable.  I made an utter bollock-mountain of the process in some ways, but in the end the feedback I got helped a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are asking what Uml\xe4ut: Game of Metal is, then here is the skinny.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all started as a Contenders hack, but has mutated a lot over the design process.  There have been a few false starts, some design-which-seemed-good-at-the-time-but-turned-out-to-be-pants and a lot of input from a lot of people.  The finished version will have elements familiar to people who've played Contenders, but an overall far lighter tone and more of a focus on balance and competitive play.  It "feels" very different from Contenders, if that makes sense?  Each player controls their own metal band, and charts their rise (and sometimes, fall) of their career.  Conflict resolution is card based and there is no GM, with players setting scenes for their bands one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn designing Uml\xe4ut, the idea was to let the rules guide a player when it's not obvious what to have their band do next.  Nothing obvious in the story, but your band's Power trait is a bit low?  Sounds like you better buy a new amp and increase it!  No Cash?  Better run a Work Scene!  That kind of thing.  In play, this tends to lead to a very organic flow of story from the players, without any need for any preparation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been tested over and over and over, by me and by a bunch of other people.  I've run the game (as playtests and as the finished game) at conventions all over the UK, clubs and with about half the people I know (gamers and non-gamers).  Every time I've seen a rough corner I've tried to smooth it, and done whatever I could to polish this game to be the best I can make it.  I'm not perfect, I'm sure there things in the game which perhaps could be done better by someone smarter than me, but overall, I think this is a very solid, very playable game that's a blast to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nArtwork and layout are by Paul Bourne of Contested Ground fame, and cover by Jon Hodgson, who's excellent artwork graces many a book on the shelves of your local gaming shoppe.  And dammit this book looks great, even if I do say so myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI expect to have a PDF for sale before the end of the year and dead-tree early next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\n<br/>\nRich<br/>\n<br/>\n\\m/  &gt;_&lt;  \\m/                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242609/#Comment_242609" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T13:35:09+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  1:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well the title is about as awesome as you can get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242610/#Comment_242610" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T13:38:42+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  1:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2009 1:38PM by Rich Stokes.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Well the title is about as awesome as you can get.</blockquote>\nThanks for that!<br><br>It was originally going to be called "Uml\xe4ut: Contenders for the Throne of Steel", but at that time it was going to be a supplement for Contenders.
