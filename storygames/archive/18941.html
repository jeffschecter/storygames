If you happen to be at Indiecon (a major UK con) in November, come and see us at our stall there, and we'll happily bend your ear about our fab games. Better yet, why not play some of them?* Ah go on. Ah you will. You will, you will, you will you will you will. <br/><br/>Oh, and have a shufti at our blog, and chat to us about games and game design. Yep, we <i>love </i>talking about games and game design. And we do it <a href="http://ukrpdc.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>*Even better, why not treat yourself to the books, which will be available to buy at our stall <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>. For those of you not based in the UK, have no fear, you can buy our books too- most of us have seperate websites or blogs etc. where they can be obtained, but, if you're having difficulty obtaining them, post a comment on our blog, or contact me here and I'll try to put you in touch with the relevant designer <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Happy gaming y'all!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423381/#Comment_423381" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-25T21:17:32+00:00" title="October 25, 2013  9:17PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you mind putting a list of the publishers and products involved right here into the thread?

'S a matter of fact I've just PMd Eero and Rickard- as they jumped in early on- to ask precisely the question your post raises, i.e. would folks prefer a promo thread for each game, or a list of blurbs for all of them. So I guess I may as well ask here, which would y'all prefer? Although it risks being a bit wall-of-texty, my preference would be for a list of blurbs in this thread, which would have the advantage of presenting them all together, so folks don't have to hunt them down individually, and it would be in keeping with the Collective's ethos of everyone supporting each other and working as a team. So far I've had blurb back from Ash, John Keyworth and The Pompey Crew, and I'm sure the others won't be far behind- if they are, I'll poke 'em all with a stick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423559/#Comment_423559" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-31T09:57:44+00:00" title="October 31, 2013  9:57AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Either approach is fine, I guess I'd prefer individual threads for focus and clarity.

Here's the first tranche:<br/><br/><b>The Pompey Crew</b><br/><br/><i>Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne</i> is a GMless and prepless story game about guilt and absolution in medieval Britain. Most basically, it's about some people dragging a young woman to her execution in order to save the country. It's fairly serious and it's focused on exploring the backstories of the characters involved and how that effects the power dynamic of the group up until the critical moment at Lindisfarne. It's designed for focused single-shot games.<br/><br/><i>Marquis of Ferrara</i>  is a GMless and prepless story game about passion, politics and murder in Renaissance Italy. Most basically, it's about some powerful nobles fighting and politicking over a city after one of them killed off the previous Marquis. It's fairly melodramatic and focused on exploring the promises and lies people will tell to further their goals. It's designed for focused single-shot games.<br/><br/><b>Damwain Games</b><br/><br/><i>What You Wish For</i>  is a GMless structured freeform for exactly 3 people. In which you explore the hopes and memories of everyday people who have become dissatisfied and directionless. You reflect on their past, dream about their future and then make a decision about how they will positively move on with their life. It uses interpreting art cards as the main mechanic of play.<br/><br/><b>Kiwi Games</b><br/><br/><i>Intrepid!</i>  is a GM-less, prep-less, structured freeform game of fantasy adventure and world building for 3-5 players. You explore the stories and struggles of characters in a collaboratively created world. The setting and map grows in detail and scope as you play, taking what you do and reincorporating it. Suitable for both one-shot games and longer campaigns.<br/><br/><b>Paul Mitchener (dr_mitch)</b><br/><br/><i>Age of Arthur</i> - a game set in dark ages Britannia, two generations after the withdrawal of the Roman Empire. It is a time of fading magic and desperate heroism. A brave few battle for freedom, the old ways, and the memory of Rome against an ever growing invading power, when all is crumbling into barbarism.<br/><br/>In terms of modern fiction, Cornwell's Warlord Trilogy and some of Rosemary Sutcliff's books are inspirations, though with added doses of the fantastic, such as the Fae and some of the Welsh Legends.. Although inspired by Arthurian myths, the feel is dark ages rather than medieval.  Magic is present, though mostly low-key, and an option for player characters.<br/><br/>It's a self-contained game and the system is a variant of the popular Fate gaming engine, modified to best model the feel of the setting.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>More to come, and I'll work on adding images, which Eero suggested, but I may need some help with that.

One of the few games that brought me close to tears. This game should have conquered the world by now, but Ash doesn't do self-promotion well. It's lovely.<br/><br/>Intrepid used to be called Quest.

A lot of us will be there as individuals, and many of us are also part of Indiemeet which, as Piers says, will be operating a GoD as they did last year, but I don't think the Collective will be there as such. We've only started planning con appearances fairly recently, and have put a lot of this year's eggs in the Indiecon basket (Indiecon starts next Thursday). Dragonmeet is very close to Indiecon- only a month after in fact- plus it requires a significant amount of advance notice, so it looks like there won't be a UKRPDC <i>stall </i>there this year although, as I say, a good many of its members (including me) will be there under their own steam, so if you want to talk to us about our games while you're there, just ask around on the day and someone will probably go and find us or point us out. So, maybe see you there? <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a> Thanks for your kind words <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423585/#Comment_423585" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-31T18:42:04+00:00" title="October 31, 2013  6:42PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><i>Marquis of Ferrara</i>  is a GMless and prepless story game about passion, politics and murder in Renaissance Italy.

I believe game systems should boost and support that creativity. However, as art, without limits is mere anarchy, I believe in a clear structure. <br/><br/>Of course, "SqUK" is fully scaleable, but - basically - it's in the Stan Lee/1970's Marvel mould - with the Comics Code in place.<br/><br/>The game features the single best Superhero character creation system in print. The perfect blend of random elements and design drives the creation of some of the most inventive characters I have ever seen. Basically the players roll a few dice to get a starting point for their heroes but then have complete control over how they turn out. You can come to the table with no idea what you want to play and - a few minutes later - you've got an original living breathing Superhero that you've created that you want to play.<br/><br/>(It's bloody brilliant for creating Supervillains.)<br/><br/>A system of derived characteristics drives things forward. How you act in one game directly affects what happens in the next. If you're a true hero (ie. follow the Code) people look up to you. The more you solve crimes, the better a detective you'll become. <br/><br/>I originally wrote Golden Heroes over 30 years ago (it's in Wikipaedia). Squadron UK has grown out of 30 years of experience and criticism. Whilst the combat system is still fully detailed, for, example, it's now deliberately streamlined so that one combat doesn't occupy a full play session. You can play out the entire Avengers movie in a session or two.<br/><br/>I hope that's given you a flavour. I can really wax lyrical about my game, obviously, but hopefully that's enough to let,you know what it's all about.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley" title="Simonpaulburley"><img alt="Simonpaulburley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/525/nEVIULR78FJ45.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">Simonpaulburley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423592/#Comment_423592" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T00:55:41+00:00" title="November  1, 2013 12:55AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> Will the Collective be at Dragonmeet?

In ERA, you take the role of Legends - classic solo heroes (think 'Conan', 'Hercules' or 'Judge Dredd') - or legendary partnerships (think 'Fafhrd and Grey Mouser', 'Han Solo and Chewbacca' or 'Batman and Robin') - and battle against a variety of epic obstacles as you progress on your heroic quest. The game plays through a mutable series of scenes that mirror the Legends abilities and themes. <br/><br/>ERA is powered by setting packs - 'The Dragon Toothed Mountains' (a northern fantasy setting) is included in the base book and 'Caliphport' (an Arabian nights style setting) has just been released. Upcoming setting packs have been sponsored through Patreon and include 'Cthulhu's Company' (Sharpe vs Cthulhu), an as-yet-unnamed 'School of Witchcraft' setting and 'The Last Briton', with your hero facing off against invading Romans.<br/><br/>ERA is available on a Pay What You Want basis from rpgnow via Omnihedron Games<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423652/#Comment_423652" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T16:29:03+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  4:29PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Neil">@Neil</a>: Mmm, I like shorter games because I tend to take on roleplaying games more like boardgames nowadays, where it's a leisure game where you play only to spend time with friends.

Because she is a frail young girl and we are hardened tough men...right??<br/><br/>A clever Elousie will pick up on this and use it to her advantage.<br/><br/>Having said that it is just a theme and Witch only exists because of the hidden depths of Seid and Monsegur.
