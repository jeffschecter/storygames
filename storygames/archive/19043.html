You decide to concede.<br/>Can you ask for getting away safely, running away? (Will that trigger a chase Contest?)<br/>Can you ask for getting capture but not killed? What if these \u201cdi sma\u201d are super vicious?<br/>What if they turn you into slaves\u2026 what happens?<br/><br/>I guess it\u2019s more that I\u2019ve got some procedural murk, I think, namely: who decides? What is the protocol?<br/>Is it: conceder proposes (along with terms), the other can accept the concession or fight to the death?<br/>Or does the other have to accept?<br/>I mean, what if the PCs are fighting some NPC dork and the dork wants to concede in order to flee in their magical balloon.<br/>Can the PCs say no, we want to keep on fighting until we get a Taken Out result, because we want the dork behind bars?<br/><br/><br/>Oh, I was going to ask for compel examples, too\u2026 especially for compels that are not character aspects, but things like situational aspects or, weirder, <i>other people\u2019s</i> aspects.

The <i>Dresden</i> rules (<i>Your Story</i>, pg 206) say that <strong>the gaming group as a whole</strong> gets to say whether the proposed concession is reasonable or not. It says that the terms of the concession "have to represent a clear and decisive disadvantage" for the character conceding. It also gives some guidelines: The conceding character should have at least one moderate or worse consequence, or have some kind of significant difficulty created, or something that restricts them. Or some other outcome that seems equivalent to those. I think <a href="http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#succeed-at-a-cost" rel="nofollow">the discussion of <i>costs</i> in <i>Fate Core</i></a> (pg 190) might be a useful source of ideas. <br/><br/><i>Dresden</i> also suggests that the group discuss how lethal conflicts are going to be, and that in games where it's not assumed that any conflict can kill you, the GM should hint at players at the start of (or even before) the conflict when an antagonist is looking to kill. Concessions then become a mechanism for insuring that PCs only die when it's meaningful to the player. <br/><br/>There's nothing in there about what happens when a concession is refused. I think the assumption in current <i>Fate</i> is that if a character concedes, the opponent doesn't get to refuse it. Which isn't how things worked in <i>Spirit of the Century</i>; there concessions could be refused, but the character refusing loses a Fate point, and the character who offered the concession gains one.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425258/#Comment_425258" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T21:27:52+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  9:27PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like the idea of forcing people to accept concessions, particularly when it's an NPC who wants to concede. Because it seems like the GM could just flat-out prevent the PCs from killing any of the Big Bads: every time they corner him, they chip away at him in some narrative way, but he survives. Appropriate for some genres, but not all.<br/><br/>I bring this up because of the one time this issue arose when I was playing Dresden Files: We were fighting some asshole rogue sorcerer who was using magic in public and injuring, and threatening to kill, civilians. When the fight turned against him, the GM tried to have him concede, like running away or whatever, but that seemed like an unacceptable outcome for my no-holds-barred Warden. I was just like, nope, this is to the death. And then decapitated the fucker. I don't think it would have been appropriate to penalize me for refusing to accept a concession short of death: the guy had committed capital crimes, my character was lawman, and I was playing to my Aspects.<br/><br/>Is what avram said really how it works, RAW?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425262/#Comment_425262" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T22:26:17+00:00" title="December  4, 2013 10:26PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it is, but note that the rules as written don't permit anyone to force a concession on anyone else - the game group has to agree.

I guess if they don\u2019t like your concession, you can propose a new one?<br/>But\u2026 based on the Deliverators story.<br/>Since the Taken Out result gives you complete narration, and Concession only gives you veto power for the other players narration (and also gives the <i>conceding</i> party fate points), when you are sure to win (and have the patience for playing it out) it seems like you almost every time would go for Taken Out.<br/>It\u2019s almost like the doubling cube in backgammon. If you concede when the other player is already winning, you probably won\u2019t get your concession. And if you concede too soon, you maybe could still have won that battle\u2014since the outcome is unsure enough for the other player to accept your concession.<br/>Of course, maybe they accept the concession because they, even though they think they\u2019ll win, they don\u2019t want to take more Consequences in the process.<br/><br/>Now, I\u2019m not saying that I think the above interpretation is ideal\u2026 I\u2019m just trying to understand how they work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad" title="Wes_the_mad"><img alt="Wes_the_mad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nNGKML0VGFY5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad">Wes_the_mad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425283/#Comment_425283" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T08:05:58+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  8:05AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMO it all comes down to what is most interesting and what fits the theme/genre of your game. Remember, you're not (or shouldn't be at any rate) playing to "win". How I see it concessions are designed to simulate the classic example of the villian getting away. Look at most pulp media (the genre FATE seems to really be designed to emulate IMO). <br/><br/>The heroes corner the villian in his evil lab after a lengthy fight, "there's no escape !". "Ha, that's where you're wrong!" And POOF the villian dissapears in a cloud of smoke!<br/><br/>The villian is clearly loosing the battle and the hero makes some sort of attack with a social skill causing mentel stress. That hit is the point where the villian decides to conceed. He's been bested and he knows it. He gets away, but maybe he left some valuable info in his lair in his hasty retreat.<br/><br/>Sure, the hero PC could go, "nope your reign of terror ends here!" And veto the concession... And maybe in this instance that's the dramatically appropriate thing to do. It's all up to the group at the table, GM included, to decide if this is the appropriate place to end a story arc. Maybe the players like this particular villian and want to keep tangling with him. Maybe the villian is tied to one of the PC's in some way (twin, best friend, parent? Etc). Maybe it's time for a change of antagonist for the game. It's all a judgement call for everyone involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425323/#Comment_425323" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T14:51:07+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  2:51PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think making it unanimous is indeed a little problematic.

Hours of enjoyment, high-fiving and fist bumpin and all of a sudden someone wants to do something else and the others think it's not so great and the correct thing to do is to (I assume with a virtuous "more in sorrow than in anger" speech) pack up your stuff and leave the table as soon as possible, never returning, a feeling of deep relief sweeping over you.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't think of a better rule than that concessions must be unanimously approved by the game table, it just seemed like it could lead to a large number of dissatisfied people in some circumstances.  Interestingly, if we changed the rule to "the GM decides if concessions are good enough" we <i>guarantee</i> the satisfaction of the same number of players: one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425391/#Comment_425391" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T10:47:09+00:00" title="December  6, 2013 10:47AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But the issue isn't whether concessions are good enough\u2014it's whether there's even going to be a concession.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425394/#Comment_425394" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T11:03:46+00:00" title="December  6, 2013 11:03AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's the same thing?

In Burning Wheel (which is a phenomenal game; I have the later Gold edition, I don't know how Revised compares), both sides enter the conflict with a pre-determined goal. This has to be mutually agreeable. Goals are binary: they happen or they don't happen. This means that you usually have two orthogonal goals. If Side A wants to exile Side B, then Side B doesn't have to make their goal "I am not exiled", because if Side B wins, Side A's goal isn't gonna happen anyway.<br/><br/>Let's say that Side A's goal is: "You will accept exile from this country."<br/>Let's say that Side B's goal is: "You will agree to release the Black Fox from the dungeons."<br/><br/>Then, both sides determine their Body of Argument; it's effectively their hitpoints for the conflict. They chip away at one another, and then--when one side is dropped to 0 Body of Argument, they lose. At this point, you figure out compromises (unless one side blew the other away and sustained no damage).<br/><br/><i>If you lost a point or two,</i> you have to give up a minor compromise. Give up a small concession from your goal, or agree to a minor condition from the other side. <b>E.g.,</b> if Side A loses, but chipped a little bit off of Side B's BoA, then the Black Fox is released...but perhaps with a conspicuous brand on their face. (Ouch!) That's the extra condition behind Side A's intent.<br/><br/><i>If you lose a substantial amount,</i> you have to grant a big concession or extra condition. <b>E.g.,</b> Side A loses, but took a big chunk out of Side B. The Black Fox is released, but they're all exiled from the country for the span of a month, until the political situation dies down.<br/><br/><i>If you lost almost all of your BoA,</i> you get your goal, but it should "feel like losing". <b>E.g.,</b> Side A loses, but only narrowly. The Black Fox is released and branded. But Side B is arrested, branded, and released a week later, to teach them a lesson about standing up to Side A.<br/><br/>The compromise is discussed among all the players, and it should be honestly agreed on, within the guidelines. (And you need to be honest when you have to give a big concession! Take that hit!)<br/><br/>~~~<br/><br/>Back to the specific example in Fate, though--the intent of the characters should really be made clear. If the Warden wants to kill the warlock, then that should be spelled out. That makes the Concession rules easier to apply.<br/><br/>From the SRD, my emphasis in bold...\n<blockquote>Concession <b>gives the other person what they wanted from you</b>, or in the case of more than two combatants, removes you as a concern for the opposing side. You\u2019re out of the conflict, period.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Yes, you lost, and the narration has to reflect that. But you can\u2019t use this privilege to undermine the opponent\u2019s victory, either\u2014what you say happens has to pass muster with the group.</blockquote>\nConceding and saying "I get away" does <i>not</i> give the Warden what they wanted. Only death will. In that case, I think the GM should've been more creative. Thinking on that, I would probably say "I die, but not before I accomplish X." For instance, "I die, but as a Concession, I unleash my death curse on you." or "You kill me...just as I immolate a crowd of civilians." If they really want the kill, they have to live with the consequences. (That being said, I'm sure it was a speedy judgement by the GM.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425401/#Comment_425401" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T13:56:47+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  1:56PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2013 2:01PM by 2097.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great, CarpeGuitarrem.<br/>So the warden still has a chance of \xbbok, but I don\u2019t want the death curse, so let\u2019s battle on\xab and battles on until they get a taken out result, perhaps getting a few consequences in the process.<br/><br/>In my example, you were fighing against some \u201cdi sma\u201d.

I'm not 100% sure that I have everything right, but I think that's the gist. You concede, giving them what they wanted, buuuuut you don't entirely lose. You get something out of it too. And if someone's gonna play hardball ("I'm in it to kill"), I'm gonna play hardball right back. (This requires player buy-in, but I think it could be incredibly powerful if everyone gets that's how it works.)<br/><br/>I think you're on the spot with your example: the victor still gets a victory, but the loser manages something. "You drive me away...<b>for now</b>..." is an excellent example. Very villainy, too. Of note: most of the times in comics-style stories that the villain pulls a stunt like that, it's because they're the aggressor, and the protagonists are protecting something from them. The villain takes heavy hits, and Concedes with "You have fought well, but <b>YOU SHALL NOT BE SO LUCKY NEXT TIME</b>!" as they fly away on their SuperEviljet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425405/#Comment_425405" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T15:16:51+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  3:16PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I was specifically talking about FATE.
