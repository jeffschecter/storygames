If any of you spotted <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20109/what-are-the-components-of-social-combat#latest" rel="nofollow">my thread on Social Combat</a>, this game is why it came up. Fair warning, this uses very little of what was discussed in that thread, I think to do it any justice I'm gonna need to build a game based solely on those ideas.  At any rate, here it is. Let me know what you think.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3TMkYb-oWtbkdqdHNZWUNhS00/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Deadshot</a><br/><br/><b>Elevator Pitch:</b> Players play as half-human/half-constructs in the service of the Empire in a victorian steampunk setting. They seek to route out Sedition and Insurgency while trying to reconcile their new state of existence as not quite human creatures.<br/><br/>I set out some weird goals for myself in creating this one.  Probably not good design practice. I wanted to make a small system that:<br/>A) Had a method for determining Hit Location in combat<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Had a method for character advancement<br/>C) Was 10 pages or less.<br/><br/>I failed at the last goal, it clocks in at 13 pages not including the title page, but I did accomplish the other two.  I just don't know how playable it is.  After writing it up, I realized I probably wouldn't want to play it, but I do like some of the ideas in there.  Oh well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
