They just wanted to be left alone most of the time and they had built an enormous wall on their main border. All the other races still thought of them as Terribly Evil and insisted on fighting against them. The PCs were magically polymorphed into various goblinoid forms by a powerful magician so they could infiltrate the goblin kingdom to spy on them. The PCs came to appreciate goblin culture so much that they didn't want to go back home.<br/><br/>In another setting, I got rid of gnomes. The "tinker" role went to dwarves, who built very effective machine-monsters. They used these to wage war on other races. They were the Great Evil of the world most of the time. The most heinous dwarven machine invention was a giant, spiderlike lumber-cutting machine. These automata were hell-bent on clearcutting forests. The dwarves needed the wood as fuel for their deep-mountain iron forges, of course. Obviously, this is why tree-loving elves hate dwarves so much. The PCs ended up making an alliance with the dwarves so they could overthrow the human king, who was a demonist.<br/><br/>In a couple campaigns, my human races were led by dragon-kings and occasionally demon-kings. Most people didn't know they were dragons, since they spent most of their time in human form. I do this because I have a hard time believing that a world can have elder dragons and powerful demons or devils in it and not have them in charge of shit. Why not other races? Eh, they were interesting enough already, I guess.<br/><br/>Those are things I've actually done in games. I posted about things I want to do in future games in that other thread a couple weeks ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227622/#Comment_227622" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T13:07:58+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  1:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my old DnD 3.5 (and subsequently BW) campaigns featured dwarves as a xenophobic race of technologically obsessed people, who were nearly extinct. They employed steampower technology to wage war on some unnamed 'great evil' from below. They were the only race that was not in the dark ages, due to their monopoly on things like coal power.<br/>\n<br/>\nElves in that same setting were divided into Jade Elves, and 'True' Elves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJade Elves lived in the forests, and were a warlike race of druids who spoke with wolves and forest spirits. The True Elves and Jade Elves were blood enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue' Elves were a mysterious sorcerous race from across the ocean, who set up enclaves in most major human cities. They worked with the human church to wage an inquisition on non-True Elven magic users.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227650/#Comment_227650" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T14:22:12+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  2:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In an old, homebrew thing, I had "gaunts" instead of elves, "brugs" instead of ogres, "greenies" instead of goblins, and "squats" instead of dwarves. With the exception of squats, they all got carried over into my Rustbelt campaigns too.<br><br>Gaunts are thin, kinda eerie, with large, nocturnal eyes. They never seem to be wholly there -- it's like they could vanish at any moment. Sometimes you turn your head for just a second, and they do vanish. They're inclined towards magic, which, in the setting, was an uncommon, highly uncanny thing.<br><br>Brugs are hairy, smelly, strong, and surprisingly (but secretly) intelligent. They're rumored to eat anything, including people, and to have voracious sexual appetites. They never accept or offer favors. They take extreme offense to the term "brug."<br><br>Greenies are wiry, and have skin that's sort of a yellow-green, as if they had jaundice. Their eyes have the jaundice look, too. Their fingers are clawlike, and their teeth are thin and pointed, like nails. They are extremely loyal, to the extent that it makes you suspicious. They have a knack for electronics and garage science.<br/><br/>Squats are short, hairy, and thick. They're heavy drinkers, and they like to gamble, whore, and brawl. They also like motorcycles, firearms, and explosives. Combined, if at all possible.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227662/#Comment_227662" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T14:43:09+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  2:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I haven't done, but have toyed with for a potential long-term shared-world is a set of directional themes, with each direction being controlled by one player and the place they set their games.<br/><br/>So, to clarify: imagine a West Marches type game, with 4 regular players. Each player is also GM for one direction. If the party heads east from the starting town, then E runs, and can set all the details. Same with West, South, and North. That way you get the collaborative world-building without having to worry about stepping on each others' toes ("hey, you got Aztec all over my Samurai Elves!"; "nope, Japan").<br/><br/>I guess I'm drifting the thread a little, but that kind of game would give the whole group free reign to come up with whatever reinventions of fantasy races they wanted, and all could coexist, maybe with some blending at the borders. So if my elves of the north were growly Alfar, and your elves of the east were sophisticated city-builders, maybe the elves of the northeast are some blend of the two (or entirely unrelated).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227716/#Comment_227716" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T17:11:44+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  5:11PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my <a href="http://juddgoswick.com/NeverHome/NeverHomeMain.htm" rel="nofollow">"Never Home"</a> game, I took the idea of standard D&amp;D races and tried to retool or alter them in linw with my idea of consumerist magic.<br/><br/>Elves - Warped by the loss of their Empress centuries ago, they seek vengeance on the Gnomes who killed her and the Humans and Dwarves the Gnomes now protect and Guide.  They were very powerful mystical creatures, Elementally tied to  the Element of Earth, they took many of its aspects - inflexibility, toughness, absorbed in the past, and slow to change their ideas or ways.  They had a Cult that worshiped the Earth Mother and did not allow fire that was not blessed by the Earth Mother (which wouldn't burn wood or flesh, and served as the eyes and ears of the Elf Lords).  They were served by Stickmen, golems they made from living wood that began to rot as the Elves became corrupted.<br/><br/>Dwarves - Pretty much the standard fare for Dwarves, but they were starting to become children of the Water Rune and not Earth.  They were losing their ability to work stone and metal as if it were clay and were starting to gain the ability to live below the waves.<br/><br/>Gnomes - Gnomes were collections of magical crystals that projected illusions of the traditional Gnomish body about them,  they served the Moon Rune and were tied to magic and the unreal.  They were massive manipulators of the destiny of the races that came after the Firsts (Elves, Gnomes, Djinns, Pixies, and Tritons - each tied to a Rune: Earth, Moon, Fire, Air, and Water).  The Gnomes taught the Humans and the Dwarves crafting and social living and gave the Wizards Guild it start, but began to regret what they had done.<br/><br/>Djinns - Missing and trapped since the Elves sealed them in metal and stone prisons (lamps, etc).  They were the lovers of the stars above, and when the Elves learned they intended to call the starts to come to live on the world, the Elves imprisoned them (in return, the Gnomes drove the Elf Empress insane).  Djinns are able to steal the potential from one thing to give it to another thing.  This is how they grant the wishes they are bound to supply to their Elf masters (or whoever can free them for a time).<br/><br/>Tritons - The Tritons were never seen in the game, despite the fact that the Sea of Larga is named after their King.  The Tritons gave the land above their Kingdom to the Gnomes, who shared it with the humans and Dwarves.  They were mentioned once as having the ultimate say in First Politics because they could, if desired, drown the world with rising waters.<br/><br/>The Pixies  - So great and touched by knowledge and the other wonders of the Air Rune, there are only 50 of them at any time.  Sadly, their hidden warren's location was betrayed to the Thri'kreen, Goblins, and Kobolds (the fun, doggie kind only they are clades of massminds with somewhere around 60-70 kobolds making up a clade) by the Elves.  When the bad guys showed up, they found the Pixies already dead, eatern by the Orks they summonded from beyond.<br/><br/>Orks - The truth is, the Orks are the Pixies.  50 of the most magically potent Pixie-mecha you could find in the Elseworlds were purchased and the construction the Ork-heart insured the ruse.  The Ork-Heart is a Air Rune artifact that makes rumors and innuendo about the Ork feel dreadful and true.  It is for this reason that while the Orks never took a human city, everyone had heard of a city they had sacked and knew a guy who knew someone lost there.<br/><br/>The Orks fought the Wizard Guild to a standstill over the use of Orbital Mirrors over their lands.  Actually, it was just one Ork - Ender of Tales...the legendary killer of the Orks.<br/><br/>Dragons - the only intelligent creatures in the world who do not share the Moon's gift of language (because of the mystic runes carved on the moon in scree, everyone speaks the same language)<br/><br/>Minor notes:<br/><br/>Thri'kreen: think locust swarm meets instant death.  Their hives were walled away by Pixie magic and they were freed in special enclosed zones during battle to wipe the area clean.<br/><br/>Kobolds - fuzzy, fun, and somewhat noble.  They used to work for the Goblins out to fear, but now serve the "Orks" because they are immune to the Ork-Heart and are in on the con.  Each kobold personality (or clade) has about 30 bodies or so that move and a pile of "used" bodies that it piles up in the homeland to serve as additional mass for the others.<br/><br/>Goblins - mechanical whiz-kids with a tribal culture similar to warring mobster families.  The Orks are getting them to chill out a bit and expand their culture to something a bit less Machiavellian...<br/><br/>Halflings - used to live in a Shire-like environment, until the Elf Battle-Mandarin of Water turned it into a frozen tundra - now they eat anyone they get their hands on.  Brutal and practical, with a huge chip on their shoulders...  My nod to Dark Sun.<br/><br/>Lizardmen - kind of an echo of Chinese culture, they were not a huge part of the game.  They were the organizers and functionaries of the Elf Empire.<br/><br/>Trolls - the Trolls were all people from Earth who came from an Elseworld portal.  Most of them were US Marine Corps members with the Initials "LM" - no one knows why.  They are super strong (like John Carter) and are on average much taller than normal humans (who are about 4'9' in our terms).<br/><br/>TL;DR - I blab about my old FATE game...which I apparently am very proud of and miss...sniff sniff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227725/#Comment_227725" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T17:41:32+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  5:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one game our Dwarves were incredibly ancient and dwindling in numbers. Their purpose was to gather and store knowledge for the coming apocalypse. They held the secrets of inscribing magic onto things, whether it be metal, stone or paper. The reason they were so short and stocky was because their heads were about a third of their body length. They effectively were walking brains, recording history and knowledge. They were both revered and hated because they held all of the secrets, and with their knowledge you could cure disease, create wonders and make life better. But their job wasn't to use the knowledge or share the knowledge, only to keep it, store it, and wait.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227733/#Comment_227733" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T18:16:14+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  6:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My <a href="http://home.att.net/~pbaronson/TheWorldofNinazu.html" rel="nofollow">World of Ninazu</a> setting that I ran using True20 was pieced together from stuff I through into my kid's bedtime stories (GMing as a parenting skill!).

It's not like you couldn't win the lottery tomorrow - or in a hundred years, or whatever.<br/><br/>There's no reason to plan ahead when the drawbacks of not doing so are essentially nonexistent. Humans congregate in bars and dance halls because like May flies they are trying to breed before they die; the immortals aren't going to and aren't going to exert themselves over it.<br/><br/>Humans worry about "making a difference" before they go. Elves probably feel that if they ignore problems long enough they'll go away. Simply, an elf has no need for change. If something has worked in the past, no matter how poorly or how well, the elf will never change it.<br/><br/>If you thought old people were conservative - you haven't seen anything until you've seen a nearly immortal person.<br/><br/>Consider the value of change: in exchange for uncertainty and possible death, you get the promise of a potentially better life. Human lives are short and uncertain anyway - so the "drawback" of change is largely ignored. But elves have long lives and a great deal of certainty. Their potential losses are a hundred times greater than the human's - and their potential gains are exactly the same.<br/><br/>Add to that the problem of proofreading. When you write something, it's hard to find the typos; your eyes skip over the mistakes you've made because you already think of it as being spelled the correct way. But if someone comes in with a fresh set of eyes they spot the errors right away because they don't know what it's "supposed" to say.<br/><br/>Humans get a fresh set of eyes all the time. Whole generations turn over every 20 years - new sets of eyes are turned to each problem five times every century. But the elves can go an entire century without getting a fresh viewpoint at all. By the time a new viewpoint comes in, there's no guarantee that anyone will listen to it.<br/><br/>Amongst humans there are truly ideas "whose time has come" - but among elves, why would that ever happen?<br/><br/>Fewer new ideas combined with a more tenacious hold on the old ways come together to form a quagmire of conservatism that is unmatched in human history. We're talking a conservatism that exceeds anything that the most book burning, serf oppressing human society has ever achieved.<br/><br/>And that's normal for them. It's what they expect. And they will violently defend it, no matter how stupid it looks to anyone from the outside. It works for them - it has worked for thousands of years- and if you think you have a better way , you could not possibly be right. </blockquote>\nI used this as inspiration to portray elves as deeply conservative traditionalists, which meant that they came off as hicks and bumpkins to most of the players. Think about meeting someone today who felt that the way things were done in 2009 B.C. was still the best way to do things in 2009 A.D., including food production and bridge building and legal systems and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227757/#Comment_227757" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T22:08:28+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 10:08PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my D&amp;D game, Dwarves are pretty much what you would expect them to be, though there's two major cultural factions: traditionalists, aka Digger Dwarves, who like to live underground, mine, worship Moradain exclusively, and are anti-change, and the revisionists, aka Builder Dwarves, who like to live aboveground, build buildings, worship Moradain as part of a larger pantheon, and are pro-progress.<br/><br/>They do not get along at all, but economically, they need each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227790/#Comment_227790" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T04:02:58+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  4:02AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the setting for Mage Blade, I made a few small twists.<br/>\n<br/>\n500 (give or take) years ago, a great and powerful human empire was toppled when its leader was taken down by treachery. The surviving leaders of the empire squabbled over the remains, plunging the world into a dark age.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Fae, who were instrumental in taking the leader down, chose some of their number to stand eternal watch over his otherworldly prison, for he could not be killed, having discovered the secrets of true immortality. These who stayed within the human world to guard the prison became mortal, as the sealing of the prison necessitated closing off the ways to Arcadia. These, calling themselves the Ael'fae also ended up with singular forms, unlike the protean existences they'd lived as Fae. They lived longish lives (100 years was a reasonable life expectancy) so there has been approximately 5 generations since the beginning of the dark age.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the dark age, the embodiments of the element of Earth saw the land scarred and desecrated by the magical weapons of war used by the generals of the old empire. They took it upon themselves to try to heal these wounds, and created a race of humanoid sentients to assist them in their work. Thus were born the dwarves. They are skilled at all tasks intimately involving the earth, from farming to mining and wood and metalcraft. They are culturally very environmentally aware, due to their origins, and likewise tend to distrust humans, as it was they who'd originally marred so much of the land.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrcs have been around as long as anyone remembers, and as long as any written history mentions. They were largely relegated to second-class citizens in the old empire, and when it fell, they tried to carve out their own piece. Over time, this distracted the warring factions enough that their collective efforts were turned to exterminating and enslaving the orcish peoples. Though some survived in isolated freedom, the majority of the orcish race became slaves for almost two hundred years. Five years before 'the present', a charismatic leader and a talented young orcish mage led an uprising that ended with the orcish peoples being given a small kingdom of their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227796/#Comment_227796" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T04:52:23+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  4:52AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hobbits live in the sewers and breed uncontrollably, their numbers only being kept in check by the neep tides and the spring thaw up in the mountains.<br><br>Elves are amoral Shub-Niggurath worshippers, just as likely to kiss you as to plant a seed in your ear which grows a tree in you brain.

This was in 2E and I'd gotten ahold of my buddies Monstrous Compendium with all kinds of neat off color dragons in it so I used like, yellow, brown and shadow dragons as opposed to blue, black and red.  The seven ancient cities were each destroyed by a dragon lord which had been summoned from another world.  Anyway... the point here is that instead of being attracted to a certain sort of terrain (red=mountain, etc.) the dragons presence created that terrain wherever they laired.  So the net effect was that each of these ancient cities was buried in a different terrain.  One swallowed by the sands, one sank into the swamp, one scattered across the mountainsides...<br/><br/>It was fun worldbuilding.  I wish we'd gotten to explore more than one city.

Obviously there was a big emphasis on self-sufficiency, there. Dwarves, likewise, were the "Lawful" race: not inclined towards good or evil one way or another, but disciplined traditionalists. They had most of the really impressively large cities (mostly theocratic, but not all).<br/><br/>The southeast had Swamp Elves, which I basically described as "They're pointy-eared Reavers with magic."

HellGate is a sort of mix between spell-jammers, stargate, and TORG in that many planes exist but travel to them could end up forcing the visitor to transmute to meet the laws of that world. Only by shifting the paradigms of a world could one freely travel within its boundaries which is usually is performed by military force via HellGates. <br/>\n  Humanity being without HellGates (and thus lame) oh so cleverly created a "meme plague" in which a TORG storm lord like operative would careful administer the mental imprint of a feasible plague like contraction which would then mutate the recipient into a human. Through the morbid metamorphoses period and after humans would remain contagious and capable of spread human to other beings. As the general acceptance of humanity spreads soldiers will begin to infiltrate and create uprisings in hopes of shifting the paradigm to be more people friendly.<br/>\n  A meme plague is a tough bit though and some times the message can get a little blurred causing infected to mutate to something close to human (but not exactly) and if they spread the meme to quickly the war can quickly be lost. Giants are the result of infected dragons, elves the result of infected dryads, and gnomes, dwarves,  and goblins are all the result of kobolds.<br/>\n"Don't go pink on me now...

Like, if I were using GB Steve's ideas, I'd base them on Goliath and Deva to cleanse the palate.<br/><br/>Spoilers for my campaign follow:<br/><br/>In my game, Goliaths are called Graven, and don't have stony buildups on their skin, just really thick, hard hide (like the plates on the back of a rhino).  They impress/engrave tattoos on themselves with their family history, giving special care to the events of their own lifetime and placing names of the people they are close to over their hearts.  When they die, they are ritually skinned, and these skins, which are very durable, are treasured possessions of their descendants. <br/><br/>Devas in my game are called Shining Eyes, and are undergoing a tremendous culture shock: Thousands of years ago they got sick of the conflicts of the world, and established a permanent societal order for themselves, in which the reincarnated rotate through society's roles.  They deliberately blocked off their realm from the rest of the world, and while that barrier persists, they are finally (after 10k+ years) unable to deal with problems that are happening to them.  In fact, they haven't even been able to leave their realm, because the safeguards are too dangerous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228188/#Comment_228188" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T12:13:35+00:00" title="August 27, 2009 12:13PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2009 12:16PM by Valamir.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll do part 2 first:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought process is that I LIKE the core races.  To the extent that I immediately mark a strike against any game that uses the idea of "fantasy races" but then feels the need to invent something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I like the core races is precisely because there IS so much baggage around them, much of it contradictory.  To me this makes them seem much more complex and thus "real" then starting from scratch with nothing but a one page write up.  Because real cultures are complex.  There are lots of things people "know" about say...the French...much of it contradictory, much of it wrong, much of it right but for different time periods, much of it right but for different regions of France, and much of it just inflammatory BS.  But regardless when someone says "French" there's this HUGE pile of stuff that people free associate with the word.  A huge pile of stuff that you have to sort through and cull and accept or dismiss or add to when you actually start interacting with real people who happen to be French.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly there are lots of things people "know" about Dwarves...much of it contradictory.  Much of it will be wrong for any given application of dwarf.  Etc, etc.  Enough stuff has accumulated in the common gamer knowledge base about Dwarves or Elves that saying "Dwarf" or "Elf" evokes much the same range of responses as saying "French".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn't happen when you create a new race from scratch or a hack that is SO different that the knowledge base just doesn't address.  For me THOSE races feel sterile, artifical, and..."made up".  Dwarves and Elves and Orcs feel much more "real" because of all of the accumulated baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result, you can do things with these common races that you can't really do with made-up-from-scratch races.  You can play your player's baseline assumptions against your current in-game portrayals in a way much closer to how people in the real world have their baseline assumptions challenged or confirmed when they start to interact with real individuals rather than stereotypes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying to and against stereotypes is an extraordinarily powerful roleplaying tool.  One that is completely lost if you play with new and unfamiliar races because either no one knows what the stereotypes are supposed to be or the stereotypes are so 2 dimensional as to be silly caricatures rather than deep cultural expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo go back to Part 1 then, what I do is try to use this effect to my advantage.  Much the way Dark Sun did with Elves and Dwarves and Halflings that were close enough to the common knowledge base to get this "feels real" effect but different enough so that your "stereotype assumptions" get turned on their head.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'll do simple things.  Like have part of the world where Elves and Dwarves are the best of friends and the closest of allies to the extent of having cross species marriages and offspring.  When the players do their traditional "Elf and Dwarf bickering at each other routine" because they're playing up their assumed stereotype and then encounter the culture in my campaign they have that "whoa...cultural adjustment" effect that I enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I find the most impact by honing pretty close and then tweaking just one or two things, like:  Making the Elves savage and cruel and mundane instead of enlightened and magical.  Making the Elves cruel dominators of the environment twisting the trees and the plants to do their bidding rather than hippy green caretakers of nature.  Making Dwarves live in caves because they're too lazy and non industrious to actually build anything.  Or making them go hairless and beardless because "geeze, why would you want all that hair...it would just get filthy down in the mines".  Or making halflings amoral swindlers instead of hospitable gluttons.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust little things.  And switch it up even with a campaign world.  Why should humans have a bunch of distinct cultures but all elves in the world are the same.  Why should each different elven culture require a different elven race?  Why do "wood elves" and "high elves" have to be different races?  Why can't they just be elves who live differently?  That sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228211/#Comment_228211" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T13:12:54+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  1:12PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a TSOY game where goblins were corrupted dwarves, and the dwarf race was dwindling because they were all getting corrupted (by their own morals and standards).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228212/#Comment_228212" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T13:21:22+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  1:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>This doesn't happen when you create a new race from scratch or a hack that is SO different that the knowledge base just doesn't address.

That sort of thing.</blockquote>\nOh, wow, this reminds me of a game that I sketched up in my teens but never actually played. It was supposed to start in an early Bronze Age, prehistory kind of thing, with a handful of different cultures per race, with different ability biases and environments. And, periodically, play would shift forward a generation or two, and changes to the world and cultures would occur based on the cultures' statistics and the things that the PCs accomplished in the preceding interim. <br><br>(WTF, why didn't I <i>play</i> that?)<br><br>Anyway, I can remember a few of them. The humans all started off as totemic cultures; I remember a Crow Clan, a Lion Clan, and a Bear Clan, but there were probably others. Their abilities were based on their totems; e.g. the Crows were scavengers, had a written language already, and were more likely to develop tools first; the Lions were hunters, and better suited to warfare; the Bears were gatherers and fishermen, and were the hardiest of the humans. All of this was <i>starting out</i>, mind you; this stuff was subject to change from generation to generation. Cultures could splinter, and so on.<br><br>Let's see, I can remember the Dire Rock dwarves, who were stocky, hairy, and started with bronze technology. The Haunt Rock dwarves were taller, and thin, with longer beards but less hair in general, and they had a good chance to develop magic, and also cloth.<br><br>The elves started off unified, but would, in one of the first few generations of play, receive dispensations from three conflicting deities, which would almost certainly prompt a three-part schism (or four-part, if a group declined to worship <i>any</i> of the three gods). And then a war, which any combination of the elven cultures might survive or be annihilated.<br><br>I can't remember the ogres, but I know they were there. Trolls were there too, but for some reason didn't evolve to trolldom until a few generations into play. There were several clans of goblins (I've never really felt comfortable about using the term "orc" outside of Middle Earth, so my goblins are actually a combination of Tolkien's orcs and your contemporary fantasy goblins -- it just depends on whether a given goblin is born big and scary or scrawny and sharp), of which I can only remember the Dead Crow clan, who started with witchcraft and were the most likely to contact demons first.<br><br>Man, I gotta see if I can find the old notes for this fucker.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228260/#Comment_228260" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T16:45:14+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  4:45PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing which I like to use is that "Orc" is more of a verb than a race.

They gain their immortality from magical water drawn from a particular well. This is of course quite an excellent adventure hook, especially since the placement is on the other side of Jotunheim, the land of giants.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
