Maybe with some support it could grow into a very solid mecha game, it already have very nice features.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed:<br/>- The scene structure of one scene by players, then one GM scene followed by a battle is really great. It give the game a great pacing, and having a battle after every table turn is really fun. It a nice tool to control the pacing, sometime the table turn cover a long downtime, some time it cover the few seconds you have to catch your breath between two attack waves. <br/><br/>- The bulleye map battles are fun and dynamic. Fighting to control the map objective instead of destroying or killing your opponent is great. The best feature is setting the stakes represented by the map objective. It drive the narration forward and it help to define what going on the next table turns. You can set your stakes to resolve a huge battle in one fight or you can decompose your objective into many stakes won over multiple linked fights. <br/><br/>- Earning overdrive is like earning candy. Mecha configuration are fun and colorful.<br/><br/>- When damaged, players have the choice to retire out of fight or to keep fighting and to escalade the conflict by putting their pilot life on the line. It a way for the player to say: "I am game to risk my character life in this fight! Bring it on!" <br/><br/>- The game give you some tools to "burn" your own mecha setting. <br/><br/>- The game have some cool random tables, a little bit like in Maids. We had a lot of fun with those tables!<br/><br/><br/>What need more work:<br/><br/>- The attribute dice pool with skills as target numbers is weird. I would prefer a constant target number. <br/><br/>- The setting burning is shy, it a great feature who need more love from the game author.<br/><br/>- The random table are shy, we want more of them, lot more of them! And they also need more love! <br/><br/>- The scene economy is cool, but it could also receive more attention. There is stuff about having a secondary social goal when playing a scene, but it shy, and it could be better included into the system. We house ruled that you could choose to fail you secondary social goal to get a reroll or something on your main roll. <br/><br/>- The character sheet in the book is original but really not printer and usable friendly. I had to create my own.<br/><br/>- There is no cool designed bulleye map included in the book! I had to create my own.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314242/#Comment_314242" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T13:39:14+00:00" title="February 25, 2011  1:39PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2011 1:47PM by commondialog.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cedric,<br/><br/>Thanks for the post.  We needed a little kick to get something out about Mecha and our plans for the future.  Let me say that it is our intent to continue supporting Mecha and give it the love it deserves.  Unfortunately, until the last week or so we\u2019ve been limited to planning and not a lot of doing.  However, that\u2019s all changing.<br/><br/>Right now there are three big things we have going on with Mecha for sure:\n<ol>\n<li>Mecha Combiners \u2013 People have been asking for Voltron rules for Mecha since before we released it.  So, in the next month (we hope), we\u2019ll have a beta draft of Combiners rules.  The beta draft won\u2019t be pretty, but the rules should be there.  I\u2019ll post here when that happens.</li>\n<li>Mecha Tokusatsu \u2013 It\u2019s funny you posted this because this week someone approached us with the idea to do a Tokusatsu SRS (Power Rangers) and we\u2019ve entered into an agreement to buy his work when he\u2019s done.  We obviously welcome anyone who wants to approach us with SRS ideas (a few of which are listed on srssource.mecharpg.com now that I got the spam off the site.)</li>\n<li>Gen Con- I have signed up to run 5 sessions of Mecha at Gen Con, so I hope people get the chance to play.</li>\n</ol>\nWith that said, I want you to know we really appreciate all the praise for the game.  The fact you\u2019ve played it multiple times and had good experiences with it is great.<br/><br/>As for some of the flaws you point out, you make really excellent points that I would like to address and get some clarification on.<br/><br/>First, in regards to the system, can you tell me a bit more on why you don\u2019t like the variable target numbers?  Something like that will be hard to rip from the OCF! system, but I\u2019d be interested to know more about what you did not like.<br/><br/>The scarcity of the section on setting creation\u2026guilty.  Unfortunately, setting creation fell by the wayside as we got near to publication time.  I had wanted to do something like the World Burner from Burning Empires, but I never had time.  I will try to revisit this soon.  My guess is it will look something like the questionnaire in Blossoms, but that\u2019s where my head is now.<br/><br/>Next, I am really happy you used the random event tables.  We used them a lot at the beginning of playtesting, but over time, they fell out of use.  This may account for why there are only 2.  May I ask what you use them for?  I will be more than happy to add more tables if they will help.  In the meantime, I\u2019ll crack open Maid as it\u2019s the king of random table games. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Social scenes\u2026okay, I will admit, I never gave giving the secondary goal much mechanical weight until you suggested it.  Your house rule is a good idea and so I\u2019m going to play around with what I can do to make the social goal more a part of the game.<br/><br/>Last, as for the lack of battlemap and character sheet\u2026yeah, those were big oversights that we tried to correct by putting the sheet on <a href="http://mecharpg.com" rel="nofollow">MechaRPG.com</a> and <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Mecha+Paper+Minis&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;quicksearch=1&amp;search_filter=&amp;filters=&amp;search_free=&amp;search_in_description=1&amp;search_in_author=1&amp;search_in_artist=1" rel="nofollow">DriveThru</a>.  We also put paper mini sets up on DriveThru with larger sized battlemaps.  It looks like we did a bad job of telling the world about it.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>In the future, we\u2019re looking to release a new battlemap with the turns of combat on it, a way to track initiative, and maybe an overview of Configurations for quick reference.   However, I am curious about why you did your own character sheets?  Too much ink?  Too crowded?  Too ugly?  Let me know and we\u2019ll look into it.<br/><br/>Edit: Formatting and adding hyperlinks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314254/#Comment_314254" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T13:55:06+00:00" title="February 25, 2011  1:55PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been spending more time than is healthy thinking about running a Forth Succession Wars-era Battletech world with Mecha.

Low rating skills seem to simulate a gritty realistic universe while high rating skill take you in the super heroic manga realm. It strange that both coexist together. Maybe low rating skills could be geared toward comedy to fit the genre together with the high rating skills. Because character with a rating 1 skill seem VERY clumsy, socially inept, stupids, etc. In our games players with rating 1 skills had two kind of reaction to having nearly no expectation to succeed with those skills: 1) avoid any use of those skills or 2) revel in the clumsiness of their skill and use them a lot to get into all kind of goofy trouble. The player who reveled in their clumsiness had way more fun VS a player who had 1 in social and felt like he could not play any social scenes because it was not worth it.<br/><br/>We were tempted to hack the game by simply removing all the skills and just using a target number of 3 for all the tests and letting the attribute and the number of success determine the test difficulty. Also one thing that is confusing is that the difficulty of a test is determined by 3 factors: your skill rating who give you a target number, your attribute score who give how many dice you roll and the difficulty of the task who determine the number of success needed to succeed. It felt to us that removing 1 factor could be good.  <br/><br/>Setting creation:<br/>All the groups who tried the game were really looking forward the setting creation phase. I think it go with the genre, you just want to recreate your favorite mecha setting or to create your own dream setting. It a huge buy-in for the game. Creating a setting alone as the GM work fine, but it would help to have some tools to create a setting together as a group.  <br/><br/>One thing I have done that was really cool, was asking the players to create their own mecha, then to tell them: "ok you just created the basic mecha of the setting, your mecha will be the core models of the setting, you better give them cool model names ;-)" It was fun later when they fought enemy piloting their mecha models. And when I introduced a mecha model of my own, it got a lot of attention. (Naturally this can't apply to all kind of setting)<br/><br/>A other thing that was fun: to create our own damage types, we came up with: cold, soul, acid, sonic, magma, gamma, etc. They add a lot of color to the game. <br/>But sadly weapon damage types only come up when someone use the defender configuration. This could be one of the cool stuff to choose during the setting creation: will damage type be heavily featured?<br/><br/>The random tables: <br/>We used them each time we introduced a NPC, each time I gave them the choice to roll on the relation or the emotion table.<br/>I also told the players that on their turn they had the choice to initiate their own scene framing or to roll on the player event table to spice things up or to inspire them when they din't know what to frame. (With one of the groups I had a lot of player scene framing blanc page syndrome, but that was maybe my fault) <br/>With one group, we house ruled that we could spend 1AP(xp) to get a reroll on the tables. <br/>I also used the GM table on my GM turn when I was improvising a lot. <br/><br/>Maids use of random tables is definitely something to check up. ;-)<br/>Before reading some threads here on storygame about the use of random tables I was kind of sceptic about their use, but man I am glad I have re-discovered them, they are fun tools!<br/><br/>Initiative: <br/>Yeah tracking initiative is a pain. At first I was also very sceptical about having to roll initiatives, but when you play for the objective, initiative become very important and quite exciting when someone have the control of the objective at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>Soaking damage:<br/>In one game with 3 rookies mecha pilot with mecha combat skill of 1 or 2, damaging other mechas was a pain as they soaked nearly all the damages. But this was related to the skills setting the target numbers. With the other groups I dint have this problem. But we still house ruled that on a tie, the defending mecha dont add a notch to it damage track, but it have to make a stability roll. <br/><br/>The Character sheet:<br/>Too much grey area to write on, it become a mess when you erase stuff. Also with some printers (like mine), the printed result is full of lines or well... just ugly.  <br/><br/>If you need playtesters give me a sign, one of the group I played with is still quite interested by the game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314608/#Comment_314608" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T20:29:57+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  8:29PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cedric,<br/><br/>I appreciate you letting me know what needs more love.  Feedback from people who like (and hate the game) can only make it better.<br/><br/>Re: variable target numbers.  I understand your frustration with low target numbers, but part of the reason they are there is to emulate the fact that in mecha anime, characters tend to have something they do really well (schmooze, make cool gadges, etc.) and some things really poorly (the guy who can schmooze can't make gadgets, and vice versa.)  I do have one thought...the character archeytpes you used...did they get 3 Skill points at character creation?  One of the prepackaged SRSes omitted the Skill Points for the archetypes and so it may not be readily apparent as it should be that EVERY archetype is built off of having 8 points divvied amongst the skills and 3 to spend as the character wants.  Therefore, a character never need to have less than a 3 in Mecha Combat.<br/><br/>Thanks for the setting creation ideas.  I'm going to incorporate them into some brainstorming I am going to do.<br/><br/>Also, weapon damage is a mechanic that does, indeed, need to be fleshed out.  I am working on some optional rules for buildings and terrain (for a Kaiju supplement) where Damage Types will start to play a bigger role.  I am also thinking of some Anti-Configurations which are like weaknesses or flaws which damage types could exploit.<br/><br/>Ah, now I see how you use random tables.  I can work with that!<br/><br/>Thanks for letting me know about the character sheet.  I'll see if the artist that drew it can clean up the gray at the very least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317151/#Comment_317151" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T00:41:59+00:00" title="March 19, 2011 12:41AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2011 12:42AM by commondialog.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cedric, Wordman (and anyone else)<br/><br/>I just put together a LONG post about Mecha Setting Creation.

I found it worthwhile, though.  As for the setting, I'll have to see what the group I'm going to run MECHA for prefers -- they may well want a collaboratively built setting instead.  But if I do end up building it, I'll let you know.  I'm thinking of setting things during the period (alluded to in the book) when the Great Redoubt and the Lesser Redoubt were still in regular communications, and having the Mecha guarding the land route between then against the monsters and abhumans.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318045/#Comment_318045" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T07:23:55+00:00" title="March 29, 2011  7:23AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2011 7:27AM by Wordman.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: commondialog</cite>I would love to see a Fourth Succession War-era Battletech game/SRS.</blockquote>\nI'm getting close to a readable draft of this. It's a bit more of a toolkit than a typical SRS. But that will be more clear when I release it.<br/><br/>I am running into one thing regarding configurations though, that I thought might be more generally useful for Mecha fans/designers.<br/><br/>I'm realizing that the mechanics of some configurations give me a totally different picture than is presented by the "flavor" (or even name) of that configuration. Since you spend Overdrive to use configuration, using configurations feel more like "stunts" to me, and some of the configurations have flavor that seems opposite to the mechanical "stunt" I imagine for it.<br/><br/>Bulwark is, perhaps, the best example of this. This configuration allows you to use Movement dice as Attack dice. Which is great. The description, however, says this: "Bulwarks are slow and lumbering, but the [sic] pack a deadly punch. They are able to trade their maneuverability for offensive strength". Now, it makes total sense that a mech might be <i>designed</i> to be slow in order to pack on more weapons, but that isn't a configuration. That is a choice made when you pick stats: you make Speed low and Weapons high. Further, since a "slow and lumbering" mech will have a low Speed, this configuration isn't that useful to it, because he can't translate that many dice. It seems to me that you'd want to put this configuration on a mech that is fairly fast.<br/><br/>In other words, when considering a "stunt" that uses movement to attack, you (or, at least, I) think of a fast mech using its speed and maneuverability as a weapon. A death from above attack comes to mind, or a "slip through the defenses to land the perfect shot" sort of thing or, maybe "I jump really high and riddle him with fire to the head".<br/><br/>Heavy Metal is a similar example, where a "stunt" that exchanges movement for defense seems more like "I'm bobbing and weaving too fast for you to hit me", rather than "becoming very stout, almost rooted to the ground".<br/><br/>Another way to make this point, using a BattleTech example: when picking configurations for mechs, the <i>mechanics</i> of Bulwark make me want to put it on, say, a <i>Phoenix Hawk</i>, while the <i>flavor text</i> seems to want me to put in on a <i>Stalker</i>.<br/><br/>What am I missing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323379/#Comment_323379" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-06T23:59:08+00:00" title="May  6, 2011 11:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wordman,<br/><br/>I think you're missing that putting faith in my writing can be a dangerous, dangerous thing.<br/><br/>In this case, I think your confusion is warranted because I had a clear picture in my head of the way the Configurations worked and I assumed that everyone shared the vision in my head.<br/><br/>In particular, I think Bulwark would have been better if I had written "Bulwarks become slow so they can pack a deadly punch."  That was kind of my intent, but I can see that it was not clearly communicated.<br/><br/>As for Heavy Metal, my concept was always that the mecha essentially rooted itself to the ground and gained defense because of it.  Part of that was I was watching Code Geass a lot when I wrote the actual Mecha and they used metal hooks on a cable offensively and to stablize themselves.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think my sin was assuming that there was one way the Configurations would work rather than keeping things more generic.  The quotes that go along with each Configuration are definitely supposed to assume a particular setting (which is why they indicate a setting...), but as I am rewriting Mecha, I should remove specific implementations of those Configurations and not assume my vision of the way Heavy Metal works is the same as yours.<br/><br/>Does that help?  Either way, thanks for the critique.  Definitely something to looking into.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323388/#Comment_323388" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-07T06:12:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2011  6:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: commondialog</cite>In particular, I think Bulwark would have been better if I had written "Bulwarks become slow so they can pack a deadly punch."<br/></blockquote>\nI read it more as saying "Bulwarks use their movement to help attack", which is what is happening mechanically: Speed points are added to the attack. I guess you are seeing them as sort of being <i>sacrificed</i> to provide the attack, while I get see them as being <i>used directly</i>. In other words, with a head full of <i>BattleTech</i>, I'm having a hard time visualizing what actually happens on the battlefield when "Bulwarks become slow so they can pack a deadly punch." Maybe they stay still so they can shoot better?<br/><br/>Similarly, I picture Heavy Metal as using movement ability for defensive purposes (i.e. dodging), rather than movement being sacrificed to provide defense. Again, same visualization problem in <i>BattleTech</i>.<br/><br/>Also, the min/maxer in me really wants to put these configurations on mechs with high Speed, as they provide more benefit that way. Again, with a head full of <i>BattleTech</i>, this means targeting them on light mechs, which all works great, except that there is some dissonance with the names and flavor of the configurations.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, how often have you seen those configurations used in play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323829/#Comment_323829" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-10T16:47:43+00:00" title="May 10, 2011  4:47PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wordman,<br/><br/>I do see it being a sacrifice.  You are correct.  Let me think about it.  I think the best I can do is separate the flavor text/explanation/description of the Configuration from the implementation.  That way, we both can be right.<br/><br/>I have seen them in play.  The don't get selected often, though I had one player, who used Bulwark frighteningly effectively.  Although, he did cheat a little bit and then rules lawyered that he should be able to cheat.  So suddenly a lot of his opponents seemed to have Defender.  Not necessarily my proudest moment.<br/><br/>To be honest, when I do Mecha Overdrive Edition, which addresses the numerous grammatically issues in Mecha and fixes some of the things Cedric said needed some TLC, I have a strong feeling Bulwark, Hot Shot, Heavy Metal, etc. will not make the cut.  Once you get to Mecha Combat 4 they tend to cause way too many Cutscenes.  If anything, I might make a rule that they don't generate Overdrive at 5 Successes.

For example, say the pilot has linked Armor to Strength. Her mech has some kind of "Versatile Defense" configuration based around the Defense linked trait. She spends a point of Overdrive to activate it. For that turn, she chooses to link Armor to Intelligence (and, therefore, whatever mech stat Intelligence was linked to previously now links to Strength). Later, she activates the configuration again, but this time links Will to Armor.<br/><br/>Gives you similar versatility, but doesn't change the basic math.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324018/#Comment_324018" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T19:41:46+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  7:41PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's not a bad idea Wordman.
