"Independent" in the meaning: not dependent on actually being played, but written to be read as a possible game. As such the game text may be considered a kind of literature which is harboring some extra connotations.<br/><br/>I find that idea intriguing.<br/>__________________________________<br/><br/>* Somalian Children<br/>-the rules:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: trzy worki cementu</cite>Game is divided in turns in which one of the players creates the somalian kid and resolves his/her future.<br/>Player needs to choose name, create thing the kid loves and hope the kid wants to achieve.<br/>Now it's to roll 1d10 and checking with table below:<br/>1 - 3 kid is forced to join children's army and is raped/drugged into submission<br/>4 - 6 kid is forced to prostitute for food and catches HIV<br/>7 - 9 kid dies (choose the way - hunger, bullet, etc.)<br/>10 - roll again and check the the table. If player rolls triple 10 child's story catches interest of foreign journalist or international movie star and is free to fullfil its love and dream.<br/><br/>Roleplay the scene with other players. The acting player gets a role of a child while other players play npcs. If you roll some 10s but didn't reach the triple 10 result incorporate glimmer of hope and survival (which fades away and leaves kid to its own sad fate) into the scene.<br/><br/>In a next turn another player creates another somalian child.<br/><br/>In short: yes, it's a joke.</blockquote>____________________________________<br/><b>Please note:</b><br/>- this is not to start another discussion on Raven or Somalian as such, but to discuss <i>the idea of writing game-texts</i> as a purely literary genre.

The idea is that your text communicates something different simply by presenting the challenge of playing the game as a perspective for the reader to consider, even when in reality the author is delivering his actual message in the act of reading, not the playing (which usually does not come). It's a theoretically valid literary genre, although one with a horribly narrow audience. Like writing limericks about particle physics.

It's not too long, and it has a clear message about something else than narrow-minded rpg theory (the favourite topic of concept game writing) that can be appreciated without commitment to some rpg discussion. The literary strength here comes from the simple fact that the game can be interpreted as a concretization of the odds of living in Somaliland - getting to be happy is like rolling three tens in a row. Punchy and simple.<br/><br/>Of course, it's still an over-complex vignette presented in an odd context. I'd rework this sort of thing into a simple newspaper opinion column - the key message could be condenced into one sentence, something like "The great majority of children in Somaliland will meet an ugly fate, I find it a quite awful place." Formulated like this the piece would be understandable to others aside from roleplayers. A tricky thing, to try to write a concept game that actually is worth the trouble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185638/#Comment_185638" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T18:55:50+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  6:55PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. I sort of backed into something similar with a game I was working on a while back called <i>Nameless/Faceless: Rememberance Day</i>.<br/><br/>I didn't actually set out for it to be a joke or for it to be meaningful exactly. It was more meant as an excersise to teach players not used to using miniatures in their games to treat them as inspriational art for character and story development.<br/><br/>Anyway, the game itself was pretty simple. Using some WW1 plastic army men, the player advanced 3 man "squads" across a board representing No Mans Land, with the goal being to get a certain number in to the enemy trenches by the end of the game. As players moved their squads into the various spaces, they'd flip a card with text on it. The text would call for the player to provide some kind of perosnal info about one of the miniatures in the squad, and then would give some kind of instructions to follow once that info had been provided ( generally representing some kind of battlefield event).<br/><br/>The personal info tended to be something about the character's pre-war life or family or connection or childhood event.<br/><br/>Anyway, given the subject matter, the various characters had about the same chances of survival as the Somali Kids, and the goal line of enemy trenches was mostly an "off-switch" for ending play.<br/><br/>I did try an initial form of the game with Caesar_X, and it turned out fairly poorly, so I went back and created a one-side only version of the game, which also had players basing the names of the minis on people they know or had known.<br/><br/>Now I kinda want to pull it back out and take a second look at it. The expiriment wasn't intended to be a solely teaching game; I'd also thought about making a few rough copies and mailing them to people who wanted to try it out ( about a half dozen sets, since that matched the amount of extra WW1 toy soldiers I had lying around).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185639/#Comment_185639" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T19:27:47+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  7:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick thought: for this sort of literature to be effective, the reader has to be basically literate in roleplaying games (which begs the question, "Which games would be the basis for an RPG 101 class?". That's what I mean by basically literate). So the audience would be as limited as the audience for RPGs, which is to say, more limited than the audience for most literature.

Perhaps that's why the typical concept game concerns itself with roleplaying, specifically.<br/><br/>Also, it seems to me that there is no appreciable difference between a "concept game" and a "game I don't want to play", except for the intentions of the author. Something like RaHoWa (or any other love-to-hate darling of the Internet rpg culture, really) is clearly only consumed as a concept game by the overwhelming majority of the audience, regardless of how the designer planned his game to be enjoyed. This also hints at the negative impression we tend to have of concept games - if you're going to make a game that is not intended for play, then you're probably making a game I'm not interested in playing, and why would I care of your shitty game? It's always annoying and even painful to read some shit that's not playable, and this is ten-fold so when the text hints at or even outright states how the writer is not really serious about making a game, but is just jerking your strings in a manipulative attempt to make a point.<br/><br/>Difficult form, all told. Might be an interesting challenge, and certainly that Somalian Children game is annoying me less than the usual wankery. Could be still improved by removing that joke explanation, proper captioning and whatnot. I'd also rename the game into something that challenges the reader and frames the concept nature more clearly, like "Want to know what life's like in Somaliland?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_185645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185645/#Comment_185645" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T20:22:02+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  8:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 1, 2009 8:25PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>It's always annoying and even painful to read some shit that's not playable, ...</blockquote>I find this idea most interesting if the game you write is highly playable.

If a game is playable and clearly makes you want to play it, then it's not really a concept game anymore - it might be the sort of dysfunctional game that they wrote during the '90s, full of interesting fiction and crappy mechanics, but it's still a game that transmits to the reader a clear and genuine impetus for play. So limiting myself to just games where I'm genuinely left to suspect whether the intent of the designer was to create a playable game at all (that is, a concept game), those were my thoughts on them. It wouldn't cross my mind to categorize a game that I personally felt playable and interesting to play as a concept game.<br/><br/><i>However</i>, I do agree that this notion of defining concept games based on whether they're playable or whether I want to play them is incomplete. "Playable" is a traitorous concept here, as something like Somalian Children is clearly able to be played - what makes it a concept game is that the reader can easily imagine how the game'd go and thus has no need to play it, just like you said. But then, what of somebody who finds the concept interesting and can't quite figure out the whole game without playing it? The whole notion of games-to-be-read is highly subjective, as what is obviously not playable or interesting to one might well be for somebody else. In this way it'd be natural to only call games where the designer intended the game to be merely read "concept games".<br/><br/>Thinking further on the idea of games intended for mere reading, I have to say that the concept games are not the full truth here, or at least the way the term is used normally is somewhat misleading. For instance, I myself have written at times quite many games that were intended only for reading, but I don't think of these as "concept games". For example, let's see if I can find it... ah, yes: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=16440.msg174845#msg174845" rel="nofollow">Werewolf: BUTF-</a> was something I wrote in passing a couple of years ago to roughly sketch out how I'd go about hacking <i>Polaris</i> into a WoD game. This sort of thing happens relatively lot in this culture - or at least, I tend to do this sort of spontaneous sketching. And the thing is, these "games" are most of the time not intended to be seriously played, at least not in the exact form they're offered - they're just sketches to demonstrate something to somebody else. So are these the concept games I have a distaste for? At least there is the difference that a sketch like that tries to be playable (in the wide sense of being meaningful to play, not the narrow sense we discussed above), even if it's not intended to be played.<br/><br/>So thinking of games that have been written to be read rather than played, we have several categories that are pretty different:\n<ul>\n<li>Concept games: games written to prove a point. Usually not playable, or at least not enticing.</li>\n<li>Supplement treadmill games: written as prose for collectors of games. Playable, but not the main purpose.</li>\n<li>Sketch games: written for other designers as part of design dialogue. Borderline-playable, but again not the main purpose. Interesting how I have a strong gut feeling that these are somehow different from the concept game category - I get offended by the concept game's unplayability for some reason; perhaps it's important to me that the sketch game is still pointed firmly towards play, even if it's not written to be immediately utilized for such.</li>\n<li>Awful games: games like FATAL or such might well slide into the category of written-to-be-read if the designer is at all aware of the unlikeliness of the game being played. I cite Sorensen's <i>The Farm</i> here - he must have been aware that the game would be enjoyed primarily as reading material when he wrote it. The game is fully functional and sort of enticing to play, but most probably wouldn't.</li>\n</ul>\nSo yes, there are quite many reasons for writing a game for reading, after all, now that I think of it. Concept games are not the whole truth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185651/#Comment_185651" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T21:43:14+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  9:43PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Am I the only person who immediately thinks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game" rel="nofollow">The Glass-Bead Game</a>?

Why can't it be both playable and a concept-game at the same time?<br/><br/>Any game may be read as a literary text, so it has inherent in it some literary quality. What I am proposing (and to some extent: doing) is writing and reading your games as literature, and look for the special literary qualities of this genre. A obvious way further from this viewpoint, is to experiment with games as solely works of literature, confining your intention with them to that of how they reads.<br/><br/>I consider <i>the possibility for actual gameplay</i> as an important feature in such a text.<br/><br/><b>Daniel:</b> <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> reminds me of the <i>Myth-series</i> of Robert Lynn Asprin. In one of the books (possibly: <i>Myth-marker</i> ) he had a game; "Dragon Poker", as the central premise. The game is never fully described, as the main character is participating in it without ever knowing the ridiculous complex rules. The relevance to the idea of a read-only game is fairly vague though.<br/><br/><b>Matthijs:</b> <i>Nuclear Winter</i> seems like a great joke to me, and a serious message to those believing in a post-nuclear humanity.

Band of Brothers was a recent example, but there are plenty covering different periods. My own choice for WW1 was related to the materials I had on hand, plus a general impression of WW1 as very much a "nameless, faceless" war, especially as relates to the big positional assaults that are so archetypical. <br/><br/>having said that, I geared the cards to stuff I thought was either in-period or nearly universal sorts of experieneces ( which was important to the training experiment). Certainly, Britain's Buddy Brigades from the First World War were an inspiration for the mechanics. Briefly, there was a period when the government there had encouraged organizations like school graduation classes and football clubs to enlist as a group, promising them that they'd all serve together.<br/><br/>Which they did.

Example: when you read Somalian Children you instantly compute the overwhelmingly bad odds for any character in the game, which you combine with the violent suggestions of the text ... and based on that you make a fiction. The fiction is actually a product of the system in the game. Very simple, of course, but still ...<br/><br/>So I'm proposing a kind of role-playing games that actually are to be "played", but not in the normal sense of it. I apologize for not recognizing this before now. Thanks to you for leading me there, Jason and Johnstone!

You already have these structures in your mind that have been constructed through experience and interaction. You can then reference them, for example: "solitary imagined space is the new story-cunts!" You need certain structures in your mind to understand that comment (this thread, s-g, the story-cunts comment, SIS and maybe its context in Forge theory, etc).<br/><br/>By playing games, you create structures of play inside your mind, based on all the gaming you have done. If you only play one style (say old-school D&amp;D with various ad-hoc house rules and a strong GM into pixel bitching who is still vulnerable to persuasion) then that's the only imaginary stucture of gaming you have in your mind, and you'll probably get all wigged out if you sit down to play the Shab al-Hiri Roach or Polaris with some dirty hippies (because there's no GM, players narrate and have to conform to rules instead of vice versa, and there's scene framing), because the game will be totally at-odds with the mental structure you have for "roleplaying games." The same thing happens if you try to read the Roach (for example) instead of playing it. And if the text is supposed to be a commentary (like Somalian Children), rather than a game you should spend more time playing than actually reading (the Roach), the commentary is lost on you.<br/><br/>But if you have the right structure in your mind, you can read a rules text and, step-by-step, create an imaginary version of the game being played out - which is the only way for the text to be fully effective <i>as a literary text.</i> And that's the same process as other references ie slang, jargon, in-jokes, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_185868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185868/#Comment_185868" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-04T04:59:02+00:00" title="January  4, 2009  4:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2009 5:10AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>So you're talking about a sort of "solitary imagined space" instead of a "shared imagined space"?</blockquote>We've talked about "shared imagined space" before, and you know my stance; that the "imaginary space", or fiction, is a unique product in each and every players head.There is no such thing as a "shared imagined space" (at least not in the popular sense of it). The thing we share in a role-playing game is the <i>interactive </i>space, by which the fiction is created. In the case of concept games like the ones we are discussing here, meant to be played out in the mind of the reader (for sooth solitary games, ja); we are still looking at an immersion in an interactive system, and this system is the basis for the <i>fiction </i>we create in the theatre of our mind.<br/><br/>In my view there are three layers in rpg's. I name them thus:<br/><br/><b>Vision</b><br/>- the gamesmith making an interactive system, or a group freeforming one, usually represented by a game-book.<br/><br/><b>Interaction</b><br/>- the player/s immersing themselves in the interactive system ... ah, and the GM is a player too, actually.<br/><br/><b>Fiction</b><br/>- the final product, the narrative created in the mind of the player as he/she indulges in the interaction.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bad Johnstone</cite>You already have these structures in your mind that have been constructed through experience and interaction.</blockquote>Quite so! All people have these references (games of lets pretend, boardgames, computergames and whatnot). So everybody are equipped to read such texts. As long as the text tap into the ordinary references of everyday people (that is: the text is not too rpg-specific in it's terminology) it will be effective as a literary text.

I never played it, but it was a very good read for an old designer like me, due to the inherent qualities of the design and the strong rules-prose. So it has made an impression (and I would very much like to play it, but I rarely GM other games than my own).<br/><br/><i>Dogs </i>is certainly not meant as a read-only game.

Playable? Sure, sort of, if you like a system that doesn't quite work and utterly freeform trait design and a ridiculous lethality index. Intended to be played? I kinda doubt it, though I'm sure some do (or at least try). Mainly intended for RPGers who would get all the "inside jokes?" Almost certainly.<br/><br/>"Awful" or "crap" or "irritation-inducing?" Only if you've got some kind of weird bug up your ass about humor that takes the piss out of you (a bit, if only by association).<br/><br/>So where's <a href="http://davidartman.com/games/for-mature-audiences" rel="nofollow">FMA</a> in this continuum of "concept games?" Yes, it was written mainly to try--literally--a 'proof of concept': that one could have an RPG that broke every major convention of RPGs. Playable? Well, barring some procedural tweaks that would make for more structured, less freeform play, sure it is. WOULD someone play it? I have serious doubts, mainly because it demands one make oneself more vulnerable than most folks are likely to do for entertainment. So is it an "awful" game because of that last point; is it a "concept game" because of the first point? Its text certainly doesn't "have a point" like <i>Somalian Children</i>'s does--quite the opposite, as it's really intended to be playable and it DOESN'T force a scenario, situation, theme, or play agenda by default (except maybe a bit of NAR). It's point, if any, is that you can take this RPG and go anywhere with it that you need to go, to resolve (or at least become aware of and explore) real personal issues.<br/><br/>This thread is interesting; but I fear another terms debate is boiling up, when it began with a very workable premise: can we write possibly playable games which, nevertheless, are in fact intended to convey a message or make the reader think of something that has nothing to do with actually playing the game (in their own minds or not)? I believe it's a fruitful genre to explore--and it could definitely be a subset of "RPG poems" that have cropped up lately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186303/#Comment_186303" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T12:32:45+00:00" title="January  6, 2009 12:32PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought of another "concepty" game element--original <i>Traveller</i>'s character generation.

I like it a lot.  I think that Raven's artistic value is as a deconstruction of an existing form, namely the RPG rulebook.  The floweriness of the prose clashes works against the leaden but descriptive writing in most RPGs, the abstract concepts of the rules work against the mundane bean-counting abstractness of most RPGs and the subject matter which feels more like a demented kind of group therapy also works against the genre concerns of most RPGs.<br/><br/>So I like it, I think you're very clever and you should be proud of what you've accomplished.<br/><br/>However, I'm not sure of the extent to which this is literature.  On one level it could be presented as a kind of heavily structural prose poem but I think the form is probably more similar to something like Warhol's Campbell's Soup Can; it's elevating something to the level of art that is not widely considered to be art.

Role-playing games may, as all other art-forms, be both art and craft and entertainment at the same time. Some works are all of these, and some works exist solely within the confines of art, or entertainment, or handycraft.<br/><br/><i>Sidenote: although I have worked professionally within the classical paradigm of rpg's for more than a decade now, I consider myself an artist as much as an "entertainment manufacturer" (not meant to be derogatory). I do indeed make entertainment, yes, when working with my classical fantasy rpg <i>Fabula</i>. But at the same time I am designing games meant to go deeper, to challenge the players in other ways. I have no other label for this than "art" (I do not love that label, as I am always interested in presenting my games to people with an art-interest varying from enormous to plainly negative).</i><br/><br/>My foraging into the field of read-only rpgs are one of my more "arty" ventures, and as such your words on <i>Raven </i>hits bulls-eye.<br/><br/>So, after reading this game, Jonathan: do you still think that games outside of play have no value at all?

I have a real problem with people buying games to read instead of play because I think it tends to distort the market for people who care about actually playing games.  It also pisses me off as a book critic as some people would rather read Transhuman Space without playing it than read contemporary SF.  I do think that games are things meant to be played but I do recognise that some people buy game texts purely in order to read them and if that type of thing is going to happen then as long as the waters are not muddied (and the fact that you're open about Raven being written to be read) then I would rather see games like Raven being produced than gmes like Exalted.<br/><br/>  I look at Raven and I can see the art and the intelligence that goes into it and I can understand someone wanting to read more of that kind of thing.  This is not generally true of sourcebooks for mainstream games.<br/><br/>  Purely out of interest, have you considered pitching such a game to one of the more experimental fiction venues?  I can imagine a journal such as GUD might be geeky enough but out there enough to really appreciate something like Raven.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186575/#Comment_186575" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:35:05+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 10:35AM by misuba.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are people aware of "Agony," the game text that appeared in excerpt in the September 2006 "games issue" of the <a href="http://www.believermag.com/" rel="nofollow">Believer</a>?

Other than technical manuals (in all their forms, from "How To" books to IT manuals), no other "genre" of writing does that. What does that buy us? I'd say it brings a sort of formalism and pacing: aside from authorial voice and varied diction, they are going to give a sort of "march" feel to the work. Maybe even meditative, as the pace is felt and matched by the reader.<br/><br/>They also tend to present information in referential manners, be they summaries of procedures, or just your typical charts and graphs of laundry lists of shit. This referential format strips out every nuance, dictional curlicue, and "voice" to present the bare facts. In that way, they can be like the "HALT!" shouted by a drill sergeant, to continue to (ab)use my marching metaphor--the cadence breaks as we rattle off a list of terms or numbers or both, like presenting arms. Compare that to, say, those statistics list one reads that convey a message, e.g. (stats not real, but close):<br/>* Billions spent on heart disease research in 2007: 45<br/>* Number of American death from heart disease in 2007: 500,000<br/>* Billions spent fighting terrorism in 2007: 300<br/>* Number of American deaths from terrorism in 2007: 16<br/><br/>The point is made crystal clear (above: our government spending priorities are FUCKED), but with nary a jot of expression or style. Editorialized by the timing and choice of what is listed, not by the tone or mood conveyed in the writing of the list.<br/><br/>I'll stop there, for now, to see if I'm spring-boarding the right way (or hieing off into the trees). For obvious reason, I won't bother to address "game fiction" or "setting fiction" at this point, as it uses all the same devices of a novel or short story, and that's of minimal interest to me (mainly because there's already a HUGE body of work that addresses how to do those forms). Readability, I'd say, falls into the same camp: a readable game text has the same qualities as a readable magazine article, novel, or biography. Clarity, diction, etc (or the opposite, if you're going all deconstructive on us). Become a decent writer--poetry, prose, manuals, whatever--and you will be a good game writer.\n<blockquote><b>- And measured against "ordinary" literature:</b><br/>Is it possible that a games-format is a stronger read than say; a novel, in certain aspects?<br/>Could a book of game-texts be as good a read as any collection of short stories?</blockquote>\nStronger? hard to say--what's the point, what's the theme, what's the message? Every format suits some deliveries more than others. I want to woo a woman, a poem is going to go better than an 800-page novel. I want to explore a nuanced and complex theme, through the agency of several interrelated characters? I'm at the least going novella.<br/><br/>As for the second question, I'm going to go cheap and just say, "Sure." Particularly with game text of the type you're most suggesting: the RPG Poems With A Message. Time and tastes play a big part in that, though: a book of fan fic shorts about Star Wars will probably bore me FAR more than some witty, thought-provoking, or saddening RPG Poems that hit me square between the eyes with issues current and near and dear to me.<br/><br/>So, really, the better (or more interesting to me) question is what things can RPG Poems do BETTER than existing formats; and I believe I begin to explore that above, by unpacking a bit what an RPG format is and what that does to the reader's expectations and reading behavior. And, as I said above, I'd like to be sure we want to go there before I do that heavy lifting--being a game writer AND editor AND technical writer, I can go into a fair bit of depth about atonality, neutral (AKA common) diction, procedural presentation and structure, projecting attitudes, and "writing between the lines." Hell, you'd be amazed at the sort of shit a Major Corporation has me do, to "write around" flaws of design without admitting them--that's, basically, the exact tack, flipped, that <i>Somalian Children</i> takes.<br/><br/>(Sorry so long, but that's what you get for intriguing me.)<br/>[edited for clarity and ccorrections]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186668/#Comment_186668" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T15:21:59+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  3:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 3:23PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First out: David; this is pure gold to me!

KINDA busy, today, but I'll get us started.<br/><br/><b>Baseline writing and what's left unsaid</b><br/>So I'm going to write a "LitRPG" (I need a shorthand). I can approach it like <i>Somalian Children</i>, with an essentially neutral tone--no rants, reads like a tech manual--and let its very starkness carry my meaning. Here's a chart, roll your d10s, consult the chart to see your fate. BUT, if you know anything about math, you see that you've got a 1:1000 chance of surviving--that's not said in the text, that's left for you to realize. And the realization of the unsaid carries the message and theme and impact. Now you can re-read and the whole tone is changed; the cynicism just drips off the page. HOW? The text hasn't changed. The tone is still there, sill consistent and neutral. But now, having "got it," you can imagine the author staring balefully at you, accusingly, his voice so flat he sounds like the dead. Becasue isn't that the REAL point: what have YOU done to help these poor children? Isn't that the takeaway message, the unsaid?<br/><br/><b>Projecting attitude</b><br/>That neutral tone, however, needn't be the whole bag... in fact, more and more "RPG texts" are conveying a strong authorial diction and style, moving away from (and even mocking) the neutral tone of a tech manual. So our LitRPG can take that tack, and present a seeming "game," but with an editorialized voice that shows it's clearly not meant to be played and, rather, is meant to carry a message or cause a change of thought. I'll bring up HoL, here, as an easy and obvious example of this (IMO). Yeah, sure, the game is somewhat playable, with a lot of rule repair and addition (or a freeform-loving play group), but it's REALLY suppose to be a screed. It's a punk zine disguised as a game which (it seems) takes the piss out of all the "structure" of gaming--could they be one of the first "system doesn't matter" writers? Are they trying to say, "look, just have fun and fuck the details," or are they actually MOCKING those gamers or that gaming culture which get so buried in stat and crunch that they get twenty minutes of WOW for every four hours of play? (Sound familiar? HoL authors as first Forrgites?!?) Or am I bringing my own experiences into the mix; am *I* the one projecting meaning and attitude onto the book? For the record, I'd say no in this case: I read HoL when it came out, WAY before exposure to all this theory, and I still saw it as taking the piss out of many contemporary RPG systems. But another LitRPG could well work with ambiguity, leaving each reader to project onto it their own interpretation and intent, just as much poetry does.<br/><br/><b>Atonality</b><br/>So above we have the two poles of a tonal continuum: writing between the lines and bitch-slapping with editorializing. But there's a third path, an orthogonal axis: one can use shifts in tone in a LitRPG to really hammer a point. If I have you lulled into the meditative march of neutral tone procedural writing and then, WHAM, start off on a screed about how this fucking chart is WORTHLESS if you don't have a heart to care about the children, you fucking DICK!<br/><br/>Well, you sort of snap to attention, no? Where did all THAT come from, what did I just miss? Is this guy schitzo? Etcetera. You, as a reader, have to engage different mental gears to address this shift in tone... and then engage still more when I drop back into a staid and steady, neutral tone again. Done poorly, this atonality will seem like Tourette's Syndrome (just as bad atonal music sounds like folks in different rooms, tuning up or adjusting their synthesizers). Done properly, it can underscore the moments of consistency AND convey a message, via contrasting tone, with the moments of insanity (just as the completion of an atonal music progression can make all the disjointed notes attain a sort of "metaharmony").<br/><br/><b>Structure</b><br/>This one is the big one, because for all the talk of tone, it's the order of presentation which carries at least half the weight. In a typical RPG, we often see a color piece, to establish the mood of play for the game, followed quickly by a series of definitional sections, so that one isn't totally lost as to what to do when the procedural stuff starts using the game jargon. Suppose that was tossed out the door? Suppose an RPG was written like <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, with immediate total immersion in a nearly thoroughly different language? What is said, by that? One has to read it twice, just to get the sense--or jump to the glossary in the back of some editions, to try to get a baseline. A LitRPG can do the same thing, by eschewing the standard structure of a typical RPG.<br/><br/>But what is said by FOLLOWING the typical RPG structure: intro, define terms, establish character, present procedures of play, flesh out setting (again, fiction or reference material or monster lists or whatever). That goes back to tone and diction: is it homage or satire? Or is the fact that it's hard to answer that question part of the exploration of the LitRPG?<br/><br/>Or, rather than eliminating common structure or following it to convey additional meaning, what about a disjointed structure? Cart before the horse stuff--all the procedures of play presented before you even know if you are a character or in author stance or what; absolutely no information about setting in the presentation of what is clearly NOT a generic system? Can a LtRPG carry surprises, nestled in the sequence of presentation, just like a novel can use flashback to clarify what was, prior to the flash, a very ambiguous or downright confusing scene? What is meant when such structure conventions are violated? A whole branch of "LitRPG Theory" can grow out of just the considerations of structure and how it informs the piece, just has been done with conventional (and, moreso, experimental) literature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186799/#Comment_186799" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T08:22:37+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  8:22AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Damn, a BIT too long....)<br/><br/>Anyhow, just another nudge--that's why it's mostly questions and not a list of rules.

Three tones, each with a functional role in the text, but none of which is intended to layer on nuance of the overall book's INTENT... because it's only real "intent" is to teach you to play a game the way the author envisioned it. EVEN IF proper gameplay enables the underlying intent of a game to educate or inspire (think <i>Grey Ranks</i>, here).<br/><br/>But using atonality in a LitRPG would (should? could?) drive at the message, at the theme, at the takeaway of reading the text itself, without ever engaging in whatever "rules" or "procedures" are presented as carriers for that message.<br/><br/>OK, 'nuff for now.
