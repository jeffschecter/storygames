I stopped in at the gaming room on the off chance that the steampunk game I'd signed on for as an alternate might actually have a space for me. Lo and behold, it did. And boy-o-boy, am I glad it did! I had more fun than I've had in a long time at a pickup game!<br/>\nThis is a game that is available free online at www.onesevendesign.com. The world is very like a steampunk version of Serenity: you ship, the Owl, is a smuggler's vessel outfitted with a Tri-Valve Reciprocal Steam Drive. There are 5 pregen characters with options to set up some additional ones as needed. The game begins in media res with the crew of the Owl having been captured by the Imperial Cruiser Hand of Sorrow. Lady Blackird, incognito, with her ex-slave pit-fighter companion Naomi Bishop had hired the Owl to take her away from an arranged marriage to meet up with her ex-lover, the Pirate King. Can they escape from the Hand of Sorrow before the ship's captain discovers the crew's identities? Will they be able to locate the secret route through the deadly asteroid field of the Remnants? Is Lady Blackbird just trying to hook up with her former squeeze, or is there something more sinister afoot? The best part of this game is that YOU get to decide!<br/>\nLOVED this game and downloaded it as soon as I got back from Necro. I'll be presenting it to my gaming group for those days when some of us can't be present, or for between games. I'll even offer to GM - and you have NO idea how radical a concept THAT is!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298182/#Comment_298182" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T10:13:07+00:00" title="October 25, 2010 10:13AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Varina, I'm so happy you had a good time playing and you really dig Lady Blackbird.
