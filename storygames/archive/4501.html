Left to my own devices, I chose some games I feel comfortable with and a totally new one.<br/><br/>I've run Primetime Adventures enough times that I feel comfortable just sitting down at a table and doing a single episode for a con session.  I've played Shab Al Hiri Roach a couple of times and enough of it is figure-it-out-on-the-fly that I don't feel like I need to do any prep.<br/><br/>But then there's Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>I've had the book for a while.  I've read it, gotten the gist, but I've never, ever played it or run it before.<br/><br/>And so, like a fool, I listed it as one of the games I'd like to run. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What sold me on the game was the character creation, which sounds like a blast -- but does one have enough time to run a complete session of creating characters and having an adventure in a single four-hour timeslot?  And if I go with character creation as listed in the book, it seems to me that adventures need to link to the PC's Aspects and the enemies they've made in their Novels.  Which means that pre-planning pretty much goes out the window.<br/><br/>Can SotC be run as a con session?  What needs to be kept and what needs to be jettisoned?  Should I be creating pre-generated characters?  Semi-generated characters, which start with a general outline, but leave the players to fill in the details?  For the later, I was thinking of making one for each Character Idea listed in the book, giving them Stunts and some Skills but not Aspects.<br/><br/>There also seems enough crunchiness to the combat and social rules that I think I might be getting over my head, constantly looking up rules, etc.<br/><br/>Basically, my question comes down to: does SotC work for cons?  And if it doesn't work out-of-the-box, what do I need to do to make it work?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>-d-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101964/#Comment_101964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-09T10:48:55+00:00" title="October  9, 2007 10:48AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Daniel,<br/>See you at Philcon!  <br/>I've been pretty happy running SOTC at conventions or local meetups.  In most cases, I've used pre-generated characters, fully written up.  Using pre-generated character does three positive things:  it ensures the characters are tied to the starting situation of the adventure; it ensures the characters are tied together via Aspects (since the GM writes the Aspects); it allows the GM to plan some Compels (wheter accepted or not).  I recognize what you lose is the collaborative energy of character creation, but you potentially gain a more cohesive character set that helps the adventure.<br/><br/>The one time I've ran SOTC as a purely pick-up game with the full character creation process, two of the four player characters wound up well integrated.  The other two much less so.  The reason for this was that we didn't start off by defining the setting better.  Pulp means different things to different people:  Horror Tales, Weird Science, Spicy Tales, etc.  The lessons I took from that were: 1) jointly establish and agree to the setting within the pulp genre for the game; and 2) reinforce the benefit of Aspects linking the characters.<br/><br/>Once past the decision on full character creation, pregens, or something in between, there are a couple of mechanics that I've used (having read of many of them on various actual play threads):<br/>Allow multiple free tags in a roll.<br/>Use the 2/4/6 rule in place of standard consequences (described in this  <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3677" rel="nofollow">earlier thread</a>, which has other SOTC advice, although you may have to choose from various suggestions.)<br/><br/>A couple of lessons learned from the times I've ran SOTC--The first time I ran it, I went a little overboard with the situation and backstory--lots of options and lots of red herrings, but it was too much.  There wasn't enough room for the PCs to add details about the clues around them.  From that experience I learned to keep it simple.  Leave plenty of room for player character 'declarations' to impact the story--either tactically, like in a fight; or strategically, with regards to 'what's going on.'  Second, and this is pretty much right out of the book, start with an action scene--something is happening that may be threatening to the characters, like a fight or a flood; or it may simply require the characters to act, like a race or a debate.    <br/><br/>Sign me up for your game! <br/><br/>Mel White                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
