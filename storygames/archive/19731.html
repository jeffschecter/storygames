The game is supposed to work with any RPG system, but I've written examples for the Apocalypse World system.<br/><br/>The game is conceptually done, but I'd still like some more input. Take a look at the intro text and the tables - let me know what you think.<br/><br/><b>REBEL WORLD<br/><br/>Introduction</b><br/>One hundred years from now, a warlike and dreaded alien race has declared war on planet Earth, and the human race must fight for its existence. The invasion of Earth is well underway. Her cities are burning and humanity\u2019s fighting chance is dwindling by the minute. The human race has been decimated by interplanetary bombardment and alien ground forces. Humanity\u2019s future is bleak, and hope is hard to come by.<br/><br/>But a few people haven\u2019t given up yet. They fight the invaders with everything they have. From the few cities that still stand to the rubble and dust of those that have fallen, the human rebellion is rising. Their goal is simple but almost impossible to imagine: To overthrow the aliens and drive them away from Earth. To destroy every single enemy that stands in the way of a free human race. <br/><br/>Rebel World is about humanity\u2019s last chance for survival. It\u2019s about a desperate resistance trying to fight a technologically and militarily superior invasion force while surviving the dangers of an apocalyptic world. The war was lost long ago. Earth is now an occupied planet; humanity is on the brink of extinction, and the player characters are smack in the middle of it. <br/><br/><b>Rules</b><br/>Rebel World is based on the basic Apocalypse World rules and is more of an extension than an actual hack. The rules in this book allow your group to create a unique alien invasion: The aliens can be created randomly using tables or the group can go free-form and focus on the aspects they prefer. Each table entry has a corresponding Threat Move list for the MC to use.<br/><br/>There are seven tables with six entries, each having a major impact on how the game is played. Each entry has a number of MC moves that allows the MC to challenge the players according to what they\u2019ve chosen for the invasion force. There are no restrictions, however; the MC can choose any move he wishes from any entry as long as it makes sense contextually.<br/><br/>)example tables)<br/><br/><b>1. Alien Traits</b><br/>Are the aliens swarm-like?<br/>Are the aliens humanoid?<br/>Do the aliens use technological implants??<br/>Are they physically superior to humans?<br/>Are they mentally superior to humans?<br/>Do they have psychic abilities?<br/><br/><b>Humanity table: MC Moves</b><br/><br/> <b>Humanity</b><br/>Do people live in occupied cities?<br/>Do some people live a normal life under alien rule?<br/>Are there unprotected refugee trails?<br/>Does the resistance hold its own or is it constant retreat?<br/>Do human traitors play a role?<br/>Do humans have alien technology?<br/><br/><br/><b>1. If humans live in occupied cities, use these MC moves:</b><br/>Portray these humans as scared and desperate<br/>Describe the city as being on the brink of destruction; buildings have been turned to rubble and roads are blocked by broken cars and other objects<br/>Let the players meet human resistance cells<br/>Have the group help resistance cells in surprise attacks in urban environments <br/>Show desperation by having the humans attack the group for supplies<br/>Introduce humans who will snitch on the group for food and resources<br/><br/><b>2. If humans live under alien rule, use these MC moves:</b><br/>Portray people working for the aliens as fearful and intimidated<br/>Make them difficult to recruit for the resistance<br/>Show the players how these people live in luxury in contrast to the squalor of the holds<br/>Offer the group opportunities to go undercover as workers to get into alien facilities<br/>Make the aliens ruthless if there is the slightest infraction or suspicion of treachery<br/><br/><b>3. If there are unprotected refugee trails:</b><br/>Make the aliens merciless killers of refugees<br/>Let the players see horrific scenes of refugee camps after they\u2019ve been destroyed<br/>Demonstrate alien ruthlessness by having resistance exexcuted publicly as examples to others<br/>Have NPCs with connections to the PCs in threatened refugee camps<br/>Show alien groups looking explicitly for unprotected refugees<br/>Depict the refugees as desperate, starving and destitute<br/><br/><b>4. If the human resistance fighters hold their own against the aliens:</b><br/>Depict holds as fortresses that can hold off enemy attacks<br/>Introduce leaders of the resistance who are strategically successful and inspire hope<br/>Give the PCs extra equipment, weapons and food<br/>Include the PCs in a major battles against the aliens and let their actions matter<br/>Let the resistance celebrate a victory, then introduce a major blowback<br/><br/><b>5. If human traitors play an important role, use these moves:</b><br/>Create an atmosphere of untrust<br/>Let suspicions run amok<br/>Reveal resistance fighters\u2019 plans to the aliens<br/>Let the aliens attack when the group thinks it\u2019s completely safe<br/>Depict killings and executions of both suspected and guilty human traitors<br/><br/><b>6. If the aliens use control devices, use these moves:</b><br/>Move controlled humans into holds with hidden explosives<br/>Let controlled humans suddenly turn on friendlies<br/>Create confusion by letting a controlled human run interference<br/>Introduce a person wearing a control device that is faulty<br/><br/><b>7. If the human resistance has access to alien technology, use these moves:</b><br/>Make the alien technology hard but not impossible to use<br/>Create holds that focus on picking apart alien technology for human use<br/>Let the PCs use alien weapons in a limited fashion<br/>Have alien tech blow up when least expected<br/>Introduce scientists who need certain alien tech in order to build defensive devices<br/><br/><br/>There's more, but I would like to see if anyone's interested.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437986/#Comment_437986" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-31T00:25:20+00:00" title="August 31, 2014 12:25AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            interested and curious :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wingsofwax" title="wingsofwax"><img alt="wingsofwax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wingsofwax">wingsofwax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437987/#Comment_437987" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-31T01:36:26+00:00" title="August 31, 2014  1:36AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2014 1:37AM by wingsofwax.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>interested and curious :-)</blockquote>\nThanks!<br/><br/>I've released the Google Doc to everyone so you can get a better impression of the game.
