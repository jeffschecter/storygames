Scenes are played in two phases.<br/>Phase 1: "Moving forward the Narration" (Player A narrates scenes 1, 3, 5. Player B narrates scenes 2, 4, 6). Phase 1 ends when the player says "Scene End".<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-2.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-2.png</a><br/><br/>Phase 2: "Fighting for my character". This is the 'fighting' phase in which the players try to force truth of fictional elements through playing statements. This is the phase when Pride, Prejudice and Token values are used (and are affected by the winning and the losing of one statement with respect the other).<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-3.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-3.png</a><br/><br/>But is better understood with one example:<br/>PRIDE in Action<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-4.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-4.png</a><br/><br/>PREJUDICE in Action<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-5.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OP-5.png</a><br/><br/>At the end of Scene 6, Phase 2 the final scene is played.<br/>This basically happens with Player A and B<br/>- Narrating their desired ending (ending must respect all fictional constraints determined by previous scenes)<br/>- Rolling 1 die + Pride and Prejudice values + token (x2)<br/>The highest result wins.<br/><br/>The game lasts around 60 minutes.<br/>It is possible to reduce playing time around 20 minutes reducing scenes (and modifying a bit the currency mechanic).<br/>I'm going to write in the next few days the final version of the manual (ready for editing and publishing purposes).<br/><br/>Thanks for any feedback.<br/>Rob                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438101/#Comment_438101" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-04T04:44:07+00:00" title="September  4, 2014  4:44AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all.

What kind of feedback have you received so far?</blockquote>\nYes, the game design last around two years, and it's been played a lot before the publishing.<br/>The feedback received is that the game asks for a great imagination effort at the beginning because it provides no guide to start the fiction and the players begin with a blank sheet of paper.<br/>During the game, if players do not control properly all the events narration may lead to a very complex "fiction structure" that may have the risk to be potentially impossible to "tie together".<br/>Both aspects are intended, because my design style tends to emphasize the aspect that the player has the most possible narration authority but everything is said builds 'fictional constraints'. Having the most possible freedom imply more responsibilities... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438269/#Comment_438269" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-11T14:26:31+00:00" title="September 11, 2014  2:26PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game is published on Lulu.<br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/roberto-grassi/pride-and-prejudice-a-narration-game/hardcover/product-21755169.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/shop/roberto-grassi/pride-and-prejudice-a-narration-game/hardcover/product-21755169.html</a><br/>Hi all.<br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
