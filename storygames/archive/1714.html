<p>In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1703&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> Ross asked,</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Lucy, can you 'splain me what about TS made you create Shock, also can you name other specific games that you see Shock as a reaction to?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sure, Ricky. I'll tell you a story.</p>
<p>A few years back, I was plowing though homebrew after homebrew trying to get a system that I liked. I'd been using a system called Hero Factor where there was a protagonometer of sorts to obviate whiff factor (it wasn't that great). Then I was using a FUDGE hack. I wanted to do something with freelance diplomats, a la Schismatrix, and I wanted it to be a gnarly, near-future setting. At just that moment, Transhuman Space was released. It was eerie. So I picked it up and thumbed through it. Sure enough, Transhuman Space is a big pile of ideas taken from my favorite books, most notably the Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson and a bunch of Bruce Sterling novels. "Just what I need!" I thought.</p>
<p>So I started running my campaign about these new graduates from the diplomatic academy on Olympus Mons (the other two campuses being in Bangladesh and in Earth orbit). They dealt with gnarly stuff â€” slavery was a frequent theme â€” and a good time was had. But I noticed something strange: the players stopped spending their XP. That meant to me that the characters were as well-defined as they could be, and the success:failure rate was perfectly acceptable to them. So the reward system wasn't firing at all. And, as so often happens, the outstanding moments of the game weren't covered by the rules at all; they hinged on everyone magically jamming on the same idea. A slaver was sold by the PCs on Ebay due to the same loophole that made slavery legal. An asteroid of Quaker mushroom farmers was threatened by a self-important bounty hunter with a salvaged railgun. Alien contact was made in the ocean of Europa (a colonial, bioluminescent bacteria that formed a planetwide intelligence when a problem required an intelligent solution, then turned back into single-celled homogeneity when the problem was over. The problem at the time was "humans"). And all the dice could say about any of these things were a) how badly you got hurt in a fight (of which there were mercifully few â€” everyone was clear that shooting made people dead, and it was not only morally questionable, but tactically as well, to start shooting) and b) whether you failed your diplomacy checks. Naturally, this problem persists throughout SF (or any thematic) games played with GURPS .</p>
<p>Here's what I wanted: diplomacy is a matter of carrot and stick, but the value of that carrot and that stick was up to me, the GM, which is a superlame position to be in. I wanted rules for the players to be able to manipulate the NPCs in the situation. I didn't want to know if they succeeded or failed in manipulating the situation; I wanted to know how complicated things got. I wanted them to <em>always</em> be manipulating toward their own ends, and failed rolls just slowed the pace. And I wanted, most of all, for there to be real, visceral reactions to the situations in the game. I wanted to threaten the crap out of those characters and have the players come back for a second helping. I could threaten the characters, but that made me a dick; if the characters were hurt, it reduced the players input into the game, and that sucked. I wanted the players to be able to stake their characters' well-being on stuff they believed in. Naturally, they wouldn't, because if they did and lost, it meant they wouldn't get a chance to do it again.</p>
<p>My experience was similar with Cyberpunk: I wanted the game to be about a governing system not bound by law and the ragtag individuals who used its own tools against it. What we got was guns and a bunch of untopplable corporations.</p>
<p>Paranoia works well because part of the thematic content is the whiff factor and deprotagonization of the main characters. It makes it funny. So it was a positive influence.</p>
<p>So I knew what I wanted: a game that gave the punch of a Sterling or Robinson story, where nothing wasteful is done by the players. Where the protagonists do protagonizing stuff, where you can beat the crap out of those characters when it's appropriate, and where the setting is built and changed by the players so that it develops the richness I really like in my SF, and I think others do, too.</p>
<p>Edit:<br/>
I just found <a href="http://blog.empyree.org/?2005/06/15/1494-feedback-from-transhuman-space" rel="nofollow">this</a> page about ThS while checking the date of publication. It has this interesting tidbit:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>David Latapie: The lastest generation of AI, the (SAI-10, is as smart as a average baseline human. Granted, augmented humans like Pandoras or Metanoia are consistently smarter than baseline. Still, a race had begun. It seems the first half (if not the first quarter) of the 22nd century could see a reversal in the hierarchy between analogic and digital creatures. Maybe the first Singularity.</p>
<p>David Pulver: This is the source of much tension in the setting.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That's good stuff! That addresses racism, slavery, and the human condition! Now, does a Pariah disad really cover that? Shit, I want to see situations where this is a boiling, festering pot of discontent and the issues are between humans and AIs. There's a potential for tension, but what the system needs is <em>pressure</em>. A game that takes on ThS issues should take place in a poor, Fourth Wave country where the humans can't afford augmentation but can afford pirated SAI slaves, who aren't real happy about all that. Have some players as slaves, others as masters. See what gets said. But let's see, of the books I've got, they're about: The most advanced nations; Planetary surveys; Earth orbit; Underwater; Deep space; and Memetic technology. These are all color and don't really contribute to pressure. I wanted a system that would guarantee that pressure.</p>

                            Wow.  That's a stunning post, Joshua.  I kinda wish a whole bunch of indie designers would write similar posts about the type of play they wanted to experience, why it wasn't happening, and the moment when they decided, "Hey, I'm gonna write a game that does this better."  I think we all share that same journey, to one extent or another.                        </div>

<p>Thanks, Jonathan.</p>
<p>Yeah. I've gotten a lot of shit for saying that I think that certain games fail on some level or another, but that's why we make things: because we don't have what we want. In this case, my homebrews, GURPS, FUDGE, and whatever else, weren't giving it to me because they didn't have it to give.</p>

                            Joshua, I ran an identical game, with an almost identical system, and got identical results.  So, it's not purely anecdotal evidence.  We had a good time overall, but man, I had to work my ass off as the GM.  I'd really like to give Shock: a try one of these days...                        </div>

                            You may have hit upon an important law of economics!  Unfortunately, I am on a student's budget in Manhattan, and ownership of Shock: may not strongly correlate with the playing of Shock:.  Nonetheless, some economists are hopeful that both of these difficulties will be remedied in a month or two.<br/>
<br/>
I was using Alternity, heavily modded for the technology of Bruce Sterling's terrific novel <i>Schismatrix</i>.  Like you, I ended up running a game that involved a lot of political negotiations, and yet the key parts were largely fiat, since I was the one who decided if the NPC was persuaded or not, and what the consequences might be.  Things improved enormously (from my perspective) once we started using the system for Conflict Resolution, but even then it was clunky from a mechanical point of view.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't to say we didn't have a good time.  I think all of the players enjoyed RP-ing their characters, we often had really imaginative set-pieces, the last third of the campaign had an awesome, fairly open plot, and the ending was fabulous:<br/>
<br/>
A radical Shaper (read: eugenics) government infects the solar system with a 'horizontal gene-transfer' virus, essentially replacing genetic transmission through sex by genetic infection through touching.  This would ultimately lead to the elimination of genetic identity, and thereby destroy the Shaperist ideology--and hand victory over to the Mechanist AI's.  In effect--the human race would cease to exist in any meaningful term, as individuals would be gene-shifting creatures owned by rigid, compassionless AI's.  The only alternative was an interplanetary war, which was already beginning.<br/>
<br/>
The players confronted the creators of the conspiracy, who had been harassing their characters non-stop through 3 years of the campaign.  They <i>hated</i> these bastards, and for good reason.  But, once they understood the conspiracy's purpose, they thought about it for a little bit... and then decided, "It's better than war.  Can we help?"  (Yes, we ripped off Alan Moore.  There are worse crimes.)<br/>
<br/>
Still: it would probably have been better with Shock:                        </div>
