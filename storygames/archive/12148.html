It's going to be held in July. From Wednesday night, July 7th to Sunday afternoon, July 11th. The convention is going to be in Morristown New Jersey, at the Hyatt.<br/><br/>We would really love for you to be part of the Explosion this year.  If you'd like to run events, we need your information by June 1, if at all possible.<br/><br/>Over the last two years we've been handling the event submissions on the Indie Games Explosion Wiki.  But this past Dreamation, some events did not upload when they should have and we nearly lost events.  For that reason, and because the Wiki has been hacked in the past, we're using Google Docs to handle submissions this time. We'll see if this works better.<br/><br/>If you want to run games, we need you to send an e-mail to <a href="mailto://indiegamesexplosion@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">this address</a>.<br/><br/>Tell us how many games you want to run. Kat will then send you an email link to your own Google document, one document per event you wish to run. Then just fill out the linked document with all the usual stuff: title of game, blurb, etc.<br/><br/>Aside from yourself, Kat and I will be the only ones who can access this document.  You will not need to make a Google account to use the document. All you'll need to do is follow the link and fill out the document. As soon as you do, we'll update the <a href="http://igewiki.ipressgames.com/pmwiki.php?n=Dexcon13.Chart" rel="nofollow">IGE Event Chart</a> with your games.<br/><br/>Do not worry about a minimum of events or running the same event a minimum number of times. Those restrictions were repealed.  Just plan on running what you are going to have the most fun with.<br/><br/>We're looking forward to having fun at DEXCON, hope to see you there!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272827/#Comment_272827" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-24T13:20:24+00:00" title="May 24, 2010  1:20PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2010 1:21PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted my game proposals on the private link Michael talks about. Figured I might as well share it here:<br/><br/>Friday, July 9, 8 pm: More Human Than Human: The corporation made you to be laborers, sex workers, and military monstrosities. You\u2019ve broken out, but you\u2019re property. How will you and your friends break free to live the way you choose?<br/><br/>Saturday, July 10, 2 pm: Love Is No Sin: The weird alien monk that took you from your family said that you were special. Said that you would remake the galaxy. And yeah, you learned a bunch of cool things, gained unimaginable powers, but the twisted old freaks say love is the path to evil. You and your friends feel different.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Shared information for both games:<br/><br/><i>Misspent Youth</i> is about friendship, rebellion, and kicking ass. In the game, you play 12- to 17-year-old kids in a future world screwed-up beyond recognition by The Authority. The Authority is a villain that you create together at the start of the series, played (in this case) by the game's creator, Robert Bohl. So much fun, the fun-meter chip implanted in you at birth will go off, and the Morality Police will come looking for you.<br/><br/><b>Minimum/maximum:</b> 3/4<br/><b>materials provided?</b> Yes<br/><b>experience</b> None<br/><b>mood</b> Fun or serious<br/><b>age limit</b> 12+ with parents' permission, otherwise 18+<br/><b>has this game been run before, how often and where.</b> This system has been run dozens of times at Double Exposure events.

But at DexCon, there's a better chance I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272959/#Comment_272959" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-25T08:37:06+00:00" title="May 25, 2010  8:37AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't submitted my events quite yet, because we need to schedule kidcare, but DexCon is the official release of Blowback.
