It's not the best of games to run over the 'net due to the sheer multitude of rolls and checking to see who does what, so it took three 3-hour sessions on different days to finish a single dungeon. It was fun, even if somewhat irritating at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started the game as a kind of spur-of-the-moment type thing, with me just making up a general idea for a "intro dungeon" that was mostly about getting familiar with the game's mechanics. It did not end up that way, with one PC (Hardcase, bullet to the brain) dying and two others barely escaping with their lives (psyched Crasher with a mangled arm and leg and Hustler in critical condition that last for three turns... They both had been on fire for a little while, as well) and a single for-sale weapon (which was enough to cover their expenses still! Anything gun+1, which was what they lifted, is both powerful and Expensive, I decided). Oh, and Steve the intern went critical trying to get out, too - and that was the last we heard of him. It was a shame! Everybody liked Steve, the helpful intern who caught incediary grenades in his hand. All the deadliness is partly due to me being making some bad judgement calls (giving a hobo a magnum... A Gun+1 basically has a 19/100 chance to instakill the other guy every time it hits), misremebering to call in armor a few times, and partly due to the PCs just gallivating around and ignoring my multiple ominous "Okay, you can do that, but it'll take a moderate time and give me +1 THREAT to spend" sayings... We're all now more knowledgeable and it likely won't happen again. But! In my defense, it's completelly non-obvious just from a glance what exactly a particular damage roll <i>means</i>, and there's way too much little bits to handle for me to be able to remember everything... Even the players, who have a vested interest in keeping track of their own armor score, didn't catch up to this (partly because "Treat When Animals Attack as Brawling" is buried somewhere that you don't immediatelly see or remember to take into account when skimming through those range / damage / employee handbooks).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway! We started with them making characters and spending Hiring Points, which took a fair bit of time (there was a lot of "what do you think we should do with this Hiring Point?.." and double-checking with the other players.) but was fun enough. We also had them pick a name... They grumbled - neither of them actually liked thinking of names, but after a short bit, we had a suggestion - General Organization for Resource Extraction, or GORE for short. As per the instructions in the game book, I took that name and made it worse - they were now the General Organization For Extracting Resources, or GOFER for short. We had a short laugh, decided on the equipment for the Hardcase and Hustler, and had them go to the City Park. Here, I chose to show them just how poor and useless their mother corporation was, having them choose between taking a bus and hoofin' it. They chose to hoof it... Exhaustion rolls for everyone. Hustler and Steve get winded and rest up a bit, being lectured by the Hardcase all the while.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Dungeon itself... I never told the players, but it was basically a 3x3 square. The rightmost column was mostly open, and the park got thicker and thornier the more to the left one would go (which the never did). The park was full of: 1) fruit that you could harvest in the top row; 2) wild animals the skins of which you could sell; 3) a few rare benches that could be ripped apart and sold for scrap; 4-5) A few bigger loot stashes that the players never came around to. There was also a completelly adlibbed hobo-hole, which was small and cramped and heavily trapped and had an armed hobo in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter their initial rest period, they encountered a pack of wild dogs, which the Hardcase scared off with just a stare. Then they searched for useful things and found some fruit trees on the far end of the park and a hobo hole closer to the entrance. They descended into the hobo hole after having the intern do some initial scouting, woke up the hobo. The Hardcase tried scaring him into submission, but got shot in the head and died there and then instead. The Hustler dived behind cover, then slithered his way to the hobo and started slashing at him with his razorblade (suckerpunch'd him thrice!, and then some regular hits). The hobo eventually got harrowed and tried to run away... Triggered his own trap, and got knocked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had the Hardcase's player roll up a new character then and add him to the team - a Crasher. The two characters divvied up the loot (mostly from the dead Hardcase) at took a short booze break, tying up the hobo there and then. The hobo somehow got loose eventually and tried to run, only to be run down by the Crasher... He tried to trade a secret for the team to spare his life, but the Hustler was having none of it and just stabbed him in the heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon the Crasher insistence, they decided to do something a bit more extreme than gathering fruit, so they sought and found some animals they could skin - a fox and a bear. The Crasher went for the bear's guts, while the Hustler just stood back and watched for most of the time. Since a bear is a bit more than just a critter, I gave him three wound boxes (one of each), and it took three turns to kill him... Which was enough for the bear (When Animals Attack+1) to maul the Crasher arm and leg. They finally killed it, though... In fact, they killed the bear together, rolling an equal number on their HIT roll at a point where any extra damage would've dropped the beast dead. The Hustler shot the bear in the ear and the Crasher punched him in the face with brass knuckles. Cue general boasting and accusations of kill-stealing!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy then, I had enough enough THREAT accumulated to bring a monster in, and the players had just given me an opportunity on a silver platter. And thus, the forest shakes and the trees tremble and out comes... a unicorn! Oh wait no, it's actually a Giant Albino Elk Prince of City Park, going all "WHO DARES KILL MY SWORN VASSAL?" Cue general blame-dodging and blame-shifting!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rivalry didn't last more than a few moments, though - the Hustler chose to do his Spiel on the Giant Albino Elk Prince of City Park (the hobo killed the bear and we have avenged his death!), and it worked! That would have been pretty good, but then the Hustler decided to push his luck, and tried to suckerpunch the Giant Albino Elk Prince of City Park with the SMG he looted off the Hardcase (note: Suckerpunch should probably only work with weapons one is proficient with)... And scored a 19, which was enough to kill him outright. Exhilaration! Festivites! "DUDE, THAT WAS SO COOL!"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I activate the "Rise Again" ability. The bullet pops out of the wound, which then miraculously heals itself. There's a semblance of panic, but they calm down and hatch up a plan - the Hustler taunts the Giant Albino Elk while running away, the Crasher (who is hero'd and psyched up by that time) circles it and tries to burn it to the death an incediary grenade (taken off of the Hardcase, again). The Crasher botches the roll, and suddenly, everyone's on fire!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hustler goes critical while the monster charges toward him, but the Crasher swoops down there faster and makes a break for it. Even while burdened, the fact that he's going at fast+1 really helps, and a couple dozen of dramatic Endure rolls for everyone (will the Hustler die? Will the Crasher buckle down on his broken leg and arm?), they break away from the Giant Albino Prince of City Park... Who then calls in reinforcements, a pack of vicious hummingbirds, and then the both of the characters get a few more minor wounds as a parting present as they rush through the City Park exit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt which point I remind them that their Company does not have any sort of transportation at all. Damn!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Crasher then tries to do something he saw on House once, and tries to stabilize the dying Hustler... By using knives as scalpels, scotch as disinfectant, and his own shoelaces to tie it all together. And instead connects the Hustler's street armor to his chest, with surgical precision. Accidental Injury, another Severe wound!<br/>\n<br/>\nBy that point I felt like I've tortured the characters enough, if not too much - not wanting them to die after they've technically left the dungeon, I give them the chance of a cab ride to the hospital in exchange for a Cheap, which they take. And the dungeon is done! Blame is apportioned (Hustler shifts it to the dead Hardcase), things are sold (or rather, *a* thing is sold), things are kept, wages are paid, experience is gained (everyone picks extra ENDURE, the Hustler also picks proficiency with SMGs), all while the two of them lie in hospital beds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of lessons I learned and also a couple of general observations about the game, but that will have to wait for another time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280134/#Comment_280134" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-12T13:14:01+00:00" title="July 12, 2010  1:14PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap that was nuts. I gotta say that I've been very surprised so far by players' decisions in this game. I consider this a good thing, that they readall this junk I wrote out and see completely different stuff in it than I do.<br><br>And, yeah, gun+1 is supposed to be some hardcore shit. Guns are the deadliest weapons anyway, and when you add a bonus it gets really nasty really quick.<br><br>Although, really, all the deadly weapons are in fact quite deadly, especially in the hands of someone skilled at using them (a Tank with a big weapon, a Carver with an edged weapon, a Maddog wtih a nasty weapon, etc.). Armor turns out to be really important -- otherwise people go critical or die really fast. Which I like -- that's the effect I was looking for, the vibe I wanted those rules to create: <i>Weapons hurt! Armor is your friend! Combat might really get you killed!</i> The corollary to this, which not many players have seemed to pick up on yet, is that, whenever possible, you avoid direct combat in order to harm foes in other ways.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DWeird</cite>The Crasher then tries to do something he saw on House once, and tries to stabilize the dying Hustler...
