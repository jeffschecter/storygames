I'm missing a few cogs entirely for this machine as well. <br/><br/>The outset of the idea is the impending doom of a village. Something bad is coming. And through play, you set out to discover what that bad thing is. Because the outset is vague, this is tending more to a system than a specific setting, though I'm thinking that, to get things started, I'll set out from a concrete example and see if it translates. <br/><br/><i>There might be a common or setting specific intro to set up the mood, the angst. Strange things have been happening: birds falling from the skies, geysers popping up where they weren't before, mysterious illnesses, etc. These give a prompt to start the investigations, and introduce a pretext to something Bad.</i><br/><br/>My system idea would consist of <i>rumors</i>. These are randomized elements that come into play, one per scene. How these take form? Right now I'm thinking of abstract doodles on cards, that could be interpreted as the player sees fit. It's about discovering the BigBadThing, and it's your BigBadThing. So you draw a couple of rumor cards, play out a scene of how you go out to investigate some trail, to find out about some rumors. <br/><br/>The next step is turning rumors into truths. It's a group storytelling activity, so to balance power within, I'd like to have a mechanism that when one player creates a rumor, the other players get to decide whether it's a truth or not. What's critical here, is that you can't go about denying every rumor: I need a pacing mechanism. There has to be pressure to find out about the BigBadThing, cause it's coming, and the sooner you know, the sooner you could act. Then again, I don't want players to game the system and accept everything for a sure win. That being said, the game is about discovery, not about beating a big monster (though it could be); but you might as well all perish in the end. <br/><br/>On the one hand, the BigBadThing will be very much on the foreground of the tale. It drives all other characters in a sense. But it shouldn't be centre stage. Each character will have a different motivation for going after it, perhaps even conflicting. The BBT will change the characters. Perhaps the quiet fisherman wants revenge above all, whilst another character needs the BBT alive to cure some illness, learn of his past (who said the BBT needs to be a brainless monster?),... <br/><br/>I<b>n order to advance, I tried to answer the big three:</b><br/><br/>1. What is your game about?<br/>It\u2019s about the coming of doom and destruction. Everyone knows that it is coming, but no one really knows what it is. The characters each have a motivation to go after the source. As players play, they discover the true nature of coming event. Potentially, they\u2019ll be able to stop it. The game offers a structure that can be applied to different genres, but the main aspect is the same: doom is coming, weave the story of what or why and resolve your character\u2019s quest along the way. <br/><br/>2. What do the characters do?<br/>The characters get riled up by recent events. They each have a motivation to go after the source of the mysterious happenings. They set out to find information, coming across snippets at a time in the form of rumors. These rumors will lead them to the truth. In the end, they will discover the BBT. They will then need to decide how to face it, if they can at all. <br/><br/>3. What do the players do?<br/>Players first build a character. The character is chosen according to a role plus a motivation. Players proceed to draw rumor cards. The rumor cards give indications on what the BBT might be. Players play out scenes of how their character comes about this information, and they are free to interpret it. Scenes can play out as monologues if the characters are alone, or as dialogues if other players are present. <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Thoughts, help, sources I should read on design, etc, all are welcome <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424780/#Comment_424780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T12:42:32+00:00" title="November 25, 2013 12:42PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say: playtest it. Then you will see what you would need. You already got a spine, and the cards can be written by all the participants before you start. Be sure to decide on themes when you write the cards. What kind of rumors are you thinking of?<br/><br/>I would first decide a theme for the village and create characters from that. I would probably myself not limit myself to a village, but a group of people. A guild, a family and so on.<br/><br/>Are the secrets known by everybody? It's easier if people know about them. They can still be revealed under the cause of the game, but no player should hold any information because that can create blockage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kronik" title="kronik"><img alt="kronik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kronik">kronik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424788/#Comment_424788" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T14:48:47+00:00" title="November 25, 2013  2:48PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, the village is too narrow for the other stuff I had in mind. I was thinking that the main gist should be applicable to any situation, affecting a group of people. The BBT could be a physical beast, or a natural disaster, or maybe something mystical? Perhaps it's more mundane, but therefore no less terrifying: an abusive relative, and a family who has a hard time talking about it directly. I'm not sure if it'll stretch that far, but just to illustrate. <br/><br/>I'm also unsure if all rumors would work in all settings, but I guess that depends on the players. I don't know how much to spoon feed and how much to leave in the open. An example: three eyes could be a beast with three eyes, or perhaps it's the tattoo local gang members all have, or the "third eye" might be the name of a drug. I'm looking for rather open-ended clues like that, which is, admittedly, a very hard part. <br/><br/>By secrets I guess you mean the motivations? Yeah they should be open to get the drama rolling from the start. <br/><br/>For character creation I had a quick&amp;dirty setup:<br/><br/>Build your community by chosing roles from the following list.<br/>- Fixer: Good with his hands. Might be a craftsman or a smithy, a magician or a hacker. <br/>- Broker: Uses words to get his way. The town leader, a politician, a sales rep or conjurer. <br/>- Brains: Smarter than the average cat. Scientist, shaman or alchemist, swindler or mastermind.<br/>- Brawn: Brute force. A warrior, builder, security.<br/>- ...<br/><br/>I feel kinda scared to put something so unfinished in front of my friends.... I was hoping I'd get more done at my desk before dragging them into it, but I guess you're right: I'll only see what it needs if I confront people with it. <br/><br/>Thanks a lot for commenting Rickard, really appreciate it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424802/#Comment_424802" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T18:44:06+00:00" title="November 25, 2013  6:44PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really interesting concept.  I think having interesting rumors is the hardest part of what you're considering.  They need to be vague but full of flavor.  Players could create them on their own, but it wouldn't be very fun to interpret your own, and then you have the concern about consistency of tone.  I love the idea of the players having to assemble all the rumors they hear, weed out the dross and figure out what is threatening their community. Maybe have rotating spotlight scenes to start, where three or four players play the town and interpret something for the spotlight player.  That player then takes their impression and in the second phase gets together and talks about what she learned in the first phase and see where things intersect.<br/><br/>I am sort of reminded of one of my favorite Game Chef entries from last year, Coyotes in Dark Alleyways.

Consistent, vague but evocative, that's what they need to be. Though drawings might be replaced with words, or phrases, which are more concrete, but can still require interpretation. <br/>I like the idea of rotating spotlight. My first inclination was to have a GM be town leader, and players would report back to him. But I like GM-less stuff for storytelling, everyone being on the same foot and all. Reporting back could be like a council hearing. <br/>Thanks for the reference, I've been on the lookout for similar things to learn from!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">@Simonpaulburley</a><br/>Some kind of currency seems like a logical step. I like that you can earn currency. It would be nice if there's a tough choice between advancing a satsifying story and your character's personal outcome. Like a blind bid on rumors: the council votes with black or white tokens. Someone receives said tokens... at the end of the game, your character's destiny is decided by the majority of whatever color you have. If everyone starts with one of each, then they could only ever vote down one rumor for each they vote up. Perhaps tokens according to player count. And X truths leads to the next phase (confrontation or somesuch). Good stuff Simon, thanks!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a><br/>I'll check out these links! Awesome!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Simonpaulburley">@Simonpaulburley</a> 2<br/>1) As above, I think a simple vote would suffice and keep the story flowing towards its conclusion. If it's not true, then it would bring about a sidebranch that is potentially not constructive. I think. I want players attention to be at 1) the character's relationships/hardships/discovery and 2) uncovering the BBT<br/><br/>2) Like you said, coherence above all. I'm thinking Fiasco-like tables would also work and bypass the need for cards if it would be text-based. For images, cards of course. <br/><br/>3) I'd love to have lots of people want to buy all sorts of settings packs <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> But yeah, first things first: a single setting in mind, and make a game from there. <br/><br/>4) That's a very solid comment. I'll have to take that to mind with the rumors (can they all work together?), I was thinking of making the truths a kind of timer. When you've established X truths, you move on to the next phase. <br/>Could be that you get an equal number of tokens depending on the number of rumors (=spotlight scenes). 8 rumors (2spotlights per player in a 4 player game) = 8 tokens (4 white, 4 black per person). Each rumor you put in one token. The truths will vary, but you'll always be between a certain number and I think you can't approve or disprove all of them this way. Can someone smarter than me comment on the potential outcomes? <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">@Tore_V</a><br/>When I heard about Kingdom, I put my idea aside cause I thought Kingdom would fill that gap <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> I haven't read it yet (shame on me, I know), but I'll have to soon if it's steering too much in that direction. The Quiet Year I know little about, except for that it's "that drawing game". And compared to AP: I want to do away with stats and skillrolls. I just want storytelling. I'll admit AP has part of "let's play to find out about the world", which is close, but I'd like to focus on "let's find out about the bad thing coming": the danger is closer at hand. I don't envisage this as a campaign thing either, just a one shot. <br/><br/>-- <br/>Thanks to all of you for commenting.
