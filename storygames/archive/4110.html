Its old territory, I think, but hey, it might be worth some thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are levels of what is considered by players in any game to be "attackable" territory of their characters.  By "attackable" I mean that another player, either by fiat or by mechanics, can force you to acknowledge something about your character.  Typically, people would rank things in roughly this order, from least contentious to most:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Character's passive behaviour (i.e. when the Ogre bashes me, do I get thrown backwards or stand my ground?)<br/>\n2) Character's active, ancillary behaviour (i.e. when I bash the Ogre, do I do it in a flashy way, spinning around, or do I do the two hand over head whack thing?)<br/>\n3) Character's active, meaningful behaviour (i.e. do I bash the Ogre or the orc?)<br/>\n4) Character's speech (i.e. does my character say "Have at you, ogre!" or simply grit his teeth?)<br/>\n5) Character's observable state (i.e. Does my character look afraid, or angry, at the ogre?)<br/>\n6) Character's internal emotions (i.e. Is my character REALLY afraid of the ogre, or not?)<br/>\n7) Character's internal beliefs (i.e. Does my character hate ogres?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not a complete list, and the ranking may not be perfect for everyone (I especially find people vary greatly regarding where they would rank level 4) but it will serve. Think about the following sets of conflict goals I might have, from my opponent, the barmaid's, perspective, as attacks on different levels:<br/>\n<br/>\n* I kiss the barmaid (level 1)<br/>\n* I kiss the barmaid, and she embraces me in the process (level 2)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to kiss me (level 3)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to tell me she loves me (level 4)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid all flustered with my flirtation (level 5)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to fall in love with me (level 6)<br/>\n* I get the barmaid to feel I am the only one in the world for her (level 7)<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player has a line on the chart above below which they will not accept any attacks, and also a line on the chart below which they will accept attacks, as long as there is some sufficient method in the game rules to defend themselves.  It can vary somewhat by game: I accept fiat attacks down to level 4 or even lower on my character in Capes, but would never do so in D&amp;D.  It can vary by the exact nature of the "attack": I might have no problem with "the Barmaid gets me to fall in love with her" (level 6), but a big problem with "the Barmaid gets me to fall in love with the Evil Mastermind" (level 6).   It varies also with WHO is making the attack: some people that I play with I implicitly trust to make attacks at all levels against me, because I KNOW they will make it awesome in the story, while others I don't.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the main point I am making.  <br/>\nIn any game...<br/>\n    but especially in a story game that allows for attacks at levels lower than 2 (which is almost a definition of story games)...<br/>\n        and even more especially in such a story game if you are playing with strangers...<br/>\n           and most especially if you are in a story game with strangers who have not played in a game that allows those sorts of attacks before...<br/>\nit is vital that you have a discussion of the chart above or something similar and where people draw their lines in that moment.  This is because if a player finds attacks below a certain level unacceptable, it WILL NOT MATTER that the mechanics of the game allow you to make attacks on those levels.  You will just be pissing that person off.  Having this discussion up front, and being very explicit about it, you can avoid a world of unpleasantness.  You give players a chance to: agree to keeping attacks above a certain level; walking away from a game that doesn't really interest them; or explicitly agreeing to have their boundaries stretched by a new experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure this seems like common sense to most of you, but I bring this up because I have experienced recently several instances of game play where disagreements or misunderstandings regarding the above have led to unpleasantness of a trivial to significant nature.  I won't bother filling up space with examples, but can provide them if there is interest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92111/#Comment_92111" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T08:58:09+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  8:58AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the chart.

At the same time, I have a "mechanics" issue when some abilities "always miss vs PC's", which is the default preference of most of those I game with.  I think this is indeed one of those early game contract discussions.<br/><br/>My problem is when I find too many players <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> playing themselves as convinced of something against their best judgement, seduced when they think it's a bad idea, "letting the wrong word slip while kissing persuasive lips".  Not all players are alike on this point ~ though the ones I encounter prepared to play their characters as sometimes foolish etc. tend to be ones who are the ones who have played newer systems.  I myself am fine having it played that my character is fooled by something I know is untrue, as long as it was resolved by the system (if I wanted a hard to fool character I would build one just as I build a hard to hit character) or my choice (I recently chose to be fooled by another PC because it sets up a much more interesting situation if he at least gets his scheme off the ground behind by back).   I'm fine with scenario's that result in changes to character since really to me that is the core "situation" to explore in a game (who is this character) and if there's no upredictability, no change, and nothing to improve, then it's pretty boring.  Am I prejudiced against dwarves?  Let's roll! (that was an actual stakes being settled in an early scene playing one character, I "lost" and was convinced I was wrong in my views of them).<br/><br/>Even if it's not "submitted to the system", I still prefer to at least see players asking "well, how good was that social roll, hmm...." and then playing "what their character would do" against that good a social skill roll I would be satisfied.  What I see instead is "how good they are is irrelevant, my guy's decision is unchanged".  That seems to go with players who develop characters that themselves do not change over time in their beliefs etc.<br/><br/>I suspect systems like Spirit of the Century's Aspects which allow players to "get a currency" for "giving into a flaw" convert over players into playing characters with a line drawn further down the chart.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92378/#Comment_92378" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T20:10:40+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  8:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 31, 2007 8:17PM by jzn.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the chart.

I can understand feeling like you are cheating if you aren't using all of your NPC's resources against the players, but it's for the best. If the game was full out PvP between the GM and PCs it would be kind of lopsided, what with the lightning bolts, tornados, earthquakes and such that the DM has at his disposal in most GMed games.

In my experience, it is 6-7 that are considered sacrosanct, and 5 darn close to sacrosanct in so far as it is so closely tied to 6-7 (how can you look scared without actually being scared?)  <br/><br/>In my own GMing, I find that a cut between 3 and 4 is often the safest when playing with a group of people that don't know each other well and may not be used to playing a game that CAN hit levels 4-7, as long as there is a discussion before hand.  Typically, the way I frame this is that social interaction cannot be "mind control" but it can be "behaviour control"; you can make a character behave in certain ways through social interaction, but you cannot dictate levels 5-7 about that character.  As an example, I may have an NPC force a PC to give the NPC the keys to the safe using intimidation, but I cannot specify the reason the PC is doing so; only the player can specify the reason.  The player can choose to play the PC as defiant, terrified, cunningly silent, or whatever, as long as they hand over the keys.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cydmab</cite>Perhaps this is because I have a very strong causal image of characters. motivation -&gt; emotion -&gt; thought -&gt; action.

I actually view it as something that can go either direction, as witnessed by my preferred mode, above, with people I don't know well and who don't know me well.

Looking at myself, I find this is usually the way I play ANY character, not just NPC's as a GM.  I always think "what should HAPPEN right now" and then back fill the motivations to make that thing occur.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>I should have added, per Ron Edwards' comments (can't recall where exactly, Forge or I would knife fight a man), that I think the "saw off" that's acceptable is that any change in behaviour of a player character that is induced by rule mechanics/system is "short term". </blockquote>\nThis is perceptive.  "My character makes your character love him forever" is a lot harder to take then "My character makes your character love him until such time as it makes sense to you that the condition should stop."  <br/><br/>We had a conversation about this in the context of In a Wicked Age, the other night.  The reason that trust between players is so important in a game like In a Wicked Age is that almost all the real consequences of what happens are wholly narrative.  I stab your character in the throat.  Now, for the rest of the session, or iuntil it makes sense otherwise, you are going to have to narrate your character as having been stabbed in the throat.  You character is still up and kicking, it still has dice to roll, etc...its just been stabbed in the throat.  Trust is important because I am trusting you to play your throat-stabbed character in a way that takes the whole throat stabbing into account.  If you narrate your character bouncing up and fit as fiddle, with a little blood on his chin, I'm going to feel, well, cheated.  However, if you figure out a cool way to narrate AROUND the whole throat-stabbing, I'm NOT going to feel cheated; I might say "curses, foiled again", or "cool, I never would have thought of that!", but I won't be angry that you have weaseled out of the consequences of our conflict.  So I can make a challenge "your character will love my character", and it will work out fine, because that will last for as long as it MAKES SENSE that it should last, because you and I trust each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92826/#Comment_92826" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T15:30:11+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  3:30PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans</cite><br/><br/>Cydmab, it is interesting to me that you view this as strictly causal.

That is, if action implies thought implies emotion implies motivation, then someone who controls the actions of my character implicitly has a fair amount of control over thoughts (thoughts are limited to the subset of thoughts that would follow from that action); if the causal direction is thought -&gt; action, then someone with control over action also has a fair amount of control over thoughts (thoughts are restricted to the subset of thoughts that would bring about that action) <br/><br/>So what matters is how "Tight" the connections are; that is how many, say, thoughts I feel are reasonable for any given action. If I think the set is small (or equivalently, I can only come up with a small set on the fly to choose from) then my control over the thoughts of the character will be highly circumscribed given someone else's control over action. If the connections are "loose" or not there at all (any thought can be associated with any action... "I love you, therefore I must torture you; I must torture you, therefore I love you") then there's no problem. <br/><br/>But then... there's may also be no ORDERING. I could control actions and motivation, someone else can control thoughts and emotions, and that would be about as reasonable as vice versa or any other combination. So in such a case the claim of this thread, that there is an ascending order of intrusion, might not apply.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92849/#Comment_92849" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T20:40:35+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  8:40PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big [expletive referring to female genitalia deleted] when it comes to this. As I recently realized, I'm pretty keen on retaining full authority over as many features of my character as possible. That's not to say I don't enjoy playing games where the identity of PCs are downplayed in favour of their representation as a collection of skills, or games like Universalis or Dirty Secrets where you share control of a pool of characters, but in games where every player has control of a single character I tend to naturally drift into immersion (actor stance). When in that immersive state, it really bothers me when other players dictate facts about my character which do not correspond to my own vision.<br/><br/>But yes, there is a big difference between\n<blockquote>You lost 13 hit points to the dark knight's swipe? OK, then "The dark knight slashes you across the throat, opening a large gash. You clutch at the wound but blood seeps between your fingers, soaking your tunic."</blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote>You lost 13 hit points to the dark knight's swipe? OK, then "The dark knight slashes you across the throat, opening a large gash. Wide-eyed, you clutch at the wound in panic, blood seeping between your fingers as you collapse to your knees in surprise."</blockquote>\nI can handle the first in a D&amp;D-style game, but the second would bother me. I guess I'm somewhere between 4 and 5 there? I probably would have a bigger problem with someone speaking for my character than thinking (narrating silent monologue) for my character. And in an ideal world, I would rather be given the ability to interpret the situation myself.<br/><br/>I would also be royally peeved if my character was narrated into a mechanically different state - for example, in the example above, if I were forced to take the next round to stand up from kneeling position to continue fighting even though the rules just said "you lost 13 hit points - your move".<br/><br/>One of the design goals of <i>'Til Death</i> is to transfer as much authority over PC narration into the hands of the player as is humanly possible, using a group voting system (in the current iteration, at least) to resolve any major transgressions of social contract. It does this (I think) by providing a set of hints in the process and outcome of skill checking to tell the group if the task succeeded, at what magnitude it succeeded (or didn't) and what character elements were involved. The hints can be interpreted however the player chooses, without the interpretation having any great effect on the mechanics of the game. In fact, this is my greatest revelation in the last little while - the less a narrative decision affects mechanics, the greater the level of authority players can be given over it without it negatively impacting the social dynamics of the group. Seems stupidly obvious, huh?<br/><br/>That design goal was initially mostly included for purposes of combating trad "fear mechanics" which in my experience is blocking more than exciting, and frequently  bleed into the realm of ridiculously trite, but it expanded to permeate the whole system. We'll see how it turns out in the end, I suppose. I guess we're all really designing for ourselves first, eh?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92850/#Comment_92850" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T20:48:13+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  8:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2007 8:51PM by lachek.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and by the way, Hans - "behaviour control" rather than "mind control" is very close to what I'm talking about.

At that point, it's entirely up to the players to determine the hows and whys and the wherefores.<br/><br/>Naturally, a player could determine that "his overwhelming presence enthralls me, making me madly and deeply in love with him forever" is a valid response to a "his Charm beat your Self-confidence with two successes" result.

The main focus of the thread is what should happen if a player character is seduced or is forced to promise to do something later in the story. I don't know if that's the thread Valvorik mentioned earlier in this thread, but there Ron puts forward the idea that limiting a conflict's consequences to the present scene solves a lot of the problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it strikes a fine balance between giving the seducer (in a seduction example) the pleasure of success, while retaining the free will of the seduced. It's easier to play seduced or tricked in a scene if you're allowed to shrug it off in the next and do whatever you want with your character. The seduced can keep playing seduced if that's what the player wants, but is allowed to break free if that's where the player wants to go with the character.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Jonas                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93042/#Comment_93042" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T17:55:00+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  5:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 5:58PM by Valvorik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonas, yup that was the thread I was speaking of and I think it is a good compromise.<br><br>In terms of this forum, and story games being ones where there is a <i>"gaming experience with a lesser focus on My Character and a greater focus on Our Story</i>", I think in such games players should be willing to not be "method actors".

Burning Wheel for example lets the Duel of Wits social mechanic lead to compromises the players can guide, and gives the players other opportunities to guide story and influence its contents (e.g., in that case with Beliefs etc.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93063/#Comment_93063" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T19:20:31+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  7:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 7:20PM by Deliverator.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>Burning Wheel for example lets the Duel of Wits social mechanic lead to compromises the players can guide, and gives the players other opportunities to guide story and influence its contents (e.g., in that case with Beliefs etc.)</blockquote>\nI was going to talk about BW in this thread, so I'm glad someone else brought it up first.  In my opinion, the more important aspect of Duel of Wits, in terms of solving the types of problems discussed in this thread, is that you can never* be forced to accept the stakes, if you as a player are really sure that "my character would never agree to that."  The thing is, since you might win the DoW and get what you want, the system dangles a cookie in front of you if you're willing to take the risk.  But if you don't like the stakes, don't accept them.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*The exception here is in Burning Empires, with mind-raping psychologists who *can* simply go in and fuck with your character's most sacred Beliefs, and there's very little a non-psychologist can do about ti.  But not all BE games have to include psychologists, if there are players in the group who would be uncomfortable with that happening to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93068/#Comment_93068" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T20:08:35+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  8:08PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm comfortable using DoW as an attempt to beat someone in argument, intimidate them into backing down, be wittier, snub them socially, etc.  None of these happen on the interior, they all happen on the exterior, in the social milieu.  I've been out-argued by people who were good debaters, but I usually walked away feeling frustrated that I didn't make my point better, not thinking they were correct.<br/><br/>One of the things I find bothersome about seduction or the like working despite my character's will is that I don't think things work that way in the real world.  I don't think people easily change their minds about issues that are important to them, or surrender their wills due to an hour's conversation.  Change happens over time, because of many factors.  That's one of the problems with using a single set of mechanics for both social and physical behavior.  Physics is a lot more certain (and sudden) than psychology.

That is, the worst cases of railroading are those where the GM simply plays your character to get what they need. Taking away all player authority in play. If one has been through such, I can see how defensive reactions would rise up due to that. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause, again, doing this "right" is possible at any level. So is doing it wrong. One could argue that a wound taken is level 1. But what if you cut off my male character's genitalia as the result of an injury from the mechanics? Might that make the character less attractive to play to some players? I think that people have become sensitized to the "higher levels" here mostly because that's where they've been abused in play in the past. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all about having the ability to play the character you want to play. Without that, where's the fun? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why, I'm guessing, no matter how much we assure people that we empower them to select their failure outputs in contests to avoid results that are to them implausible or which would make the character unplayably uninteresting, people keep coming back to that nightmare situation. I mean, take Joe's example... yeah, if you find a seduction short term implausible, but a long term one plausible, have that be the contest (or series of contests, or whatever works in the system in question). Assuming you're actually interested in the potential that the character in question seduces your character. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean... let's say that I declared a contest to see if a goat could seduce your character. What would you say? You'd say that I was crazy, right? How could a goat seduce my character? So you as a player have, in every game, a expectation of reasonableness to any contest. Let's say that I proposed a contest to see if a snail could outrun you? Huh? Even if there are mechanics that one could use here, the notion is simply absurd. It really doesn't matter if it's a physical or mental contest, you can always just say no. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, will it be more likely that you will have a disagreement over something like the plausibility of a seduction attempt? Sure. It's definitely more likely that the GM will have a female character attempt to seduce your character, who you think would just not be seduced by said party. But this is why we advocate empowering the player somehow to say no - like in the BW example given above. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95187/#Comment_95187" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:34:53+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:34PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>At the risk of sounding elitist yet again today, I wonder to what extent Alan, your reticence and that of others has been due to "abuse" by GM's in the past.</blockquote>\nThats funny, because when I jumped into the "player input" and Grimm/SotC discussions, I was wondering the same thing about folks expressing such extreme skepticism about GM judgment in adjudicating player performance. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But to spell out my background, I GM much more than I play.

Pushing for the change too soon can sap some of the experience sometimes. If I'm playing a very principled cop character in a gritty, nasty city, there's going to be a certain amount of witnessing the baser nature of people I'll need to do before my principles start to erode away. If I'm in a longer-form game, I may want that to take time, highlight the slow degredation, etc. Not have things be at 11 all the time, to borrow from another thread.<br/><br/>If that's the case, when you, my angsty partner, is trying to convince me to just kill a perp rather than expend the effort to take him in, there's a point at which I might say that isn't up for grabs, because as a player, I don't buy it yet, even if I acknowledge that we're traveling down that road story-wise. So it's not even at that point like I'm trying to "protect" my character, as much as I find it lame that he'd make a big change like that so quickly. <br/><br/>But on the other hand, if we're in a one-shot... hey, why not? Got to squeeze all the drama we can out of those hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95807/#Comment_95807" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T02:51:50+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  2:51AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2007 3:27AM by John_Harper.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good example, Lenny, and it helps me further explain where I'm coming from.

My fellow player has a cool idea: The principled cop gets frustrated and angry just like anyone else and he makes a terrible mistake. That could be a great story, too. I don't feel like I should just get to block that storyline, simply because the good cop is my character. Fight over it using the system, yes. Block, no.<br/><br/>This is the essence of story games, for me. All of the players contribute to the story as the primary activity (as opposed to "playing the characters" as the primary thing). The ideas of my fellow players are just as important and valid in the creation of story as my ideas, even when they touch on my character (at any point of the 7 level chart).<br/><br/>Maybe we <i>are</i> playing the story about the good cop who suddenly makes a stupid mistake? Or it could be the slow descent into badness that I was thinking originally. Or it could be the thing that Tony is grinning about down at the other end of the table. Which one? We play <i>to find out which one it is</i>, rather than deciding ahead of time and then manipulating things to come out a certain way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95808/#Comment_95808" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T03:04:05+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  3:04AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>This is the heart of most great stories, IMO.

For me, though, part of the kick I get out of RPGs is the ability to NOT do some stupid things you see characters subject themselves to in movies. I do agree that weakness and conflict make interesting elements of a game, I prefer a bit more of a "carrot" approach in encouraging the player to overcome their <i>de facto</i> removal from the situation and submit to weakness. If, as a GM, I take the wheel from the player in dictating their character's actions, I feel as if I am squelching their input as a participant in the game.<br/><br/>Just as there are certain story devices that I do not enjoy in movies, shows, and books, there are certain story devices I do not want to be subjected to in a game.

If there is a strong GM (i.e. lots of influence/authority over setting, npcs, etc.) then the GM should not also have authority over player characters - if for no other reason then soon the other players won't have influence over anything. But with a weak/no GM (other players have substantial influence of setting, npcs, etc.) then it is less imperative for players to have strong authority over individual characters labeled PCs... in fact, there is less imperative for there to be any characters designated as PCs at all.<br/><br/>But this is related to my binary preferences. I either want absolute authority over my character (in a strong GM game) so that I have at least something I have influence over, or I don't care at all (in a weak GM game) - go ahead and take control of "my PC" - I'll just spend more time describing the scene, or introduce another character, or...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96247/#Comment_96247" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T03:47:53+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  3:47AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Even though I have a strong preference, I understand that the dial needs to spin when I play different games.

This lets players "shift around" in order to maintain their purity.<br/><br/>If the real point of seduction roll against PC was to isolate them, delay them, get them to reveal information, or set them up to have their spouse angry at them, a PC who loses can narrate how the seduction accomplished any or all of those but didn't actually seduce them, make them think that character was sexy (sorry, I just don't go that way), or result in them "doing the deed".  Watch enough soap operas and even "point was PC ends up having impregnated someone" doesn't require intercourse.  <br/><br/>One can still keep mystery &amp;  leave room to say, "well let's say it really about you being isolated from contact with people for a while and maybe having said more than you ideally want to about your upcoming trip to Zanzibar" or just "well, if you lose it's at least two of those things, pick which ones."<br/><br/>That kind of conflict-over-stakes-stated play (as opposed to "we roll for the seduction but you don't really know the key points of why that will matter") rather than task-based play seems to support player room to control concept as well as long as the elements of concept themselves can't be staked (core beliefs, goals etc).<br/><br/>Which all reminds me of games where the right to narrate a win or loss is not cemented in one set of hands but itself part of what can be bought back and forth (e.g., Pool) recognizing that "narration of meaning" is a valuable asset.  What really sucks is to lose conflict and lose ability to narrate what loss looks like.  Wheter it's a social skill or just an effort to look dashing, both sorts of loss can result in stress on character concept; though since social skills are often about "what decision you make" they seem a more direct route to challenging character concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96682/#Comment_96682" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T19:16:02+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  7:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Beason</cite>I don't like the idea of the GM or another player using a mundane skill like seduction or debate to change my character's thoughts or feelings.

It can just mean your actions have been influenced beyond your better judgement. When I started training MMA, my plan was to go from gym to gym and do a trial class at each one, and see which one suited me best. That was my philosophy and intention for trying out the gym. At the end of the class I got talked into signing up right then. The whole time I was nervous about it, I didn't think I should be doing it but I was doing it anyway. I'm not sure exactly how he did it, but having trained there for years now and worked there as well, he has mentioned he could sell ice to an Eskimo.

If you don't trust the other players (or the GM) with the fate of your character you will want to give as little control away as possible. Conversely if you (as a GM) don't trust the players to do the right things with their characters you will want more ways to make them do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Story games require a lot more trust than traditional games. If you've encountered even the least of the creepy gamers discussed at RPG.net then you would know that there are plenty of gamers you would never go near with a story game, because you couldn't trust them with the fate of anything, even their own character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone who GM's more than plays (in recent years anyway), I have often encountered the problem of players who can't RP a social situation <i>without</i> a mechanic, they just can't make decisions their character would make, rather than the ones they, the player, would want.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for example (and its a real example) I was running a GURPS game with a character who was a gambling addict. His background was all about wasting his fortune away till he was living in the gutters, and even then anything he got he would throw away on the next toss of the dice. (Mechanically he had poor, and gambling adict as disadvantages, and quirks of never refusing a bet).<br/>\n<br/>\nYet when that character found himself in a glitzy gambling den with low, medium and high stakes tables the player insisted on playing low stakes only, and not betting more than the minimum, and backing out when he had lost a moderate amount, and going home instead of staying to gamble. And it happened more than once too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he had a character set up to be a certain way yet couldn't bear to actually do that. What the player wanted for his character was so much at odds with what the character should have wanted that leaving it up to the player to RP just didn't work. As a GM I <i>needed</i> the mechanics (will rolls and so forth) to enforce actions on the character because the player couldn't be trusted to do it ... just like the often mentioned kid saying "no you missed" in cops and robbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure that was bad RP. He shouldn't have had a character like that if he wasn't prepared to play out that sort of story. Its easy to put the blame on that player, but this sort of thing can happen to even the best player. Sometimes something happens to your character and you just don't like it, even though it is the right thing as far as the character is concerned. You cry when your much loved character dies, even if he died sacrificing himself to save his loved ones. You hate to give over the wonderful new shiny treasure you just got, even though your character took a vow of poverty. And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not our characters, and we are only human. Sometimes we just don't want to do what our characters would want to do, for whatever reason. In combat we usually accept that there is a mechanic that takes over for us in such situations. I might prefer that my character doesn't get harmed at all when fighting the dragon but the system says "Sorry, nothing doing". But in social situations, without a mechanic, we can get stuck in that gap between character and player and just do the wrong thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is mind control magic acceptable? Its because it invokes a mechanic that tells us we have to accept the change. Diplomacy, seduction, intimidation, love ... they can all be as forceful as mind control magic, but when they don't have a mechanic to back them up we can wriggle out of it all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97953/#Comment_97953" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T14:51:08+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  2:51PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2007 2:52PM by Joe_Beason.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><br>The whole time I was nervous about it, I didn't think I should be doing it but I was doing it anyway.
