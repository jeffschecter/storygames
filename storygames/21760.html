I owe pretty much all the rules to either Eero or Sandra, and I'm prepared to be accused of treating Eero's writings in particular with the reverence that he denies Gygax et al. I don't think I do, but I can see why it'd seem that way.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i4oONmt9IKNc_8Z5hGeAW0NEsT5awJI9FWcq8YiHCkw/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">The rules, or thereabouts</a><br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b0DVwVhpjnF5fGn1IBVjNySnj37q0P1TlkV5eCvF1Ec/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">The world \u2013 sadly only in Swedish</a><br/><br/>In short: the Holy Roman Empire stretches from the Netherlands all the way down through Italy. To the east is Prague and elven-infested forests (so no known counterparts to Poland, Russia etc). To the west is Gaul: deep wilderness, barbarian settlements some of which might even be called "cities", and remains of ancient Roman conquests, reclaimed by nature and the Gauls. (One such Roman ruin is Stonehell Dungeon, which was the party's first goal. With its ten levels it can keep them busy for the whole campaign, but they might tire and try something else halfway through.)<br/><br/>I have some ideas for how the Holy Roman Empire fits together, but it's pretty handwavy and mostly the setting is just an excuse to get the party out in the wilderness and into the pre-written adventure modules that I've plopped down here and there. The first session I gave them a choice between a "wizard tower, you've heard there's treasure" and "an old ruined fort where you've heard there are gigantic underground vaults full of treasure". They chose the latter, so we go to Stonehell.

F. Tr\xe1in, a fearless adventurer and natural leader<br/>- Jauques, a Gaul, but at least he speaks Germanic<br/>- Conrad, the seventh son of a farm that didn't really have any use for more sons<br/>- Unintelligible, a mighty warrior of Jylland<br/>- Nameless, a mysterious figure (name held off until level 2)<br/><br/>All are Adventurers except for Unintelligible who is a Fighter. Lacking Sages, they have no-one who knows any more languages, no-one ordained, and no-one with knowledge of the arcane arts.<br/><br/>This thread will contain spoilers of Stonehell, of course. Maybe other modules in future sessions; I will mark those comments accordingly.<br/><br/><br/>Part 1: Towards the fort<br/><br/>We start the session with the adventurers disembarking the fishing boat with which they had hitched a ride from Maastricht up the river Maas. They have travelled for two days, and have food for 9 days in their packs. They start by the fallen Roman bridge by the river bend that they had been told about, and set out to follow the overgrown roman stone road through the hills.<br/><br/>Nameless immediately rolls a natural 1 on their pathfinding, and the party gets lost within hours. I told them they were lost immediately\u2014still debating with myself whether I should roll pathfinding rolls in secret in the future\u2014and they realised that they were now instead following a small trail, which had veered off to the east.<br/><br/>They encounter a riderless horse in panic. They fail to stop it, fail to locate the rider (unbeknownst to them: a frontier ranger, now dead after a barbarian attack), and then backtrack to the road without sighting the horse again.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After two more days of uneventful travel they have passed into the forest and up along the mountainside. Reaching a clearing on high ground, they sight the "fort": a ravine enclosed by a wall (similar to Helm's Deep). The wall is collapsed in several places, but the imposing gatehouse still stands. Within the wall, an overgrown courtyard with ruins of smaller\u2014and a gate into the mountain wall at the far end of the ravine.<br/><br/>They look for smoke or flags, but seeing none, they cautiously approach the gatehouse. The gates are long since broken open, the portcullis is down but several bars are rusted and broken allowing normal-sized people to climb inside. The passage through the gatehouse has arrow-slits facing inward from both sides, and ends with another portcullis in similar shape.<br/><br/>G.F. and Conrad climb in. G.F. spies through the arrow slits on the north side, and sees only darkness. Conrad goes to the south side, but hears a whooshing, whining noise approaching him! They spook and go around to climb over a collapsed wall section.<br/><br/>The good climbers make it up and throw down a rope to help the others. While hauling up G.F. (Who's only at Strength 6), Conrad notices someone spying on them from atop the wall. Whoever it is sneaks away (failed morale roll from my side) but Conrad warns the party.<br/><br/>They make it down to the other side and into the Gatehouse from the back entrance. They find the northern arrow-slit room, which is empty. Then they smell smoke and meat coming from another room nearby. They prepare for an ambush and open the door, but there's no-one inside. Some sleeping furs and food in disarray hints at someone who left in a huff\u2014perhaps retreating to higher ground? There is a ladder nearby.<br/><br/>However, soon after they open the creaky door the hatch above the ladder also opens, and an arrow comes flying down! Jauques shouts up at the attackers, asking who they are\u2014in Gaul. Fortunately, they understand her. They are Gauls in exile from their village, who have claimed the gatehouse as theirs. The party quickly agrees to not disturb the gatehouse, although they don't actually promise anything about the southern room, which the Gauls claim to be haunted. When they say their goal is the vaults under the fort, the Gauls laugh, saying they will likely die. Jauques asks that the party be allowed to explore the ravine and enter the vaults without being attacked, and in exchange promises a share of the loot when they return. The Gauls accept. On their way out, Jauques steals the food they left behind (1 ration). 50 XP (10 XP per HD of creatures encountered and "handled"\u2014basically anything short of a full retreat will give them the monster XP.)<br/><br/>Inside the ravine, the party quickly spot two smaller gates in the mountain walls; one to the north and one to the south. They decide to explore these before going for the main vault.<br/><br/>In the north one, they encounter a fire beetle and kill it. (10 XP) They have never seen such a creature before, and the intrepid G. F. Tr\xe1in with the help of the knowledgeable Nameless manage to extract two glowing glands from the carcass. They tie them to sticks to make torches, which show now signs of going out! (They will last a few days.) The beetle's lair also held a half-eaten goat kid, which they clean and cut up for 4 rations of food.<br/><br/>They search some more rooms, and find a piece of flame chalk: the writing is invisible, except when heated up by e.g. holding a torch nearby. They find a message written in the same chalk, telling of a stash of jewels hidden two floors down, in the chamber past the acolytes cells, along with warning of "the wasps".<br/><br/>They also encounter some green slime, which sticks to their clothes and eats through them.  was lucky to wear gloves, since he stuck his hand right in it while searching a box. Jauques was being snarky about it (he thought), so he put his hand on Jauques shoulder and left the glove there! They lost one perfectly good glove, and ruined Jauques' cloak by cutting off a chunk of the corner. But no-one got their flesh dissolved, so, great success! They left the slime in the room they found it, after a half-hearted attempt to pick it up. I hope they come back for it if they find an enemy they want to throw slime at <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (20 XP)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since the sun is still high, they decide to tackle the southern side-cave. The first room has a chilly air and a sense of unease, and they soon spotted faint blue lights glowing at eye-height from the next room. Turns out it's the magical glowing eyes of several animated skeletons, that start marching down the corridor towards the fearless G. F. Tr\xe1in! The session's longest fight, perhaps 5 rounds long, ensues. All skeletons are slain but Unintelligible takes a rusty sword to the gut! It's a major injury, all his abilities are halved, and Conrad rushes him outside into the sun and starts cleaning the wound.<br/><br/>After finishing up the skeletons, they search the rest of the southern rooms and find them devoid of valuables. There are many mysterious runes, and a strange chest-high dome-shaped monument that seems to be the source of the unnatural chill. They immediately take to calling this evil place "the refrigerator" and debate the merits of storing their game there if they were to replenish their food supplies by hunting.<br/><br/>We end the session as they make camp in the northern chambers (next to the fire beetle's lair). Unintelligible's player will be missing for the first half of next session, which happens to align with the fact that he shouldn't be up and about immediately. Depending on how far the other four have come when he joins tomorrow, he'll either get to play a wounded Fighter, or roll up a replacement character.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Tune in next time, when the party might end up actually entering Stonehell!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475927/#Comment_475927" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T00:00:40+00:00" title="August  8, 2018 12:00AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stonehell is good stuff; I haven't read it, but I've played it for quite a few sessions (of hitting our collective heads on the goblins in the first quarter of the first floor, but still).<br/><br/>Your fantasy Europe reminds me of the Warhammer Old World in the particulars. You might, if it's relevant, discover some occasional heat by taking influence where appropriate.<br/><br/>Also, that's a very cool set of rules you have there, I like a lot of the ideas [grin]. I don't think that my house tradition has ever had such a comprehensive written description in one place. There are GMs who play with high enough influence from me to consider them disciples (in a strictly factual sociology sense - I don't run a D&amp;D school or anything like that), but I don't think that anybody's committed their rules set to paper in that much detail. It's very cool, and if you don't mind I might link people to this write-up on occasion to give a quick rundown of how we play old school D&amp;D here.<br/><br/>You're the first person I know who's tried to adopt my house system down to the mechanical detail without having played it with me - you're doing all the funky mechanical bits, it seems, like the different ability score line and success-counting and stunting in combat. Do let me know if you run into any difficulties with the mechanical particulars; I haven't really focused in explaining those in detail in the Internet in any systematic fashion, so for all I know there might be some really obvious and useful little rules that I use but that I haven't mentioned in whatever sources you've researched for this.<br/><br/>Also, props for using my new skill system - my primary disciples have shied away from it, clearly thinking that I've suffered an aneurysm and started crafting rules bloat [grin]. If you come to any significant conclusions or observations about the percentage-fraction skill rules, please do share; I am still far from tapping all the implications there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475928/#Comment_475928" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T00:01:20+00:00" title="August  8, 2018 12:01AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2018 12:07AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few observations about the rules follow. These aren't corrections so much as simple notes on a few places where your writeup differs from how I play. If any are intentional, good for you - owning the rules mechanics you use is central to GMing something like this, I think.<br/><br/><b>Being thrown off a cliff:</b> Kudos for daring to list that as a circumstance that bypasses hitpoints - I'm much too amused by the traditional "1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen" falling math to do that myself. A good example of something that is simply a stylistic choice as far as I'm concerned, as long as you're consistent.<br/><br/><b>Goetia:</b> My original intention in like 2012 when I established the initial version of these rules was that memory slot spell casters (only one possible type of magic here) need a separate initiation (feat) for each spell level. The first initiation was called "Goetia". I was also flirting with the idea that while Goetia allows you to learn any 1st level spell whatsoever, there could be other initiations that e.g. give you levels 1-3 from a specific school of magic, or whatever.<br/><br/>Exhaustive actual play has indicated that requiring a separate initiation for every spell level is a relatively harsh requirement, while initiating different magical traditions is indeed a fun way to distinguish in a deep way between two magic-users, while still being elegant and using the same spells for each. I don't think that we ultimately have ever had a player with a simple "Goetia II" initiation that would simply allow them to use 2nd level spells with no further significance.<br/><br/>This is to say, treat Goetia with care; it's fine as a generic starter initiation, but give players opportunities to get more and more flavourful initiations with less limitations. Goetia is particularly a good starter for newbies because giving them something like "Oshian Illusionism" doesn't benefit them any when they find their first spell books and scrolls, all written for Neo-Platonic hermetics, and then they find that they can't learn these new spells. At least a generic initiation, even if harshly level-limited, avoids that particular disappointment.<br/><br/><b>Ritual magic:</b> As your magic rules do not comment on this, I assume that you don't use "ritual magic", which is something that I use extensively myself. "Ritual magic" is the local term for the idea that all spell slot magic is <i>actually</i> ritual magic that is simply cast in advance - the traditional "spell memorization" is replaced by ritual casting, so wizards don't so much sit with a spell book every day as they do magical rituals. Ritual casting normally (as in, until the players start fine-tuning this) takes an hour per spell level, costs 1 rupee per spell level in reagents, and requires a spell-casting check against DC 20+[spell level]. (The dice roll is obviated for an initiated magician doing a routine casting within their comfort zone - such as when memorizing spells for later use.)<br/><br/>The ritual magic conceit has three big, fat implications: the first is that any character can learn and cast spells, they just can't prepare them for use later like a magic-user can. The second is that you can cast the same spell multiple times per day, as long as you're OK with the ritual casting taking hours at the time. The third is that characters can learn spells over their level, they just can't prepare them. The spell-caster initiations in this scheme are not so you can <i>learn</i> spells, they are so you can do that without having to roll dice, and so you can prepare them in advance for casting at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>I mention the ritual magic rules because I am personally very fond of them, and think that they're some of our finer mechanical work. They solve a lot of the artificial weirdness in D&amp;D elegantly, without injuring the dungeoneering logic. It also helps make high-level magic exciting that your character doesn't need to get to like level 45 to use that high-level spell - they can just take the risks and expenses of a magical ritual, instead. It might be surprising, but apparently allowing 1st level characters to cast a Fireball with three hours of preparation and a risky skill check does not break the game.<br/><br/><b>The other two character classes:</b> I note that you're only using the three character classes I established initially in the game. I've since added two, the "Ascetic" and "Servant", myself. I'm fond of them and think that they serve a purpose, but the game obviously runs fine without, as well.<br/><br/><b>Monster XP:</b> Yes, I am in favour of this math. Rather elegant, and a subtle fuck you to expectations about advancing by monster-slaying [grin]. As I've said at some point, I like to keep monster XP in the game, but I consider it more of a stylistic detail than a serious scoring device.<br/><br/><b>Questing philosophy:</b> I disagree with you about the conditions in which a quest is a quest. You write that quests undertaken out of greed are not quests, while I am of the opposite mind: anything the characters do in the game that is interesting enough to play out in detail should achieve them experience points on success. That's what the points are, a gauge of character success. If something is not worthy of points, it should not be worthy of play, either.<br/><br/>This means that I certainly make sure that a character who decides to find an ancient magical book gets quest xp for it. It does not matter whether they're finding the book for selfish reasons or on behalf of somebody else; all that matters is that it's a proper quest declared in advance, and that the character is not scoring treasure XP by selling the book - if they are, then obviously they can't double-dib by also getting quest XP.<br/><br/>I generally refuse to do adventures as a player in old school D&amp;D if those adventures do not score experience points. XPs are the goal, as far as I'm concerned, so any set of rules that prevents me from going on an exciting adventure by refusing me the points is bugged [grin].<br/><br/><b>Healing:</b> I've started calling "how many short rests I have taken today" with a special name, because it is essentially a character statistic. I suppose you could say "fatigue" in English - so you start an adventure with zero fatigue points, and normally a night of rest zeroes you out again, and so on. The actual rule is still the same - you take as many penalty dice to your hitpoint rerolls as you have fatigue points. It's just maybe a little bit easier for people to understand the rule, and it's more natural to add and subtract when we call them points instead of "how many short rests", etc.<br/><br/>One thing you might also want to do is to add to this daily "fatigue" score on the basis of character encumbrance, starvation, sleep deprivation, etc. I notice that you have some pretty heavy-duty rules for these things in there. It wouldn't be a bad idea if they were also reflected in hit point refreshment, and it's a simple thing to do.<br/><br/><b>Learning new skills:</b> I note that you don't really comment on that in there. I've been letting players take a "heroic skill breakthrough" at the end of a session of play instead of an ability score improvement roll to improve one of their skills, and I've largely liked the option: it is in line with how "big a deal" I envision skills to be, which is to say, not very.<br/><br/><b>Stunting:</b> I hope you're doing combat stunting! It is one of the high points of your system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475929/#Comment_475929" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T00:09:04+00:00" title="August  8, 2018 12:09AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, that seems like it was a good adventuring session.

I like these opportunities myself as a GM; the players generally starve me for details about their characters, so I will hold dearly onto anything at all they give me, and it is always a joy when something about an individual character happens to matter for the events in play. The players enjoy it as well when their characters are acknowledged as individuals; it is this process, more than anything else, that begins a character's transition into a mid-levels one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475931/#Comment_475931" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T06:34:27+00:00" title="August  8, 2018  6:34AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback and comments!<br/><br/><b>On falling from cliffs</b>: actually I didn't think this one through. I do intend to use the standard 1d6 per 10' fallen, and when writing that I must have thought about cliffs that are essentially high enough that you roll more d6's than your current HP or something. But technically it's not the same category as save or die: it's a specific unsurvivable amount of HP damage <img alt=":grin:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/grin.png" title=":grin:"/> <br/><br/>On that note, I'm edging towards your notion of generalised HP that protects against everything. For starters, all poisons will be different combinations of exhaustion penalties and HP damage, up to the ones that are save-or-die by the book being 10HP, possibly higher for higher-level threats. But the regular poisonous wildlife and monsters you'd find in upper Stonehell for example, they'd be save or 10 dmg. Same with magical save-or-die effects. (The 4th-degree stunt of bypassing HP could be countered by paying 10HP per level of the attacker, and then taking the regular damage\u2014I think this checks out.)<br/><br/><b>On magic</b>: I hadn't thought much of where to go after Goetia, and I hadn't thought of ritual magic. I really like it though, and if the players go there something similar will certainly evolve in this campaign!<br/><br/><b>On skills</b>: I was wondering how this would be met, but for starters it sort of plays like the "player-facing" mechanic is just: sometimes the GM tells you you can't use your whole ability score on a specific roll; write down the number you agree on. And the whole percentage crunch is sort of under the hood. Of course I want my players to do the skill maths independently and I think they will soon, but so far it was used for one roll (Conrad trying to clean and stabilise Unintelligible's wound) and I think they'll be there pretty quickly. The ones who care about the system have read the rules doc, of course.<br/><br/>The reason I don't mention skill learning is actually because I was a bit wary on the whole improvement mechanic you use, with one ability or skill improved per session. Main reason is that it muddles the simulation/genre split: abilities and skill are cold, hard simulation whereas levels and HP are a narrative conceit on top. Improving abilities during downtime (training and whatnot) fits in, a random +1 per session less so. But I just sort of put off the decision and never made it before we started playing, and after the major injury I really see the argument from variance: the abilities vary a lot, affect the results a lot, and the game is just more interesting if there's a back-and-forth between improvement and injuries rather than just an attrition :P So I'm introducing the ability improvement rolls in today's session unless anyone objects, and probably the skills as well (like you've said, it's a good consolation prize for the poor sod who doesn't roll over any of their abilities).<br/><br/><b>On quests</b>: Hm. My reasoning was that if you quest for magic powers, those are your reward\u2014and they go outside the level system. So, the point were that the improvement is the reward, and XPs are the main way of getting there. Being strict about XP being a measure of success, <i>at whatever we decide to play</i>, has its charm, but I also feel like the game <i>deciding</i> for you what counts has its merits. I mean, if we go completely free-form and the players can e.g. negotiate that their party are dwarven scholars documenting the stonework, and get XP per room explored... There are loads of interesting non-treasure goals you could negotiate, but it kind of seems like a hassle? And if we set down from a rules perspective that actually, gold is worth XP whether your characters care about it or not\u2014you don't negotiate whether you want this expedition to be per-gold or per-room\u2014then you shape what kind of characters get made, and what kind of adventures they have, for better or worse. I think I stand by my choice of having pure "improve my abilities" quests not be for XP. XP is the measure of success, and you should only do a non-XP side-quest for magic powers if you think it'll be worth it in the end, or if you play less than 100% to win and want to improve your character <i>despite it not being measured as success</i>.<br/><br/><b>On fatigue and healing</b>: I was thinking about this, and a fatigue score is a clean way to combine the two systems, I'll definitely think about it. I actually had some compunctions about even the fatigue disadvantage hit die in the first place, for the same reason as above: if HP is purely narrative, it doesn't follow that you get less of it the more tired you are. I justified keeping it by saying it makes sense as a mechanic for shaping the narrative: it punishes adventurers who take overlong adventuring days. Likewise, it doesn't follow to me that this "not too much in a day" counter should have anything to do with the "walking for days across a desert with no food" counter of exhaustion. It could, sure, but it doesn't have to. Right now the fatigue hits on HP, and exhaustion hits on abilities (-X to all rolls); two incomparables. You could make the argument for combining them, but you could also make the argument for flipping them around if you really wanted to. I'll see what we settle on in this campaign, and it might get reflected in the document.<br/><br/><b>On stunting</b>: I hope so too. The Fighter's very first attack, after the whole party had whiffed, was 20 above AC and he rent that fucking fire beetle in twain <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Other than that we haven't had any combat stunting but I'm still learning the ropes myself and I'm going to try to encourage the players to do it as they get extra successes. I have kept the mechanic in mind for knowledge checks etc but I think most rolls have actually been within +-5 of the DC.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Second session starts in half an hour <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475935/#Comment_475935" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T11:20:25+00:00" title="August  8, 2018 11:20AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The philosophical reason for why hit points can be affected by things other than avoiding sword strokes is, of course, that certain events pre-justify character death dramatically: if hit points are a dramatic rule that predisposes characters to survive dangers, then it makes sense that behaviors and circumstances that foreshadow death also take away hit points.<br/><br/>This is why I have characters lose hit points (or suffer fatigue penalties to hit point refresh) when they take a long force march or deprive themselves of sleep or encounter stressful circumstances: these are all things that foreshadow this character's weakness. I know that this is very similar to strict physical simulation, but that's how human storytelling is: it sort of flirts with reality. Things that would exhaust people in reality, and therefore make them more likely to make a mistake and die in combat, will shave off hit points in D&amp;D and cause the same.<br/><br/>This is the same logic that works backwards when hit points are refreshed, by the way: the underlying reason for why your character regains their hit points during a short rest is that the short rest is a dramaturgical signal about how you're safe for now. It's not exactly because the character needs a moment to catch their breath and gauge their injuries and steel themself against coming horrors, but rather because them having the opportunity to do this is a statement about the fact that this specific action sequence did not manage to kill the character, and therefore they can have some more hit points for their next trouble.<br/><br/>In general I've found that I never regret assigning hit point penalties to to anything in this system - the quick refresh combined with the fatigue system makes it work fine. Somebody tells your character that they're married to their sister, so yeah, take a 1d10 psychological damage, why not. Dropped to zero hit points? Uh, seems like you'll want to make a Will save to avoid indefinite insanity over the shock. By all means, friends, do continue saying horrible things to each other - it's just a few hit points for every nasty jab, and you'll get them back when you take the time to catch your breath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475946/#Comment_475946" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T19:47:15+00:00" title="August  8, 2018  7:47PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2: Wildlife encounters<br/><br/>They settle in for the night, and the random encounter table rolls 2 brigands in first watch. The watchman Conrad is sitting in the dark opening with no fire, so I rule that Conrad sees the brigands' lantern while they don't spot him. They disappear up the switchback trail in the night. In the morning hours I roll up 1 wolf, but again the watchman stays still and the wolf, while aware of the party, doesn't attack because of a failed morale check.<br/><br/>Unintelligible's (who we decided to call Dan which is Swedish for Dane, which is what he is) injury is examined: in addition to the permanently halved abilities, he will have -4 to everything today and -2 to everything tomorrow\u2014with the added risk of prolonging the recovery if he stresses the wound (i.e. when failing physical rolls with large enough margin). He is left to rest in the northern chambers for now.<br/><br/>The other four examine the pool under the waterfall: the water is apparently hot, and there's no clear egress. They spot what looks like a metal plate at the bottom of the rocky pool.<br/><br/>Then they head into the eastern chambers: the third mini-dungeon at surface level. They find old leaves, trash, and old furniture. After a knowledge check they infer that the dressing of the various chambers has varied a lot in age, from "old and worn" to "completely rotten away". They agree that people must have come and gone in different waves for some reason; used the place and then abandoned it again. (I try to play down the "adventurers come here all the time so there's been regular traffic for decades" angle and keep the place more ancient, forgotten and unknown as well as keeping "adventurer" from becoming a social class rather than a crazy idea. These rooms became a slightly more boring as a result.)<br/><br/>In the second room they meet a rabid raccoon. They kill it easily, and Nameless feels lucky indeed that its bite hadn't penetrated her boot, when they notice after the battle that it's frothing at the mouth. 10 XP.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They explore the various corridors, including a lot of trying to force stubborn stone doors open. The western half of the complex has settled a little, with rubble on the floor from a cave-in and a lot of cracks in the stonework. They startle a cobra among the rubble, but manage to back off and let it crawl back into its nest. 10 XP.<br/><br/>They find a throne room with a spiked it trap in front of the throne. About here is where Conrad's player decide that this place must have been built for the lulz essentially, since there are too much logistical hassle for anyone to have such a thing. Sure if you want to kill the messenger, click the button in the throne armrest to have them fall to their death. Then what? How do you clean up? Your throne room now smells of blood and gore for weeks? What if a servant falls in by mistake? I sort of want the dungeon to make more sense, but eh, I have wizards (or similar) to blame when it comes to the actual explanation. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21035/glossary-of-key-phrases-while-dm-ing/p1" rel="nofollow">Weird, right? But that's what you see.</a><br/><br/>This was Conrad and Nameless exploring on their own, while Jauques and G.F. Tr\xe1in were sitting in the raccoon room trying to skin it and make a hat. They rolled dismally, so they were looking at two hours of scraping and greasing, whereupon the pelt would have molded before it could be sewn into a hat anyway.<br/><br/>Conrad and Nameless also find the secret door in the throne room, but can't get it open without help so they interrupt the hat-making contingent and ask them to help. The door leads to a hidden study: a stone table and bookshelves upon empty bookshelves. Jauques finds the secret compartment in the table, containing an unadorned silver ring, a small clear potion, and a bag of 50sp! Their first treasure!<br/><br/>The whole party, apparently postponing the raccoon hat, investigates the remaining rooms and find a) a disused bedroom, b) a disused bedroom infested by large insects (fist-sized pillbugs by the module, but I forgot what a pillbug was so I just said "bug" and then improvised that they were some sort of locusts) and c) a room with a crude trap. Nameless got hit in the head with a sandbag as she opened the last door, broke her nose and got a concussion (dropped to subzero HP but made her saves).<br/><br/>As they search the room with the trap, Nameless is walking back toward the exit and hears something moving in the room with the raccoon. A huge black bear has wandered in and is eating their half-skinned raccoon carcass! "My hat!" exclaims G.F.<br/><br/>They wait for the bear to leave on its own, but after half an hour G.F. grows impatient. (I rolled for how long the bear would be chilling there, and they would have only had to wait for 10 more minutes.) He's a man of action! He lights a torch and jumps out trying to scare the bear away. It panics and attacks. He and Jauques hold it off with torches while the others dash for the exit. I have the defenders roll Will checks to intimidate the bear with their fire and noise, but they kept failing, so they "hold off" the bear by tanking its attacks. The bear is 4HD and has three attacks, which is pretty dangerous, but I roll badly so only near the end of the combat does it get a bite in, bringing G.F. below zero HP as well. He makes his saves, getting a nasty minor wound in his left arm, and they back out and scatter. The bear doesn't follow.<br/><br/>My rules say monster XP is for monsters that are overcome in some way, and we agreed the players didn't really overcome them as they more or less just escaped. It was a close enough call that I had to agree that the bear didn't really overcome them either, so it would also miss out on its XP :P<br/><br/><br/><br/>This was the half-way point of the session, and Unintelligible's player joined us. I'll write up the next half of the session\u2014when they finally go down into Stonehell proper!\u2014in the next post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475948/#Comment_475948" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T20:14:18+00:00" title="August  8, 2018  8:14PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love you Jonatan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475949/#Comment_475949" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-08T20:17:48+00:00" title="August  8, 2018  8:17PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Players don't get to do any GM tasks</blockquote>\nSo this is a difference from how I do it.

I'm fine with Dan sticking around in their base camp as a backup character; he'll be a little more viable in a few days. If the player wants to bring both characters into the dungeon, he'll have to play one of them and the other gets demoted to essentially a hireling.<br/><br/>The new character is a Sage; an English monk recently thrown out of his monastery (he doesn't mention the thrown out part). We establish that G. F. Tr\xe1in had quite the recruitment campaign when putting the party together, and the monk heard about it right after they set out, decided to come after them, and just now catches up. The monk doesn't get a proper name but we can call him Father. We elide the introductions and get to dungeon delving!<br/><br/>The main gate leads to a single square room with a round staircase in the middle, going down. A small verse is carved into the archway above:<br/>Beware All Who Enter<br/>These Benighted Halls of Stone.<br/>Within Lies No Solace<br/>Nor Any Comforts of Home.<br/>Toiling For Our Crimes<br/>We Must Dig Where We Dwell,<br/>With No Freedom or Mercy<br/>In Our Vast Stony Hell.<br/><br/>(Conrad remarks that the first rhyme was iffy, but Father assures us it's better in the original latin, from which he was translating.)<br/><br/>They debate the sanity of a nation that builds something like this as a prison, as opposed to the economic option of using the death penalty or, I don't know, building normal houses. The possibility that the fort originally had another purpose, and the rhyme was added as a curse was cast upon it or something, is floated.<br/><br/>By the staircase, they find lots of messages scrawled into the stone walls, as well as a lot of tally marks (counting days or years). The one message they can easily make out and understand is in germanic, and reads: "clean up after yourselves!".<br/><br/><br/><br/>They go down. The staircase exits into a large room with several exits. Some of the corridors leading out are adorned with archways carved to look like grotesque mouths of ogres or something, with fangs. Jauques remarks "what is this, Hell's Entrance Hall or what?" I found this funny since I had never mentioned the name Stonehell to them, nor used the word hell outside the poem above, and this section is named "Hell's Antechamber" in the module.<br/><br/>They start with the nearest door, finding a disused kitchen. The pump over the dry wash basin at first seems stuck, but then it starts pressing out green slime! They quickly stop, and leave the clump of slime hanging from the faucet.<br/><br/>They try the next door but the doors down here, while unlocked, are really stubborn to open. This stems from my reading of the rules, where opening even unlocked doors requires Open Doors checks which take a whole exploration turn. It seems weird to all of us, but we settle on a sort of fairy tale logic where "that's just the nature of the doors here". They get stuck in various ways, the hinges rust etc, and each requires the right combination of pressure, well-meaning tackles and finagling.<br/><br/>After Nameless, who is still concussed, has struggled with the same door for half an hour, a group of skulking humanoids arrive (photo reference: Gollum). They chatter amongst themselves in an unknown language, but when hailed by Jauques it turns out at least some of them understand Gaul. They are shy and easily spooked, but introduce themselves as the gloomies, the caretakers of this place. They live here, but when answered whether they own the place they quickly defer to "the Black Bears". The Black Bears apparently owns the place now (implying they haven't always) and the gloomies must serve their betters.<br/><br/>G. F. Tr\xe1in tries speaking "barbaric" with them as well: running out babbling "bar bar bar!". One of the gloomies misunderstand him and tries to answer in Latin, which causes the priest to check in. Jauques tries to hire the leader as a guide, but he asks for an outrageous price. Father rolls an astonishing 72 on a charisma check (d20 exploded twice), and gets a guide for free! The youngest among the gloomies is a devout Christian convert, God knows how or why, and has been branded with a cross by his kin (or by himself?). He asks if Father will take him in and teach him, much to the scorn of his gloomy peers, and Father of course accepts him into his flock.<br/><br/>At this point Nameless gives up on the stubborn door and joins the others, which prompts laughter from all the gloomies as they can see by her broken nose that she walked into their hilarious trap upstairs! They admit to keeping all traps around here functional, because they have always done so.<br/><br/>The gloomies leave (except for Doggo), after giving up some more information. Doggo is young and doesn't know many details about the place, but he does know the placement of some traps, and the routes between places he's been. They learn that the northern passages lead to "The Dragon" as well as an offshoot passage to the "Living Dead"\u2014both of which are places the gloomies don't go. The southern door holds a "scary old man who yells at you", and the southeast passage leads back to the gloomies' home (that's where the rest of them slunk away to).<br/><br/>(part 3 part 2 in a separate post because this one got too long)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475975/#Comment_475975" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-09T16:53:49+00:00" title="August  9, 2018  4:53PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doggo helps them with the stubborn door. The module claims that everyone living here are used to the doors' peculiarities and aren't hindered by them. I will run it as them having a much easier time, since they can start by trying to open them with skill at DC 20 taking no time; and only if they fail they must resort to Strength checks taking a full exploration turn like the party. I'm not sure about the underlying mechanics but I had Doggo rolling at +10, thinking that the adult gloomies probably roll at +15. (I said that Doggo rolled with Wits, but in retrospect perhaps it should have been Knowledge. Hm.)<br/><br/>Behind the doors they find a small dining room and room badly burnt by a fire (they speculate about dragon fire). Nameless takes a wooden shield that hung in the dining hall like a heraldic weapon; we had been discussing the shield rules and she was regretting not getting one from start.<br/><br/>They choose to wait with both the dragon and the living dead, and start by tackling the Old Man Who Yells At You. They open the door into an empty room with skeletal remains and blood stains on the floor, with another door and a rusty portcullis leading out. About a minute after entering\u2014while Nameless is searching the room for secrets\u2014a wind buffets through the portcullis and a booming voice tells them "Fools! Flee before your bones rest here forever!" Nothing else happens.<br/><br/>The portcullis is rusted in place and heavy, but not locked, so they manage to get it up after struggling for a while. Nameless stands watch, and at one point sees a party carrying a lantern approach from the north corridor (the one leading to the alleged dragon). She quickly covers her own light and tell the others to cease their noisy work. They wait patiently behind the door as the other party walk by, disappearing down the same passage the gloomies went. They could hear jangling of weapons, and footsteps definitely heavier than the gloomies'. Perhaps its the Black Bears?<br/><br/>Behind the portcullis the corridor splits in two, and one leads to a room with a dried-out fountain shaped like a leaping fish. As they investigate the room, Jauques puts weight on the fountain base and a poison cloud trap is sprung! Jauques fails his save and takes -10 HP (save or die in the original module). He makes his injury saves, so this is a minor injury: he got clear before inhaling too much of the stuff, but his lungs are messed up and he'll have -2 to anything that requires any sort of stamina for the next few days.<br/><br/>They explore on, and Doggo recognises the next crossroads. There's one passage that also leads to the dragon's den, he claims, and sure enough the hewn stone walls soon give way to a natural cave, damp with moss. They quickly back out and explore the other options. One has a locked door\u2014the first one they've seen with an actual metal lock set into the door. The third leads to a room where the walls and ceiling has settled, and Doggo warns them to walk very slowly and stay silent. They do, and Nameless spots a giant centipede sitting in the ceiling! They don't want to disturb that.<br/><br/>Doggo has promised them that this way leads to clean water, and they are eager to find a water source. (The ravine itself has no water outside of the hot spring, which they daren't drink. The alternatives are either climbing the ravine walls and go exploring the mountainside, or going past the gatehouse again. Both doable, but with their own risks.) Before they get there, they pass through a room with a statue of a bipedal lizard holding a plate full of copper coins! Doggo warns them that it's dangerous, and they inspect the statue closely. Sure enough, the arms and the plate constitute a moving part, probably to spring a trap if the plate is tampered with. They leave the treasure, for now. Across the lizard room lies a small cistern of water. They refill and head back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are two more passages to check before going back to the stairwell. One leads out of the centipede's, but Doggo claims it just leads back to the stairwell by taking the long way around.<br/><br/>The other one is close to the portcullis, and leads to a small shrine. The priest and Nameless start investigating the carvings on the walls, but G. F. Tr\xe1in cuts through the crap and heads for the main attraction: there's a giant stone wheel on the far wall, above the altar, and he immediately spins it. It starts a great racket, and G. F. is hypnotised by the glyphs spinning past. It slows to a stop, with the topmost glyph being a sad figure, sitting down with a dejected posture. He is cursed: he will always have 10 initiative (otherwise 1d20+Wits, and his Wits was 14).<br/><br/>He immediately spins it again! This time it stops on a figure standing tall with a shield. He is blessed with +2 AC. G. F. himself is conflicted: the curse came with an overpowering sensation that this was his just punishment, but the blessing likewise convinced him that it was a blessing he deserved for his deeds. The priest has finished studying the carvings, and deduced that this is a blasphemous shrine to a heathen goddess of Chance. Conrad looks over the glyphs, and count as many "good" as "bad" ones (inasmuch as he interprets the drawings correctly).<br/><br/>Jauques wants to spin the wheel too, but it stops immediately and nothing happens. The others deduce that it is because he is a heathen Gaul; it only works for civilised people. No-one else tries to spin it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is where we were out of time and finished the session. Tune in next time for the session we played today\u2014now with a sixth player!

One such player showed up today, and I essentially told him that we won't stress telling him all the rules since we don't want to slow down, and if a character death of his could be blamed on this, sucks to be you. In return, you get to drop in and out of the game session-to-session. With that said, he picked up quickly and rolled with the punches!<br/><br/>We decided that one of the five Gauls in the gatehouse had reconsidered the dangers of the underground vaults, and thought that with this impressive party they have a chance of making it out with treasure alive! Thus Frank the Frankish shaman (Sage with a bond to a spirit of Light, functionally the spell Light) ran into the party as they passed by the staircase.<br/><br/>They proceed north, and find a wooden signpost pointing warning of the dragon. The passage in question seems to lead to the same natural cave system (they checked their map and the geometry checked out as well). There are several other passages, and Doggo explains that two of them join up farther away and then lead toward the living dead. There's a door, where Doggo claims they store "nasty stuff" that the older gloomies trade with "scary people downstairs" who apparently eat it, maybe? They open the door: it's essentially a morgue, holding several dead, embalmed human bodies (gloomies and otherwise). They hear a squeak, and close the door again.<br/><br/>Another party of gloomies, coming from the north, hails them from the dark. They are upset, telling them that the corpse storage is not their business and they should not open that door! Jauques rolls poorly on his charisma check to ask them for information, so they don't give up anything useful. The party does let them pass, though, and they continue to the south.<br/><br/>During the encounter, the rear guard Conrad notices a person spying at them from behind a corner. He warns the others. I make a note that the Black Bears (that was them) are waiting for a good time to ambush the party, and they will talk to the gloomies who aren't too keen on them either. The party decides to press on.<br/><br/>They decide to investigate "the long way around" just to complete their own map, and in case there's anything on the route that Doggo doesn't think to mention. They pass through two rooms with large bas-relief stone faces. In the first one Doggo leads them across a safe path, warning that some of the floor tiles will trigger the trap. He even shows them the small dart holes in the walls, proudly proclaiming that he helped re-arm this trap once!<br/><br/>Later on, Doggo halts them at an unremarkable point in the corridor, and tells them to proceed pressed against the walls, since there's a pit trap. On the other side, they find a door in the wall while the corridor leads on to what, according to their map, must be the centipede lair. As they investigate the door, however, the gloomies hail them from behind. They ask them to come with them, and leave this place, because they're not allowed here anymore! They approach cautiously, and when the two parties are standing with the pit trap right between them, the gloomies scream a command word. The Black Bear warriors are moving in from the other side, trapping them!<br/><br/>The fight is our longest and bloodiest yet. The Black Bear tribe (physically regular humans) has sent seven warriors, among them two archers. The party only has Jauques, so they decide against a prolonged archery duel and rush the Black Bears. Frank and Conrad stay and guard against the gloomies, who have drawn daggers on the other side of the pit trap.<br/><br/>The fight initially goes badly. Even though the gloomies hold off on crossing the trap, they bind up two of the party who just stand there defending. Jauques takes an arrow to the knee (minor injury, more penalties to physical activities) and G. F. Tr\xe1in gets his left hand cut clean off (major injury). Conrad triggers the trap with a thrown club (since the gloomies know exactly where it is but the party only approximately, a straight-up hole is easier to maneuver around) and then abandons the rear guard to Frank and goes to help against the Black Bears.<br/><br/>The gloomies take their chance now that Frank can't cover both sides of the corridor at once. He's hit by three attacks after his HP runs out, but is still standing! He passes his first injury save (minor injuries), passes the second one with at least four extra degrees of success, so we get our first "actually, it was just a scratch" moment, but then fails the third one for a major injury. Jauques goes to help against the gloomies, fells one, but is then downed himself. A knife to the shoulder, major injury, and as a first in this game he fails the mental injury save meaning he collapses, unconscious from the pain. Soon after, Frank is hit by another savage dagger. He gets is second major injury, and is slain!<br/><br/>But then, their luck changes! As the party fell the fourth Black Bear warrior, they fail their morale check and start running away. This is right before the gloomies would have hit their rear hard. The party doesn't pursue, opting to face the gloomies and scare them away by showing the Black Bear corpses and rolling high Will checks to intimidate. The gloomies scatter immediately, but not after stealing G. F.'s backpack that he had dropped to the ground in order to fight unencumbered.<br/><br/>I roll in secret and determine that the Black Bears fail to keep their wits about them and stir up the giant centipedes, who kill another one of them. The remaining two escape to alert their captain.<br/><br/>The party waits a single turn to wake up Jauques, tourniquet G. F.'s bleeding arm stump, and loot the fallen. They leave Frank's body, and he might be found in the corpse storage if they go there on their next visit <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> The Black Bears carried quite a bit in spare change, so they gather up 29sp and 10cp. The whole encounter was also worth 200 XP (7 Black Bears, 12 gloomies, and 1pit trap, all counting as 1 HD enemies).<br/><br/>Then they head back past the traps and to the stairwell as fast as possible. They hear booming voice of the Old Angry Man echo ahead of them (the two Black Bears that got away are waiting in the room, and have just triggered the enchantment). The Black Bears decide against attacking on their own, and the party never spots them as they rush up, outside.<br/><br/>(part 4 part 2 in the next post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475983/#Comment_475983" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-09T18:35:34+00:00" title="August  9, 2018  6:35PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the injuries are tallied up, we acknowledge that Frank's player has no character, and G. F. Tr\xe1in and Jauques are considered injured to the point of unplayable. They make a plan to head back to Maastricht with what little loot they have, and recruit new adventurers.<br/><br/>We discuss which route they'll be taking and how dangerous it might be, and we agree that no-one is particularly interested in playing out the hex crawl. I offer them a deal: everyone rolls two Strength saves of DC 10, and if you fail either, you die on the way back. For the characters who still had Strength &gt; 10, I said that a natural one gives a -5 (and the value of 1), so Conrad with Str 10 had to roll, but Nameless with Str 14 couldn't fail even on a natural 1. In hindsight I should have made it "you get a major injury on the way back", just on the off chance that the hitherto completely uninjured Conrad had failed those rolls\u2014a little weird to stake immediate death in a game with the "cross" system.<br/><br/>G. F. Tr\xe1in failed his roll! I looked that the random encounter checks I had prepped in case they wanted to play out the journey, and figured he had been slain by wolves. They concocted a story where G. F. Tr\xe1in the One-Handed, ever the fearless leader, had volunteered to hold off two hungry wolves with only a torch while the rest of the party escaped in the night. They came back in the morning, gave him a proper burial and salvaged his gear. Then we cut to Maastricht, dividing the loot and XP.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We debated over shares for dead PCs, and PCs who were only present for part of the adventure. Dan and Father took half a share each, since they had only been in half of the adventure, but we ended up deciding against having dead characters getting either a share of money (classically for their family) or of the XP. I give encounter XP immediately after the encounter, so G. F. took some of that to his grave, but treasure XP was given out here in Maastricht so his share of that one was just split among the survivors.<br/><br/>According to the rules for Guide-type hirelings in LotFP (which is my main reference for spells and price lists), Doggo got 1/10th share of the expedition since he had participated in dangerous events. He didn't get any encounter XP since he just cowered in a corner (though he did pass his loyalty checks; one when they were surrounded and one when 25% of the party went down).<br/><br/>They sold the fire beetle bladders, no longer glowing red but still alchemically interesting, for 15sp. They paid an alchemist (to my surprise they found an alchemist operating in Maastricht, in secret of course\u2014I gave them 1/10 odds that there was one) 10sp to identify the potion they found as a potent healing elixir (mechanically: immediately re-roll HP with advantage, plus regain up to 1d6 points of ability scores due to injuries). They keep it. They also keep the ring, on the chance that it's magic and becomes useful (I hinted at this so there was some meta-gaming here but I don't mind in this instance).<br/><br/>All in all, they cashed in 85sp, and so split 85xp in 4.1 shares, for 21 XP each. The most experienced are Nameless and Conrad, with 100 XP each, meaning that so far encounter XP is actually much more than treasure. However, there are a few treasures in the areas they have explored that would offset this, so essentially they have been unlucky with their searching.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I reminded the players that they now got to choose whether they wanted to go back to the same dungeon or search for another adventure, and they were dead set on returning. The session was close to wrapping but we did another logistics phase and blazed through the travel to the gatehouse with the new party.

Since there is some contact between human surface dwellers and at least the first level of Stonehell, I have replaced most non-human humanoids with more regular humans. For the interested, the gloomies are kobolds in the original module, and the Black Bear tribe are orcs. Their rival gang of goblins, which the players have heard mentioned by the gloomies but not encountered yet, is the Gundar tribe. Both of these tribes speak Gaul natively, although noticeably different dialects from each other and from e.g. Jauques and Frank. (The Gaul exiles in the gatehouse are also goblins originally.)<br/><br/>The language thing has actually been a little tricky, since Stonehell just assumes everyone speaks common for the most part, including in its written messages. What I'm settling on:<br/>- The original builders of Stonehell (at least the upper parts, the prison part) spoke Latin.<br/>- The tribes on the first level are native Gaul speakers, but they don't have a written language so the ones that do write have learned either Latin (if it was a long ago, passed down through generations deal) or Germanic (if they have communicated with the outside world in the last ~100 years). The tribesmen who have outside contact also speak Germanic, but most only speak Gaul.<br/>- The gloomies have their own language, with no writing system. The literate ones know Latin script, since they take care of the dungeon itself and all original text is Latin. A given gloomie speaks (1d6) 1: Gaul, 2: Germanic, 3: Latin, 4: A language used by lower-level denizens, 5: neither, 6: roll twice and take the union. In hindsight it would make sense for the gloomies to have some more writing of their own, but I guess this way there's a bigger chance the party gets to read signs etc which is nice.<br/>- In addition they have found "strange runes" in more than one place. Next session they will have a Gaul magician, and while we have established that there is no "Gaulic written language", they might have good chances of deciphering ancient runes. These runes might be dwarven, elven, fae, lizardfolk, or just pre-Roman Conquest Gaulic, from mostly dead druidic traditions (since this Gaul was partly conquered, then Rome fell, and for some reason we're back to small settlements and nomadic tribes).<br/><br/><br/>So far I'm not at all missing the orcs and kobolds! There might be dwarves coming up soon though, and that'll be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475987/#Comment_475987" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-09T19:11:52+00:00" title="August  9, 2018  7:11PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another note on Stonehell: I mistakenly played the first two sessions under the impression that a standard Stonehell door was made of stone. The players remarked upon the improbable craftsmanship several times, but I was convinced I was just playing the module as written. Then I looked it up and they're supposed to be stout iron-banded wooden doors XD<br/>I debated with myself whether to ret-con this, but I ended up sticking to my guns and I will add a specialised door-making guild among the gloomies (or perhaps some other people on lower levels) who zealously keep up the tradition in the face of impracticality :P<br/><br/>Besides, the thing we found oddest, i.e. the difficulty and time required to open the doors, would't have been less weird with the wooden ones. And that I'm playing as written: just opening a closed door in Stonehell requires an Open Doors check which in standard Labyrinth Lord is used for forcing open locked doors, if I'm reading this correctly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475988/#Comment_475988" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-09T19:24:52+00:00" title="August  9, 2018  7:24PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, when we played this it was also set in the same "fantasy Europe" concept - the GM was also influenced by me (and Jim Raggi, the other guy pushing historical fantasy in D&amp;D hereabouts).<br/><br/>The gloomies were essentially morlocks in our game - human prisoners trapped underground for generations, undergoing dungeon-related adaptations. The dungeon was set in Moldova, Eastern Europe, which brought its own nuances - it had been built by the Byzantine empire in its heyday, for instance. The denizens spoke something nigh-understandable for characters with native Greek, I seem to remember.<br/><br/>I personally like what you're doing in terms of slathering color on the D&amp;D elements, obviously. I've used similar logic in our historical fantasy campaigns a lot, and I feel that it makes the game much more intellectually stimulating for me when I can draw on all these possible connections. Like your Gauls, for instance - much easier to immediately have some ideas for what their magical traditions are like than if it was "Blood Coastians" or something instead.<br/><br/>The door-opening thing you remark upon comes from original D&amp;D - Stonehell is probably belaboring the point because of how that particular rule is usually dropped from later dungeoneering procedures. I think that the original assumption is simply that all doors are indeed stuck - plus probably there's a gaming desire to draw out the timeline and make opening doors costly, and so on; the early game was pretty minimalistic, sometimes they had these rules that make sense if you're not intending to treat the game to a careful exegesis.<br/><br/>If you feel that the 10-minute door opening thing is too gamey over the long term, I suggest developing it in this way: assume that it takes a whole turn "by default". This is how organic rulings often develop in this game: you have a baseline rule that then gets elaborated upon by further detail, but the baseline is still available for whenever you want to default back to something simple and quick. Constructing rules edifices like this requires most of all that the baseline rule is both conservative and simple, which the door-opening rule is, so this seems like a suitable place to apply this principle.<br/><br/>What you might do in practice is to say that the 10 minutes per door opening check is for when the party is working without appropriate tools. Add a big mallet and spikes and a crowbar and an axe and whatever else, and suddenly it's going much faster. This admittedly doesn't do anything about the fact that you'd expect regularly used doors (such as the gloomies use) to not get stuck all the time, but that might be something you can't eliminate without starting to randomize the stuckyness status of individual doors. (That's something I've liked to do: a simple 50% chance per door in dungeon that it's stuck, otherwise it works fine as long as it's not locked.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475989/#Comment_475989" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-09T19:42:51+00:00" title="August  9, 2018  7:42PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm reading along, but don't have much to add just yet.

So Jauques never even came with the others to Maastricht, but we ruled that if both he and them got home safely, he'd get his share of XP for salvaging treasures back "to civilisation" anyway. Alas, some druid or other has pronounced a prophecy that one of his family must brave Stonehell dungeon, so now that Jauques failed the task the family sent his sister instead. They have more children, so this player has her character background status situated.<br/><br/>Dan the Fighter is now known as Halvdan (Half-Dan) since he's just half the man he once was after taking that skeleton's blade. He was taken in by the monks at a monastery in Maastricht, and will likely stay there for a long time before attempting the journey back to his homeland, not to mention any more adventuring.<br/><br/>Conrad was uninjured, but still reconsidered his choices and stayed in Maastricht. (The player never stated the OOC motivation explicitly but I think he wanted to try out another class, since he rolled up Bothrun the magician.<br/><br/>"Lillesippa Besv\xe4raren" is an great pun in Swedish, that I wasn't able to translate.<br/><br/><br/>The party gets the same deal as the original one: skip through the haggling over boat rides, and start by the fallen bridge down one ration. Ren\xe9e meets them at the bridge as well, after a days travel from her family's camp. Nameless makes pathfinding with advantage since she's followed this exact overgrown road before recently. They make good time and arrive at the gatehouse in less than two days. The only encounter was the dead body of an elf, apparently slain in combat and dumped in a ditch stripped of everything but his clothes. No-one has seen an elf for real before, but the pointy ears and fair features are unmistakable. Father gives him a proper burial (Ren\xe9e, the heathen, speculates that the elf might not have wanted a Christian burial but doesn't interfere) after Lillesippa has claimed his cool green tunic.<br/><br/>They pass through the gatehouse with caution, and just as they emerge from the other side they are hailed from a second-storey window by the remaining Gauls. They were sleeping when the party left a week ago, so they had assumed they had died in the dungeon. Out of the ones who parlayed with them last time, only Nameless remains, but they manage to convince them that they gave the agreed toll to Frank (who you'll recall did die in the dungeon) who took off with it. They strike the same deal again: if they emerge with any treasure, they are to pay a toll before leaving the ravine. Yeah, yeah, says Nameless.<br/><br/>Last time they had asked about exploring the southern half of the gatehouse, where the Gauls didn't go because it was haunted. This time they just assumed it would still be okay, since Father was concerned about the eternal souls of the poor restless dead. They find two essentially empty rooms, and the room with the arrow slits through Conrad had seen a ghost way back in part 1. They do indeed find ghosts: five adventurers, just sitting down, walking around, talking inaudibly to each other. The ghosts at first don't notice the party, and when Lillesippa tries greeting them they react as if she is the hardly-visible ghost. They even walk right through her, for 1 HP damage, without taking notice at all! The bones of the adventurers lie scattered about the room, and Father resolves to bury them.<br/><br/>They dare to explore the second floor, hoping that when the Gauls said they avoid "the south side" they meant both floors. They emerge from a staircase into a large room, perhaps an old mess hall, where a nest of stirges immediately attack them. They slay the three flying critters, (30 XP) but decide against trying to make hats out of them. They also find a dead woman, a traveller or adventurer, who kept a small hidden pouch with 10sp and a 50sp ruby! Already a haul almost as great as the previous expedition's!<br/><br/>The door to the next room has cobwebs on it, so Nameless takes the chance that they do not violate the Gauls' territory. The room has a hole in the roof, some broken furniture, and a weakened wooden floor due to the leaking roof. Nothing of value is found, and they daren't go further.<br/><br/>(part 5 part 2 in the next post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476013/#Comment_476013" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T17:34:08+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  5:34PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Next, Nameless gets to be a sort of tour guide. "Over there is the refrigerator room where we saw the skeletons, there's the hot spring..." Some of the players have a heavy completionist streak, but none of them takes a leader role this time\u2014a combination of people being tired, and Nameless being the natural leader in-game while her player isn't that decisive. So they end up milling around the ravine for most of the session, trying this and that, with the overarching idea of exploring everything else before going down the stairs again.<br/><br/>They bury the ghosts' bones, which gives them 50 XP. I don't actually give XP for restless souls given solace, but the ghosts where technically listed as monsters which I judged equivalent to 1 HD (they even scared them before), and burying them was the only thing that really would have counted as "overcoming" them. They didn't get any XP for burying the elf or the non-haunting woman.<br/><br/>They examine the "refrigerator", and see that the skeletons they destroyed last time have been re-reanimated! This time they send the two ranged fighters\u2014Bothrun with a bow and ren\xe9e with a sling\u2014in to lure them out, while everyone else lies in ambush just outside the door. Father also takes the time to ask for the Lord's blessing on their conquest against undead, which gave four of them +1 to all relevant rolls and +1 damage against these lesser undead (extra effects after the +1 to rolls are negotiated based on the caster level and "level" of the undead). The tactic pays off, and all 6 skeletons are knocked down at essentially no cost! (60 XP)<br/><br/>Lillesippa is so impressed by the Lord's blessing that she immediately abandons her dreams of becoming a barbarian warrior, and decides she's a holy paladin now.<br/><br/>Father manages to read some of the carvings in the skeleton chamber: they talk about a curse over these people, to never find rest and remain in agony for all eternity. He buries the skeletons as well, in the hope that they will not rise again. They make the foes' own rusty sword into crosses to mark the graves. While the adults toil, Lillesippa tries her hand at cooking the stirges for lunch.<br/><br/>They then brave the hot pool, with both Nameless and Lillesippa going for a swim and trying to examine the metal place at the bottom. Nameless tries to swim down but doesn't make it, and Lillesippa drops a rusty sword on it to no effect.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>They finally decide to investigate the switchback trail leading up the south side of the ravine, and then come back, set up camp, and brave the dungeon on the morrow. The switchback trail passes close to two natural caves, and then leads over a ridge. Nameless spots smoke as if from a campfire rising to the sky beyond that ridge. They check the caves first.<br/><br/>The first opening leads to a small system of caves, where they encounter and slay both a giant crab spider (20 XP) and two giant centipedes (20 XP). Father actually tripped and fell when battling the centipedes, and got bitten twice before his comrades Schvuu and Lillesippan slay the critters. As the poison spreads through his body (two save or die i.e. 10 HP damage leading to an injury save) he quickly produces the small flask they found on their last trip here. It counteracts the poison with a burning sensation throughout his veins, and he gets up without a scratch. Truly miraculous! But now it's gone. The caves also contain a small stash of 94cp, and some cave wall paintings that might be of gloomie origin.<br/><br/>The second cave mouth is a wolf's den, but I need only tell Nameless' player "going by the smell, some sort of large animal must live here" and she turns the party around. She has bad memories of the black bear last time. (The module actually just says the wolves are here, in which case they would have attacked as soon as she approached, but I gave the party small odds that they were out hunting and the party got lucky.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The final stop is to go over the crest and look for the fire. They follow the trail for a while, until they no longer see the ravine behind them, and finally spot smoke rising from among the underbrush. They deduce that it must be a chimney going up from a cave, but they can't see an entrance around here. (It was a bit further down the path, hidden, so they might have found it if they had pressed on.) They go off the path and find the chimney; the crude work of an amateur mason. They decide to write "Good day" on a flat stone with the flame chalk and throw it down. Whoever's down there responds by dousing the fire, and the party hides around the area. Sure enough, 7 brigands soon appear from the path. <br/><br/>Ren\xe9e decides to hail them, rolling well on her charisma while the brigands get a friendly reaction roll. The gist of their interaction is that a band brigands who call themselves the Ghost Beggars live here, and Ren\xe9e and her gang are welcome to go into Stonehell but don't come up here again or else. Some of the brigands have been down there, and they recognise Doggo as being a gloomie. The party quietly assumes the brigands will try to backstab them as they emerge with treasures, of course, but everyone plays nice for now. Just as they're parting ways, a brigand tells Lillesippan "nice tunic"; hinting that it was these guys who slew the elf yesterday.<br/><br/>I don't think I gave them XP for this encounter; I doubted whether it ticks the "predisposed towards hostility towards the characters" box that my rules has for considering them a threat. In hindsight it definitely did\u2014they had their weapons readied when Ren\xe9e started talking. I might settle this next session if I remember.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>They check out the northern chambers to see if they're still safe camping site. I roll on a table to see if a new monster has taken up lodging there. I roll the black bear encounter from the table, but it's a unique encounter and that bear already has a lair, so I judge that it's just been spending some time there recently. They don't search too carefully, so they don't notice the stray fur and droppings. If they leave anything in the camp, it'll be trashed by the bear when they come back, and there'll be a 1 in 6 chance that it's chilling there when they come back.<br/><br/>They divvy up the night watch, and during Schvuu's watch a flock of stirges close in on them, hoping to prey on the blood of sleeping humans. Schvuu wakes everyone up, they prepare an ambush and roll initiative with advantage. All but one stirge go down before they get to act in the first round, and no-one takes any damage. (50 XP) They postpone the expedition start one hour in order to get everyone well-rested despite the interrupted sleep.<br/><br/>(part 5 part 3 in the next post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476014/#Comment_476014" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T17:39:42+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  5:39PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the morning, Bothrun and Ren\xe9e prepare their spells (<i>Enlarge</i> and a <i>Knock/Hold Portal</i> combo, respectively) while Lillesippan barbecues stirges for breakfast and Father prays for the Lord's blessing upon their quest to scour the vaults of the undead. The players seem more keen on tackling the dragon, but it never hurts to be prepared! Our ruling for spell slots: preparing takes two hours; neither that nor casting requires a roll; you can re-prep spells during the day but that counts as a short rest for fatigue purposes (disadvantage HD next short rest).<br/><br/><br/><br/>They go down, and decide to try the locked door now that they have a spell for it. On the way there they open the regular Stonehell doors with a crowbar they had brought. For now I'm going with a variant of Krippler's rule: first check is very fast if it succeeds, subsequent checks take 10 minutes each. The crowbar gave them advantage on the roll. They pass through the room with the booming magic voice, and hearing the warning repeated verbatim they deduce that there's no bite to this particular magic trap's bark. They also pass by the poison cloud fountain, which Lillesippan almost touches before Nameless warns her that it almost killed old Jauques last time.<br/><br/>I wrote that casting doesn't take a roll generally, but the Knock version of Ren\xe9e's spell is a Will check where regular closed doors are DC 5, Stonehell stubborn doors are DC 10, and locked doors are 15 or higher depending on the condition and sophistication of the lock. She rolled 15, and I realised I hadn't committed to a DC for the door beforehand. I wavered and ruled that 15 was enough to get the lock open, but that the door was still stuck like a regular door. Since the door was actually sealed away for a reason by craftsmen who knew their stuff, and in pretty good condition, it probably should have been 20 for that result. Well well.<br/><br/>They are greeted with moldy dust, and see a series of crypt doors with Latin carvings: names and dates. They all date from around A.D. 600\u2014the current year is A.D. 1214. They break one open and Ren\xe9e and Schvuu start searching the six corpses lain to rest inside. They don't get far before one on a high shelf rolls over and drapes itself over Ren\xe9e\u2014it's a zombie and it tries to bite her face! Lillesippa manages to get it off her and throw it out into the corridor, where Nameless cuts it down. The Lord's blessing came in handy today too!<br/><br/><br/><br/>We called time and ended the session, with 7 more crypts and one other door left undisturbed. We'll pick off right here come Monday. However, Lillesippa's player (the guest) won't be able to join. We'll decide then what to do with Lillesippa, but she'll either be demoted to a hireling, or she decides she wants to be a robber who lives in a cave (she thought that was so cool) and run off to join the Ghost Beggars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite a general feeling of not much progress, this must have been the most lucrative single session. They racked up 42 XP each from encounters\u2014that's almost a third of Nameless' total so far\u2014<i>and</i> found treasures worth 69.4sp. On the other hand, they generally rolled well, and their one major setback was mitigated by spending their <i>potion of extra-healing</i> (whose effect in my game I made up without looking up what it did in LL :P ).<br/><br/><br/>The Ghost Beggars are introduced by name in the supplement Stonehell: The Brigand Caves; in the original module they are just "brigands" who show up around the ravine and have a base nearby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476017/#Comment_476017" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T18:00:20+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  6:00PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Some thoughts on restocking dungeons</b><br/><br/>It's been just over a week since their last foray, so I now have the weekend to get to work re-stocking the explored rooms of the dungeon as much as I like. The module has a table: (1d6) 1: monster, 2: monster and treasure, 3\u20136: nothing visible; on 1 in 6 a hidden treasure. It's a nice little table, but it seems slightly off to me in that it doesn't account for the passage of time. Returning after two months is different from returning after a week. On the other hand, returning after two months should realistically require not only re-stocking the dungeon but also changing many of the original undiscovered (or undisturbed) descriptions, since they are transient by nature. And I don't want to have to do that\u2014I can't be arsed to extrapolate all undiscovered levels (currently 2\u201310) forward a week every time they go back to town!<br/><br/>Of course, it's possible to just say that the description in the module is for "when the players get there". Now if the players get to level 2 after being away for a week, we retroactively decide that if (counterfactually) the players had got there last time, they would have found rooms that were extrapolated one week <i>back</i> in time from the description in the module.<br/><br/>I am worrying a bit about the rivalry between the Black Bear and the Gundar though. In the module, the Gundar have "recently" been almost wiped out, and the remaining ones are preparing an imminent kamikaze attack on the Black Bears. The players don't know much, but the gloomies did tell of another tribe that used to live there but was chased out now. I now have to go through the rest of level 1 and choose: either decide that the Gundar were slower in their revenge than the module implies, and it hasn't happened yet (some rooms might be changed), or decide that it did happen (lots of rooms might change, and its hard to not view the strategic new landscape as less interesting, since there are fewer moving parts). I'll most likely go with the former this time, but if they leave the dungeon once more with still only having heard of the Gundar, they'll sort of force my hand. Such is the double-edged sword of simulation I guess: in order to make the simulation feel real, the default tool is to put in the work running the simulation even when the players aren't looking!<br/><br/><br/>Such musings aside, it still requires some imagination and a lot of judgment calls to re-stock the discovered rooms while keeping the rest of the dungeon in mind. For this first substantial re-stocking (I didn't do it before today's session, and they only passed through a few rooms so I'll get away with it) I will use the table as written on all discovered rooms that are neither trapped, regularly patrolled by the Black Bear tribe, or otherwise has a purpose which the adventurers didn't alter (i.e. the corpse storage). The tables for the area they have explored will almost only yield Black Bears, gloomies and wildlife anyway, and those are easy enough to slot in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476022/#Comment_476022" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T19:46:24+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  7:46PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff!

The amount of time elapsed tells me how *thorough* or far-reaching the action might be.<br/><br/>For instance, I might know that the ogres in the dungeon wish to capture and enslaves the troglodytes. If that's the determined monster action, in one day they might just capture one, but after a month or a year they might enslave the entire tribe and build pens to keep them in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476024/#Comment_476024" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T20:38:07+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  8:38PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It occurs to me that it might be interesting to make use of random encounter tables to see who else happens upon the dungeon and to generate outcomes from there.

Has that been an issue with your players, or do you think they will keep playing it smart and clearing small sections at a time?"<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I understand what you mean. Do you mean that there are often some routes with doors blocking, and some without, so you could potentially go across half the level without opening a door if you go by the "path of least resistance"? That's true in places I guess. My players definitely try to assess which way is more dangerous, pros and cons of different routes to the same place etc. If they have a goal, like when Doggo told them they were headed for the water, they most likely would have gone through doors to get there even if there were easy-access corridors nearby. Sometimes during the ten minutes someone's working on a door, someone else says "I take one of the torches and go a little ways down this hallway, just to see what's there". They've never split the party.<br/><br/>Putting aside the immersion-breaking gamey-ness of it, the 10-minute door checks are a great wrinkle in the exploration game. I don't track exploration speed, instead just eyeballing both travel distance and discussions and eventually go "yeah, it's been 10 minutes", mark the time, and roll a wandering monster check. I usually don't even tell them this; they know I roll for shit now and then and they knew from the start they wouldn't be able to track time accurately in the dark anyway. But most of the times I mark a turn passed it's due to an open doors check or searching a place thoroughly.<br/><br/>They have caught on to "time passing -&gt; bad" now and I think they factor in both the time and the noise of opening doors into their decision-making. If there are two corridors and the one they explore first ends in a door, they might well backtrack and check the other one at least some 20'-50' down before bashing in the first door. If the second corridor ends in a room without a door, I'm sure they will poke their heads and torches in and look around before opting to go back. I don't see this as a problem.<br/><br/><br/>Aside: It's funny, I gave out the Old-School Primer as inspirational reading when putting the group together, but I definitely use search rolls\u2014straight up "say how high you rolled and I'll say what you find". I often take into account how they're searching, and there's this continual back-and-forth of precedence-setting where we're establishing how they're usually searching if they don't say anything else. When searching the fountain room, they said "we search the room", I asked if they were investigating the fountain or just the walls, they said "of course the fountain" and I just decided that Jauques had put weight on the fountain's base (in order to get closer) and triggered the trap. I guess in my head I try to separate it: stuff you couldn't miss if you look for it, I tell them if they say that they look there, no roll: if you say you look up, I say there's a spider there, if it's just sitting there. But stuff that you could legitimately miss, even when searching, that's a Wits check. And the thing is: against uneven backgrounds, in the dark with only flickering torchlights, you could miss a lot of things. They said they were investigating the statue for mechanisms, but I think it's feasible to miss the small seam by the arm-joint on a bad roll, under those conditions. Besides, since they roll searches in the open, they can notice out-of-game that their highest roll was a 12 and that's not very high, so let's spend another turn searching. Let them use more time if they want to, I say. Similarly, they haven't tried yet, but I think even the total amateurs that they are could have picked that lock with enough tries. If they could survive four hours worth' of wandering monster checks, that is...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476026/#Comment_476026" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-10T21:27:43+00:00" title="August 10, 2018  9:27PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: that "monster actions" idea for restocking is great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476031/#Comment_476031" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-11T04:09:15+00:00" title="August 11, 2018  4:09AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!<br/><br/>I find it useful in a number of ways, because it forces me to think about what the monsters want and what they might be doing, what weak or strong points the dungeon itself might have, and so forth.<br/><br/>All that brainstorming is really handy for giving the dungeons and it's inhabitants life, in a very economical way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476067/#Comment_476067" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-12T12:23:58+00:00" title="August 12, 2018 12:23PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I never realized that the Ghost Beggars are from the Stonehell material - when playing this stuff I thought it was something unrelated placed by the GM in the sandbox.

If the PCs leave them exactly as is, maybe I will. But there's a good chance the PCs will anger, weaken or otherwise affect one of the sides before they leave this time.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476074/#Comment_476074" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-12T20:06:39+00:00" title="August 12, 2018  8:06PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I re-read some early posts in the thread:<br/>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero" rel="nofollow">Eero</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It's very cool, and if you don't mind I might link people to this write-up on occasion to give a quick rundown of how we play old school D&amp;D here.</p></div></blockquote>\nI don't think I ever answered you, but of course!

(And still, the very first check at a new door only takes 1 minute, pass or fail\u2014close to Krippler's kicking rule.)<br/><br/><br/>We also adopted these ritual magic rules:<br/><br/>A spell is a skill, i.e. going from 0% to 100%. Sages with the "Goetia" Initiation start with 100% in one random spell, other than that no-one has any positive numbers from start.<br/><br/>Anyone can try to cast a spell they know as a ritual. This requires:<br/>- 1 hour per spell level<br/>- a Knowledge check DC 20 modified by the skill value<br/>- a Will check DC 20 modified by the skill value<br/>i.e. the ability score is multiplied by the skill value: 1d20+(Knowledge*Skill)<br/>Some spells have a check as a part of their effect; the above checks are in addition.<br/><br/>Anyone with Goetia can also prepare spells in their mind. This requires:<br/>- 2 hours<br/>- No checks (except checks that are part of the effect)<br/>- A d% roll under the skill value when casting the spell, or it whiffs\u2014possibly with minor cosmetic effects, but nothing useful nor dangerous<br/><br/>Preparing your spells costs 2 hours flat, even for higher-level casters who have several spell slots. I'm not 100% clear on spell slots yet, but I figure 1 per level is a good start. Preparing spells also counts as a short rest for fatigue purposes (except for when doing it first thing in the morning, before any adventuring).<br/><br/>As for learning new spells: a character with Goetia has a spellbook or equivalent that contains their collected notes on magic\u2014not just instructions for specific spells (those are a smaller part of actual text). They can learn (and transcribe) spells from other spellbooks or similar documents/artifacts. Again, I don't have standard DCs set up but I figure it will vary wildly, from "meticulous notes written by a wise master intended for his students" to "mad scrawlings in a cave". In any case, Goetia allows self-study, to pretty quickly get a few percentage points in the new spell, and then gradually build it up.<br/><br/>For characters without Goetia (or a similar Initiation), the ritual option is there if they manage to learn a spell. However, they pretty much can't do it without active instruction from someone else.<br/><br/><br/>Part 6 coming soon\u2014with more deaths!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476087/#Comment_476087" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T17:21:54+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  5:21PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 6: The Living Dead<br/><br/><br/>We last left our heroes by a crypt, where they had defeated a zombie. They search the room it came from, but only find corpses and rotten linen. Lillesippa decides she doesn't enjoy dungeon crawling after all, and wants to go be a robber instead (her player won't come back for the rest of the campaign). We demote her to a hireling for the time being and say that next time you pass near the stairs to the surface, she'll just leave.<br/><br/>They opt not to open the other crypts, and instead go for the door at the end of the corridor. They read the Latin inscriptions\u2014it's excerpts from Christian prayers for the salvation of the souls laid to rest. However, the large cross engraved on the door has been altered: someone has extended it upwards to form an upside-down cross. They force open the door.<br/><br/>Inside is a small altar chamber, with Christian imagery but also a preoccupation with death (skulls and bones abound in the relief carvings). They search the room, and Nameless realises as she touches it that the altar is cursed! She quickly backs away, making her save, and feel the tenuous grasp of the evil forces begrudgingly let her go. Since no-one opts to touch the altar, they never get to see what the effects of the curse would have been. They also don't find the secret room hidden to the side.<br/><br/>They debate whether the other crypts are likely to hold any treasure, but they are disparaged by Father. He wants to lay living dead to rest as much as anyone, but robbing the graves of honourably buried Christians sits ill with him. They recall that there is another part of the dungeon which Doggo said held "the Living Dead" and that they could try their luck over there. Perhaps they were more obviously blasphemers or heathens, Ren\xe9e hopes, so that Father won't have qualms about looting them.<br/><br/>They take the long way around the dragon caves, and pass the pit trap where the battle took place last time. They investigate the door that they never had time to open then, and find a cluttered storeroom. Almost everything is in useless condition, including heaps of rotten firewood, but they grab a hammer and 6 large iron nails.<br/><br/>As they pass the corridor with the ogre-mouth relief vaults, Lillesippa bids farewell and heads for the stairs. She'll be found among the Ghost Beggars if the players go there, but won't take an active role in anything if it would make a difference to her viability as a returning PC. The remaining five (Nameless, Schvuu, Ren\xe9e, Bo\xfer\xfan and Father) head west, as Doggo leads them toward the dwelling of the Living Dead\u2014that is, these totally different Living Dead that he told them about before.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They pass a new door that they haven't tried, and stop to investigate. Inside is a giant stone sculpture of a bearded human head. As they look around, it starts emitting steam from its mouth and its eyes start glowing. It speaks with the same voice as the magical warning south of the staircase. It tells them it has been placed here to answer their questions; it will answer three.<br/><br/>Schvuu immediately asks: "where's the treasure?" It answers "Beware the caves, for there be the dragon!"<br/><br/>After mulling it over, they ask "What's the dragon's weakness?" It answers "When meeting the dragon, keep your head up!* Then pierce its flesh with metal."<br/><br/>*Untranslatable; in Swedish the phrase "watch out" literally reads "look up".<br/><br/>Finally, they ask "Will we survive this?" It answers "To get out of here alive, just remember: never put your right foot in front of your left foot." Having answered three questions, the mouth stops smoking and the eyes stop glowing.<br/><br/>(The oracle gives 1\u20132: the truth, 3\u20134: falsehood, 5\u20136: one of 6 pre-written cryptic responses. The first answer was a cryptic response, which they took to be a hint that the dragon has treasure\u2014which happens to be true! The second answer was truth\u2014the "dragon", actually a giant gekko, has no particular weakness, but it sometimes hides in the ceiling so looking up could help them. The third answer was falsehood; I didn't know whether they would survive so I gave them nonsense. Even if they had followed it, and happened to live, the causality implied by the statement would still not be true.)<br/><br/><br/>During their questioning, the rear guard Bo\xfer\xfan notices the unmistakable chatter of gloomies down the corridor to the south. She alerts the others, but by the time they are done with the stone head the gloomies have vanished. They investigate a room where there are soot silhouettes of people on the walls\u2014very foreboding. This is where the gloomies spotted them from, but they are gone now. The players haven't explored enough to know that the silhouette room is connected to another area they think is behind them. The gloomies know this, and have headed that way to encircle them.<br/><br/>They keep heading west toward the Living Dead. They find the oracle's responses too cryptic to trust the stuff about the dragon to be true. They pass a room that bears mark of an old battle, and then they hear the gloomies behind them again. They don't know it, but they are trapped\u2014the way ahead has a particularly sturdy door (DC 25 compared to the regular 20) and the gloomies block off the way back. Some of the gloomies approach with drawn weapons.<br/><br/>Ren\xe9e tries asking them what they want. One of the gloomies speak Gaul (this time determined randomly\u2014this party actually had exactly one each who speaks Gaul, Germanic and Latin, respectively), and answers that they are not welcome here. It's unclear if they recognise Nameless and Father from last time, or if everyone's unwelcome now. Ren\xe9e's charisma check does bring down their aggression a notch, and like all gloomies they are cowards. They make a deal: keep going forward, into the dwelling of the Living Dead, and never come back. That's not much of a deal, someone says. Doesn't matter, those are the terms. The party shrugs\u2014they were headed there anyway, and they figure they can deal with the gloomies when they come back.<br/><br/>They inspect the large double doors, adorned with relief carvings of a literal <i>dance macabre</i>. They open it with relative ease (money well spent, that crowbar). A smell of dust and old death meets them.<br/><br/><br/>(part 6 part 2 in a separate comment)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476089/#Comment_476089" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T17:47:39+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  5:47PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a tricky situation.

Doggo is scared, but Father's stoic calm helps him cope. They reach a large room, with ruined sculptures and two rows of pillars stretching out into the dark. (There are also exits forward, left and right.) But it's not all dark: six fire beetles are grazing on the lichen growing here. The party readies their weapons; this enemy was easy enough last time, and provided them with long-lasting torches of improved fire safety. Doggo recognises them: they're a staple of the Stonehell dwellers' diet.<br/><br/>The beetles go down without incident (60 XP). The players are doing their best to allow the two ranged fighters clear shots, and both Schvuu and Nameless are using their shields more actively (pay 2 initiative to make a defence roll, which supersedes your AC if it's better). Nameless takes one carcass and demonstrates how to extract the glowing organs, and then they get to work on one each in the interest of speed. Ren\xe9e flubs her Knowledge roll, puncturing the glands and spilling hot, glowing slime on the floor. They also decide to take some culinary chances, and cut up the beetles for rations.<br/><br/>(Here, I rolled for random encounters during the hour or so they spend here, and got several. However, we had already went through the whole process, so I may have been a bit biased in my interpretation of the tables towards results that would likely result in discrete breaks in their work, so that it could be resumed afterwards without too much hassle. In hindsight, I would have liked to say "you know what, strike everything after Nameless demonstrated the gland extraction; you're interrupted by zombies; we'll re-roll whatever you thought you had done afterwards if you still want to do it".)<br/><br/>First, they noticed a stream of ants ("insect swarm" on the table) pouring out of a crack in the wall, headed for the dead beetle Father's working on. They quickly switch it for Ren\xe9e's, whose glands were already ruined, and write it off as acceptable losses. The ants don't venture further into the room, and the party don't bother them. I forgot to give them XP, but the ants weren't out to hurt them anyway.<br/><br/>Next, they hear shuffling steps coming from the north corridor. They line up next to the doorway and the rangers take their shots as soon as the zombies shuffle into the light of their torches. Then Nameless, Schvuu and Ren\xe9e hold the corridor. Nameless drops to 0 HP and takes a minor injury\u2014a zombie tears a nasty gash along her arm with its fingernails\u2014so Father tags her out. There were 6 zombies but the party effectively keep it a 3-vs-2 by blocking the corridor (more nimble opponents would have been able to squeeze their own front rank, making it 3-vs-3). When the zombies are down to 3, they retreat into the room so all 5 members of the party can surround the zombies and get their hits in. Other than Nameless' flesh wound, no-one is hurt. Of course, they are helped by the fact that Father and Nameless still have all actions taken to scour the vaults of the undead blessed by the Lord. (120 XP)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>They wash the wound, and finish up with the beetle butchering. I roll up 3 cobras on the wandering monsters table, and my credulity is strained. What are they doing here? Why would they attack? If they live here, why wouldn't they had attacked earlier? Why would they want to eat the beetles\u2014they eat much smaller animals, right? In hindsight I probably could have gone for "driven mad by the chaos energies of this godforsaken, evil place", but I didn't. I set the cobras to a 5 for "Hunting for sport" on my morale/loyalty table:<br/><br/>2\tTraitorous, pressured into service, forced into service but no risk of enforcement<br/>3-4\tCowardly, forced into service and enforcer close<br/>5-6\tFickle, underpaid, protecting, hunting for sport<br/>7-9\tNormal pay, protecting territory or superiors, hunting for food<br/>8-9\tGood pay, protecting home or friends, hunting for food while starving<br/>10-11\tWell paid and emotionally invested, protecting own life or way of life<br/>12\tMindless, zealous, parent protecting young<br/><br/>And then I rolled higher than 5 on 2d6 and they decided not to attack the large scary humans. (No XP\u2014not sure if they should have been, by my rules.)<br/><br/><br/>The party moves north, to investigate the origin of the zombies. There are two empty rooms here, one of which is a mausoleum, and I had decided to myself that this is where they came from (when I had to choose which way they were approaching from). However, I forget that this should mean that the door would be open, so they just pass by the closed door. To my luck, the map has a small walled-up room nearby, the size of a supply closet, that has been broken open from the inside. The players deduce that's where the zombies were, and move on. I retroactively accept this explanation as better than mine.<br/><br/>They enter a room full of unlit candles\u2014some sort of memorial hall. Schvuu finds a secret door in the corner, leading through a narrow passage out into a corridor. They don't know it, but they're actually very close to the beetle room; this corridor meets up with the eastern exit. They happen to go in the other direction, though, and come to a set of doors, one at each side of the corridor. They force one open, and find a large crypt. To large sarcophagi, and numerous shelves and alcoves filled with embalmed corpses. Ren\xe9e got her wish: the place is largely non-denominational, and she starts looking for treasure. (Father is not completely happy, but doesn't stop her.) Just as she opens a ceramic urn to find it full of silver coins, three of the dead awaken as zombies! Typical.<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan gets bitten in the arm, but other than that they make quick work of the opposition (60 XP). (Father's and Nameless' blessings will stay until sunrise the next day, and though the party has lost track of time, it's only just before noon.) They search the remaining grave offering urns, and tally up a total of 200 silver pieces! They divide this windfall evenly at once, to spread the risk and the encumbrance penalties.

Major injuries are definitely my number one source of insecurity in this game so far: what am I allowed to do? How worse can it get? How soft can I go, so that the previous guy doesn't think it unfair? Today I brought out the "body part hit" table from Swedish simulationism strawman RPG Eon, third edition, and happened to roll the lower arm for both of them. When using a table in order to remove culpability for improvisation, I can't very well improvise a new interpretation of the very same roll, so it had to be "arm cut off" the second time as well! Tomorrow I'll look over the corresponding critical hits tables more closely and see if I can get a better procedure that I'm still comfortable with using.) They have every chance to retreat, but just as they are on the verge of giving up Ren\xe9e hits a Wits check to realise that the current wave of skeletons is the last one. They kill the last one\u2014now having destroyed 10 skeletons over many rounds\u2014and tend to their wounded.<br/><br/>(The voice from the darkness before was not a skeleton, but the cursed leper Malfreces Nul, who commands the undead here but has no particular ambitions of his own. He just sicced the skeletons on them and then went about his business.)<br/><br/>We debate the viability of achieving effective tourniquets for our new amputees, and though the prolonged combat already makes it unrealistic we allow Bo\xfer\xfan and Nameless to roll for it (Knowledge check modified by their Medicine skills of 75% and 10%, respectively). Both fail, and we agree that while the details aren't important, both Schvuu and Father bleed to death within minutes.<br/><br/>Doggo is beside himself with grief, and now no-one can speak with him either (he speaks only Gloom-tongue and Latin). Ren\xe9e, with the help of a decent Charisma roll, manages to get across the point that they will bring him up to the surface to bury him. No-one has anywhere close the encumbrance budget to carry a corpse, so they stash Father and Schvuu, with their respective gear, each in a sack and start dragging.<br/><br/>Amazingly, they make it all the way to the staircase without random encounters. The gloomies have not been waiting for them outside the entrance to the dwellings of the Living Dead, presumably having better things to do. Rest assured, the Black Bears are aware of the party's return now at least. They need as many hands as they can to get the corpses up the long stairs, so they leave Bo\xfer\xfan to guard the late Schvuu while Doggo, Ren\xe9e and Nameless get Father to the surface.<br/><br/>Again they get lucky, and Bo\xfer\xfan's vigil is uninterrupted for the 30 minutes it takes until Nameless and Ren\xe9e come back down, having left Doggo to guard / weep for Father. But finally, their luck runs out, and I roll a random encounter as their getting Schvuu up the stairs. As they reach the top of the stairs, they found Doggo slain by two arrows, Father's body bag torn open and his body looted. Lucky they split up that treasure beforehand\u2014now they only lost one share!<br/><br/>(The encounter was "brigands". I decided that while they have their own entrance into Stonehell from their cave base, they are unlikely to have walked through the dungeon all the way to the staircase, since they also have access to these stairs from the surface. So to be encountered by the stairs, they must have had business here, and if they had been down there, returning to the stairs, they would have noticed the corpse-draggers way before since Bo\xfer\xfan had been guarding the stairs for some time. The logical conclusion was that the brigands just got here from the ravine, and as such they had run into Doggo first. Alas, poor Doggo. Rest in piece.)<br/><br/><br/>Upon this sorry sight, we end the session. I ask the survivors to make their customary end-of-session ability score improvement rolls, and Ren\xe9e's player exclaims "what's even the point, now?". A good session all around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476092/#Comment_476092" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T19:00:55+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  7:00PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 7:03PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hah, I knew they'd get fucked up by Malfreces Nul. Respect for sticking to the process and letting those characters bleed to death after combat amputation.<br/><br/>Regarding major injuries, my suggested heuristic is this: "As per traditional D&amp;D rules procedure, your character should just die here, right now. The rolls and routines we have already done are what the vast majority of the tradition holds sufficient for a character to die. However, I prefer a system that simulates the horrible, more or less career-ending injuries that may occur in between a character being basically-fine and them being dead as a doornail, and I choose to place those possibilities here, at the limit of death. Therefore, I ask you now: will we just leave this character dead, or shall I pronounce on their wounds with more specificity? You will get what first occurs to me, no takebacks, no negotiation - this is a dead man walking, if they indeed are after this injury. If you think that you would not enjoy playing a dying man in his death throes, then we can just call it done and move on."<br/><br/>(That's roughly how I explain the "wounds and crosses" stuff to the players. The question about whether the player wants the death or the wound is also standard procedure; most of the time the players want the wound, probably because they're rarely sensitive enough to dread macabre description of violence, and because they are hoping against hope that this time the wound might be a survivable one. Sometimes it sort of is, and the character can come back later almost as good as new. This is of course particularly true when the wound has been caused by something relatively safe, such as a boxing match or accidental fall.)<br/><br/>That is to say, I find it useful to consider the assignation of major wounds an explicit inspired GM privilege. Monsters <i>die</i> when they take a major wound, remember? Major wounds only occur when a player explicitly asks for their character to live on. Often the wound is career-ending, or proves deadly in consequence. There is no fairness or game balance or simulation here, all that already happened before. The GM shouldn't feel constrained by careful procedure any longer at this stage, I think.<br/><br/>The main advantage aside from emotional security (the GM's, I mean - it's a harsh job having to pronounce characters dead) in my model is that I don't need to lug around an ever-more complex and detailed procedure for critical injuries; rather, I can just pin down the first idea that makes sense and assign that. Quicker, and most importantly, less quantified: we have to discover what each injury means, and we never know in advance what the particulars of each are. This leaves more room for medical maneuvering, and leaves the player delightfully alone in deciding whether the character is still viable in some way or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476096/#Comment_476096" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T20:10:58+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  8:10PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 8:13PM by JonatanK.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a very good take. My players haven't objected to how harsh the major wounds can get, but I have never said that they can choose death immediately. I like that: if you ask me to just throw a major injury at you off the top of my head, I can't guarantee that it will be both realistic and fair! So if you want the fair system, die now, otherwise you explicitly sign up for "whatever I think of first". Next time I run a game like this, I'll definitely use that from the get-go. I'm not sure if I want to backpedal and sell this on my current players now, though. We only have three sessions left, so I might just tough it out at squaring the circle of injury options that are simultaneously varied and interesting and roughly the same level of survivability as each other. Nor 100% sure.<br/><br/>Speaking of the end of the campaign: my players are dying to know all the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I told them today that I'll host a tell-all debriefing session after Friday's session. If anyone wants to be able to tackle this dungeon again, with me or another GM, then they shouldn't attend. I think they'll all be there, and I don't blame them\u2014while Stonehell is good, there are other dungeons for future campaigns. I spoiled myself on playing Stonehell by reading it years ago, even though it seemed more likely then that I'd get the chance to see it as a player than as a GM based on my gaming habits. I also told them about this thread, but that they shouldn't read it until after Friday.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Similar to how we've fleshed out magic and cleric rules (right, I haven't told you my system for how often Father could Bless), we're now hashing out weapon differentiations and some Fighter Initiations in our Discord channel. Here are some Initiations I wrote up:<br/><br/><br/><b>Weapons training</b>: you gain +1 to AC when using a weapon with longer reach than your opponent; you gain +1 to hit when using a lighter weapon than your opponent; you roll d8s for damage when using a two-handed weapon; you gain +1 initiative when attacking with ranged weapon unhindered.<br/><br/><b>Spear training</b>: when using a spear, you gain +1 to hit, and +2 to AC against opponents with shorter reach than you.<br/><br/><b>Longsword training</b>: when using a longsword, you gain +1 AC against opponents with shorter reach than you, and you have advantage on your damage rolls.<br/><br/><b>Bow training</b>: when using a bow, taking an extra action only costs you 5 initiative points, and you may do so in any round in which you act before all your opponents.<br/>[It usually costs 10, and is only available to the one with the highest initiative\u2014i.e. must also act before all his comrades.]<br/><br/><br/>But now we're considering adopting the "Weapons training" bonuses for everyone, all the time. Those of our players most knowledgeable about medieval weaponry have remarked on the fact that all weapons are mechanically identical. We've talked about fictional positioning, but no-one has so far been able to e.g. keep someone at bay with a spear such that the spear-wielder got to attack but the opponent did not, or anything like that. Most people have used sword\u2014based on the fact that all other weapons are mechanically identical.<br/>(Note that the +AC for longer reach and +attack for lighter weapon, if allowed everyone, effectively cancel each other out in the case of e.g. sword vs dagger.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476100/#Comment_476100" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T21:14:40+00:00" title="August 13, 2018  9:14PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great writeups, as usual. I'm really enjoying the various phantasmagoric imagery from the module - it's making me want to run some dungeon crawls myself. (I've played a few sessions recently, but haven't run anything since our adventures here on Story Games several years ago!)<br/><br/>How did you come up with those proclamations/riddles for the skull? Presumably, since the players have to come up with a question, and you roll what type of response, they can't be prepared in advance, but your answers seem fairly well thought out.<br/><br/>A rules question (for both of you, potentially):<br/><br/>Those spellcasting rules suggest a fairly high probability of "whiffing" (casting a spell to no effect, for instance). In my experience, that's really not much fun.* Is that a concern for either of you at all?<br/><br/><br/>*: Although, as a counterpoint, in the current adventure dungeon crawl houseruled D&amp;D I am a part of, spells operate on something more like a PbtA system, where the GM gets to improvise drawbacks or disasters on failed spellcasting rolls. I've had two wizard characters whose spellcasting attempts were significant enough failures that they basically superceded the actual adventure. (For instance, the first thing I tried - to animate a statue - led us to a random table for nearby spirits, and the statue turned into the reincarnation of some ancient minor god-being. We spent the rest of the session dealing with this monster, at the expense of not making any progress in the module itself. So perhaps at least a "spellcasting failures lead to disaster" approach might not always be welcome at every table! I have a method I like for my own house D&amp;D, which I feel avoids such issues, but it's still a work in progress.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476104/#Comment_476104" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T22:35:41+00:00" title="August 13, 2018 10:35PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2018 10:41PM by JonatanK.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the <b>stone head oracle</b>: "...but your answers seem fairly well thought out." Thanks for the complement! My process is I, uh, sat quiet for a minute after rolling while I thought of a good answer.<br/><br/>By the book, one third of the time you will literally get one of these randomly:<br/>1. \u2015Seek out the well that whistles and cast a treasure into its depths.<br/>2. \u2015Avoid pointed arguments. The results can be shocking.<br/>3. \u2015Seclusion is magic\u2018s watchword. Seek the room without doors.<br/>4. \u2015Death rests uneasy here. Do not awaken that which cannot sleep.<br/>5. \u2015Beware the caves for they be the home of the Dragon.<br/>6. \u2015Pester not the fish that breathes air!<br/><br/>For "where's the treasure?", 3, 4 and 5 sort of work with various amounts of squinting. 1 definitely looks like an answer, it's just false. 6 is true but obviously irrelevant, and 2 is... let's go with broadly applicable. I think with 2 or 6 the jig would have been up even more, as in they would have assumed that the oracle was not only untrustworthy, but also giving an answer causally unrelated to the question. Now that I think about it, I'll make sure to replace nr 5 with a new one now that I've used it.<br/><br/>To walk through my thoughts: when asking about the dragon's weakness, the "true" result they got was my best effort at saying something useful without being too prosaic about it. (I had high confidence they would catch my punny Swedish "look out/look up" thing, knowing them.) If I had gotten "false", I would just have fabricated a classic weakness: silver weapons, a missing scale, or staring into its eyes without blinking perhaps. If they had listened, man would they have hated that oracle, but I'd have to assume that's a foreseen outcome both by whoever's responsible in-universe, and by Micheal Curtis. had they rolled "cryptic response" again, then both 1, 2 and 3 might've fooled them, when presented as leads to a dragon weakness. 4 would be non-sequitur, 5 again would just show the seams, and 6... they might have taken that as a suggestion to weaponise the poison gas trap against the dragon? It's not too far off so they might have had a shot actually.<br/><br/>For their last question, "will we survive this", if they had gotten a "true" result I would have given them something like "Yes, if you do exactly this: walk out this door and to the right. Then turn left. Wait behind the corner for a minute, then double back, go left, right, then left." I knew about the gloomies planning to encircle them at this point, and this plan to sneak past them would be executed before it was time for another wandering monster check, so they'd had gotten out scot free and left some mildly confused gloomies. If I had felt mean, I might have given the answer slowly, but then asked for wits checks to have parts of it repeated. For a cryptic response, I think all of them could be construed as being tips on how to survive (but again, repeat answers would just fall apart). For "false", well, I gave them the best thing I could.<br/><br/>A "false" answer to "where's the treasure" would have been tricky; I would have regretted not foreseeing and committing to one ahead of time. You see, it was very easy to get into the "what do they deserve" mindset here, so I'm glad I didn't roll it. Give them something to easy to disprove (I dunno, "just outside my door") and they would write off the oracle as a phony\u2014on the first question, boring! To the extent that the oracle has a will, it doesn't want that either. Give them something more elaborate, and I might just get them to chase that rainbow for a session or two. Sure, other adventure will happen on the way, but I don't want a large part of this campaign to be a wild goose chase if I have anything to say in the matter\u2014and since I get to interpret what "false" means, I do. So I'd feel compelled to make up something with the right level of wrongness. My best candidates in hindsight are:<br/>- "In the trash heap". It was close by so it'd be easy to check, and there are spitting cobras there.<br/>- "In the crypts on the left-hand side". I had rolled the crypts randomly and all the treasure was on the other side\u2014but after fighting some undead and rats for nothing, they might consider the interpretation that the oracle was using the (unintuitive) opposite perspective? Worst case, they'd fight a bunch of undead, which is what they did this session anyway :P<br/>- "A secret chamber in the throne room". It'd be false because they had already looted it, so they might assume the oracle was just working on old information. Then there's still a point in asking more questions!<br/><br/>These took a few minutes to come up with; I'm not sure if I could have done it on the spot. Except for the trash heap. Digging through compost just to find a cobra never gets old.<br/><br/><br/>Tips for putting something like this in your dungeon: either have the GM embellish and modify the "cryptic responses" that are put down verbatim in the table, or expect the players to at least suspect that the answers are unrelated to the question posed. For me, I would also have appreciated a few words about the oracle's will. Does it want to be used, or left alone? Does it want to hurt people, play pranks, or neither? Is it a creation, or a trapped being?<br/><br/>Also: the dungeon notes says the statue has crystal eyes, but specifies neither their worth nor what happens if they are pried out.<br/><br/>Also also: the Wheel of Fortune can be spun twice a day, and the oracle will answer three questions each day. The players have no idea both of these effects are "per day" and I give it about 50/50 odds they will try either of them again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476105/#Comment_476105" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-13T22:41:15+00:00" title="August 13, 2018 10:41PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On my <b>spellcasting rules</b>: I wouldn't know, we never had anyone try anything but prepared casting yet. Remember, with a 100% rating in your spell, prepared casting is without checks (unless the spell effect is a check), and ritual casting is your full Knowledge and then Will against DC 20. With that said, I have been thinking about having something more interesting happen when failing the ritual casting checks. At the very least, I assume you could bump up the skill a few points as you learn from your mistakes, I guess? Otherwise, a mistake in Knowledge could mean there's something wrong with what you're trying to do\u2014perhaps a chance of accidentally reversing the spell or hitting the wrong target?\u2014and a failure of Will that it takes too much out of the caster\u2014HP damage or fatigue perhaps?<br/><br/>We'll see, if people start learning new spells and trying to cast them before they're mastered. So far the magic-users haven't even asked if they can learn each others' spells, which I sort of assumed they would ask...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

casting check by less than five points, then something "interesting" happens - an explosion of xd6 damage by default, if I think of nothing better. This is a little bit of a special case in that failing by <i>more</i> is safer, but that's because of how I conceptualize of ritual magic: for the ritual to actually fail in an "interesting" way the character needs to get it right enough for something to happen. If I just did the usual "greater degree of failure implies a bigger boom" thing, then that would mean that a less skilled ritualist is more effective at causing a spectacular failure, which makes no sense.<br/><br/>Basically: to get anything to actually happen by ritual magic, controlled or not, you need to roll at least a given result. We have occasionally split the entire process into a "power-gathering check" and a "control check" precisely so as to make it work more like the universal resolution system.<br/><br/>In general a task resolution system does not need to fail forward by default, though: it suffices that resources are spent. Just like trying to pick a lock does not need to cause the door to explode on a failure, trying to cast a spell does not need to cause a magical mishap. Spent time and spell-casting resources (magical reagents) is already a consequence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476121/#Comment_476121" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T18:19:37+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  6:19PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2018 6:19PM by JonatanK.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 7: Stonehell no more<br/><br/>The surviving adventurers (Bo\xfer\xfan, Nameless and Ren\xe9e) go back to their base camp to regroup, and then bury their dead. They consider leaving Doggo's corpse in the refrigerator room to see whether it would re-animate (it wouldn't've) but Bo\xfer\xfan is now being played to the hilt as a zealous Christian (very tongue-in-cheek, as everyone around the table assume it's a ploy to not get accused of witchcraft). I realise I completely forgot this in the last report: Bo\xfer\xfan used her <i>Enlarge</i> spell in the scuffle with the zombies in the fire beetle room, so Schvuu spent 10 minutes 20% larger, with a 20% increase in strength and damage (which we rolled as 1d6 damage plus 2d6/10 damage, i.e. a needlessly complex method of randomising whether there'd be a +1).<br/><br/>I make the players a deal in the interest of making play happen with the full group: rest for the day, new recruits will arrive in the morning, and in return I'll only roll three random encounter checks (rather than the 20 it would normally be, with 1 per hour). They took the deal, and the one encounter they have is the large black bear (the actual animal, not the barbarian tribesman) that they faced on their first expedition. They were fetching water from the hot pool (they tried it and didn't die) and it was coming for a drink, so they just left it alone.<br/><br/>The new characters are Lorem Ipson, the monk, and an angry bearded warrior. Both have incredibly sub-par stats: Friar Lorem is the worst so far, with 8, 5, 8, 5, 8. The players decide to put these two on the front lines, since they are hella expendable.<br/><br/>They re-investigate the inscriptions just above the staircase, to see if Bo\xfer\xfan or Ren\xe9e understand any of the runes. They find three complete messages:<br/>- "find the cave with the well; throw down gold and your wish will come true"<br/>- "the dead are restless in this place"<br/>- "the gloomy, white creatures are not to be trusted"<br/><br/>They go down into Stonehell again. This time they head for the dragon's caves. They enter a natural cave system with multiple paths, and hear the low voices of quiet gloomies to their right. They investigate, and find 7 gloomies gathering guano from a cave full of sleeping bats. They are wary of making noise, but it's unclear if this is to avoid disturbing the bats, fear of the dragon, or both. The gloomies tell them that the Black Bears (the barbarian tribe, not the animals) want them dead. These gloomies, however, are too chicken to do anything against 5 adventurers, so they ask the party to please not mention this encounter to any Black Bears they run across? The party move on, but watch their rear.<br/><br/>They go down another tunnel, which splits into two. From the left passage they hear a whistling, whining noise, like wind. Sure enough, the tunnel opens up into a small cavern with a deep shaft in the floor, with a faint wind flowing upwards. As they investigate, they also hear a voice down the next tunnel: "halt", spoken in Gaul, like a command given to a comrade. The party ready their weapons.<br/><br/>I roll morale for the four Black Bears they encounter, and determine that they will attack. They split up, and I set a timer for 4 rounds until they have gone around and will hit them in the rear. However, the party take a defensive position and the remaining Black Bears are not cautious enough. Both Bo\xfer\xfan and the bearded warrior ready attacks, and strike them down as soon as they show their heads in the tunnel. (20 XP; the remaining two are worth 20 more but I consider them part of another encounter if they catch up later on.)<br/><br/>They quickly loot the bodies for some silver pieces, and almost by luck they get out of there before the remaining two Black Bears arrive\u2014lucky since they are currently press-ganging the guano-collecting gloomies to join the fray as well. The party explore the tunnel the Black Bears came from (leaving one tunnel unexplored inside the cave system) and emerge at the crossroads by the previously locked door and the crypts. They duck in there and take a short rest.<br/><br/>I decide that the Black Bears haven't noticed that the door, which has always been locked before, is now unlocked, so they lose the party and start searching the nearby rooms during the rest. Had the party gone back toward the dragon now, they'd have a good chance of just slipping by their pursuers, and otherwise would have surprised them somewhat. However, Lorem Ipson's player convinces Nameless' (who is leading the party by virtue of seniority) that if he had designed this crypt, there would be treasure behind the third door to the right. I randomised the monsters and treasure a few sessions ago, but sure enough: that crypt is the only one with a treasure and no monsters! They break open the door and wait for a minute to ensure that all the dead stay down. Then they search the room, and find an ancient two-handed sword in surprisingly good condition and of good craftsmanship. Ren\xe9e, the magician, quickly deduces that it's magic. The bearded warrior grasps it, and feels more stable and powerful already! It gives the wielder +1 HP, re-applied every short rest (but not after a long rest, though).<br/><br/>They speculate about the other doors. The true distribution is that all four doors on the left have monsters but no treasure; the remaining two on the right have monsters and treasure. I didn't follow the decision process too closely, but Nameless ends up breaking open another of the right-hand side ones. Four zombies awaken. Bo\xfer\xfan gets an arrow in there before they line up two fighters to keep the zombies from getting out.<br/><br/>The bearded warrior has terrible luck with his new sword, and they struggle with the zombie for a few rounds. Halfway through, the zombie manages to get ahold of Nameless, and rips out a chunk of her neck! Major injury, halved Strength, Will and Charisma. A lot of blood: a death save each round, DC increasing by 1 each time, or she's dead dead.<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan rushes to her side, but rolls a natural 1 on her medicine check and forces an extra death save for Nameless. She makes it into the next round, when Bo\xfer\xfan has better luck and stabilises the bleeding somewhat. Death saves now come every 10 minutes, which might allow them to get out.<br/><br/>Ren\xe9e is <i>Enlarged</i> by Bo\xfer\xfan, slays a zombie and uses an extra success to seize the moment and shut the door. The warrior holds it while she casts her spell, which seals the door for one turn. The zombies scratch and tackle it, but the spell holds. (40 XP, for 2 zombies destroyed. Sealing away monsters would constitute overcoming them, except 1. they didn't get the treasure they were guarding which was the whole point of awakening them in the first place, and 2. they only postponed the problem.)<br/><br/>They open the door out into the corridor... and stare into the eyes of two Black Bears and a group of gloomies. I had rolled pretty easy Wits checks on behalf of their pursuers to have them hear the commotion of the fighting in the crypt. They have been waiting outside for at least a few rounds.<br/><br/>(part 7 part 2 in a separate comment)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476122/#Comment_476122" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T18:25:14+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  6:25PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ren\xe9e, who opened the door, trades a few blows with the Black Bears before retreating back in. However, the bearded warrior is in a berserker rage after taking a hit from the zombies, so he rushes out in her stead. He is quickly flanked and slain.<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan fires an arrow, and their attackers scatter to the sides, out of sight. Ren\xe9e starts negotiating with them, and the party are asked to hand over all their food and treasure. Bo\xfer\xfan throws out a sack with half of her rations, which the gloomies quickly run off with. Then Ren\xe9e throws out a small pouch of 93 copper coins, opened so that they will scatter all over the floor. Bo\xfer\xfan gets a clear shot at one of the Black Bears as he leans forward sweep some coins towards him, and he's dead! Bo\xfer\xfan drops her bow and rushes forward, grabbing the magic sword lying next to her fallen comrade, and drives it into the other Black Bear. The gloomies flee upon witnessing such battle prowess. (90 XP)<br/><br/>The remaining party pick themselves up, grab the backpacks of their fallen and start towards the exit. However, they don't get far before Nameless starts feeling dizzy, collapses against the wall, and stops breathing.<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan and Ren\xe9e are now only two people, lugging the packs of three fallen friends. They go through the room with the fish statue, passing two doors that were recently opened by fleeing gloomies. The portcullis is down, however, which indicates that the gloomies have hidden by the Wheel of Fortune. Ren\xe9e lifts the portcullis while Bo\xfer\xfan guards the rear. They trigger the magic voice\u2014"Fools! Flee before your bones rest here forever!"\u2014and make it to the stairs. Two gloomies are there, waiting for them, but too scared to take any action. The adventurers glare at them and go up the stairs.<br/><br/>They split up the gear, leaving what they cannot carry in their base camp, and then begin the journey back toward Maastricht. They split 280sp (from coins and selling fire beetle glands to the alchemist) between the two of them, netting them 140 XP. The bearded warrior's player (also played Father before) remarks that the 1500 required for Level 2 seems "somewhere between a bad joke and an insult".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476123/#Comment_476123" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T18:51:30+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  6:51PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over lunch, we discussed the nature of the game. People were starting to feel that the endless meat grinder was bringing down their spirits. Everyone assured me that this wasn't a "not what I signed up for" situation, because I had given very fair warning when pitching the game. However, this style of game is not what any of these players normally play\u2014and not what I normally run. With the last of the original party dead (Nameless, who also had by far the best stat line), the play style was starting to sink in. Choice quote from one player: "It's exactly what you said it would be. It's low-level DnD. And I'm starting to remember why I hate it."<br/><br/>I tried to set the discussion at the level I found interesting for our decision-making, and walked through my philosophy: the point of the game is to see: given these resources, can we meet this challenge? Sometimes it will be affected somewhat by system artifacts, but to a large degree our manipulation of game pieces should be similar to a "what would actually happen" scenario. This is the game I'm interested in running, so if the players are actually after a heroic tale, regardless of actual challenge, I'd point them to another campaign. But if they start to feel that this particular challenge (Stonehell), with this particular rule-set and starting hand (1st-level characters), was no longer interesting\u2014by all means, we should switch. I offered them to roll up 2nd-level characters\u2014double the HP\u2014or switching to another dungeon.<br/><br/>We discussed the nature of Stonehell. They had pretty much concluded that since the dungeon was controlled by an organised force of intelligent humans (the Black Bears, with their gloomie lackeys), they basically stood no chance of achieving anything down there. They figure that the Black Bears are only going to start guarding the staircase better and better, so that any foray will run into scouts/guards within a few turns, and a full-blown war-party being called in within a few more.<br/><br/>(I personally think they're overstating things a bit. They have not tried bribing, tricking or threatening the gloomies as a whole, or at least the mid-sized parties they encounter, into letting them pass in silence. They have only had two run-ins with the Black Bears, both of which have lead to their sound defeat and return to Maastricht\u2014by the level of strategy I run the Black Bears with, they will see the next two weeks silence as proof the adventurers were scared off, and security won't be much changed next time (at least as long as the Black Bears still have the Gundar to worry about). In other words, the Black Bears' anger abates over the time it takes to make a resupply journey. But they have never considered making a resupply journey with less than half the party being dead or unable to fight. And they have a dreadfully short attention span when down in the dungeon. They literally started breaking open zombie crypts, after stating multiple times that the dragon was their goal, just because they happened to duck into the crypts room. The largest part of their failure today, in my opinion, was to not post a guard outside the crypt room, or at least be aware that the Black Bears might here them fighting zombies through the door.<br/><br/>But, I'm not in a position to judge how possible or impossible Stonehell feels, since I've only experienced it from the GM's perspective, with all information available. They overestimate the Black Bears slightly, but that's based on the image the Black Bears project.)<br/><br/>The same player again: "At this level of play, fighting is very often 'die or flee'. And I'm not that good at coming up with plans other than fighting." Very honest, and it's not like the others were that much better at coming up with them either.<br/><br/>The conclusion was: yes, with this level of characters, tackling Stonehell is not a challenge we're interested in trying again. Under these rules, Stonehell defeated them. Fair's fair, let's play another game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476124/#Comment_476124" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T19:13:44+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  7:13PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Splitting up my posts since I'm apparently incredibly verbose)<br/><br/>However, it was also clear that one of the things that was the most disheartening wasn't the character death per se\u2014it was the promise of character progression, tantalising in how it was often referred to but next-to-impossible to reach. 1500 XP is a lot when a typical run gives 280sp split two ways... at the cost of 3/5 players dying. I could only agree: with the clarity brought by trying out the rules in play, an 8-session campaign such would be fairer to advertise without a mention of levels. No-one will ever get to level 2 anyway, so if the game is not interesting enough for 1st-level characters just racking up XP like a high score, then we should do something about that.<br/><br/>Firstly, I remember this exact line of reasoning from some discussion about one of Eero's campaigns. If I ran a longer campaign, my answer might be: okay. I strive to make this game fair and interesting for 1st-level characters, so yes, it is my hope that you'll want to play even if you never expect to make it to level 2.<br/><br/>In this game, though, I felt with the players. I want to see 2nd-level characters in play, because it's cool. I want the reward cycle to be calibrated so that players who succeed get a reward they are happy with, rather than luring them into longing for a theoretical $1,000,000 prize leaving them unhappy with their well-earned day job salary. And in this campaign, a limited-time offer to try out this play style and these rules, I'd rather change things around so that we get to try out all the rules.<br/><br/>(I apologise if I'm sounding defensive here. It stems from me making the call, originally, to set the levelling requirements as I did, and now finding out that it was wrong for this campaign. I need to justify the decision to change things, or else accept that the original decision was unjustified.)<br/><br/>So we slashed the XP requirements by 90%. Bo\xfer\xfan and Ren\xe9e, who earned XP under the old scheme, had their XP totals slashed as well, landing them at 28 XP. At 150, they will advance to level 2. We have two sessions left, and we might get to see the triumph. Everyone knows that this will be worth peanuts compared to what it would have meant if anyone had made it under the old rules\u2014but this new game is the one we want to play.<br/><br/>Under the old rules, perhaps they could have gotten there if they had just "git gud". About this particular group of players, we'll probably never know. But I bought a game on Steam a few weeks ago, played for an hour, and then decided it was too hard and I wanted to play something else. And that's most likely all the time I'll ever afford the game DoorKickers in my life. No shame, no regrets. Now, they can continue at about their current levels of caution, patience, lateral thinking, and willingness to just duke it out with the dice, and maybe it'll be enough to reach the rush of level 2. As long as I get to play the world to the hilt at whatever difficulty level we choose, I'm game to GM.<br/><br/><br/>Back in the first session, I had pitched them an "abandoned fort, with underground treasure vaults" and "a wizard's tower". The players of dead characters rolled up new ones, and an all-mage party left for the wizard's tower.<br/><br/>(I'll stay in this thread for the rest of the campaign, even though the title is misleading now.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476125/#Comment_476125" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T20:01:55+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  8:01PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great actual play and has motivated me to dig out Stonehell and get some players!  I was thinking about the demotivated players and I wonder if one factor is that people get killed and then sit around waiting for the rest of the party to make it out so they can introduce their new guys.  <br/><br/>In the OG days of the 70's, I think we handled this with henchmen who would get "field promotions" to PC as needed, or by having replacements show up mid-dungeon, either as hostiles who get recruited to the heroes' side, or by having "good guys" turn up as prisoners in the next plausible room you enter. <br/><br/>I wonder if you're running into some trouble because you're trying to blend a real world setting with a megadungeon, which is pretty much 100% D&amp;D tropes. But seriously, henchmen would solve so many problems for these guys.

It's been a relatively stable fact that new parties have taken roughly 20 sessions to get a character to 2nd level. Whole parties progress to higher levels only after dozens and dozens of sessions. The initial half dozen sessions look just like this: a few tens or hundreds of points here and there while the party figures out their positioning and strategy.<br/><br/>I find it very interesting that you have seem to have a similar pace here, despite my preconception that our advancement pace is noticeably slower than your average, typical D&amp;D crew. Even hardcore old school pundits don't seem to advertise an "eternal 1st level" situation like the one we essentially have enjoyed in my play. However, here you are with something similar. It might be something in the mechanical rules that does it, or otherwise it's a matter of the GMing principles. Interesting either way.<br/><br/>I have never had the fighting morale of the group fail in a wholesale way like this, but my go-to contingency plan for those circumstances is to give the players more varied and powerful starting positions without changing up the scoring math. For instance, one offer I float regularly when players complain about the game's difficulty is that I'm cool with it if anybody wants to start up a 3rd level character with zero experience points - that is, they'll spend the time other characters would spend on 1st-2nd levels as 3rd levelers, and then progress normally afterwards. I think that the main reason that players haven't taken me up on this offer is that they would perceive it as an unfair advantage compared to the rest of the group, who stoically accept their lot and toil away waiting for that big break.<br/><br/>(I think that closest we've gotten to a player accepting a "break" is that when a player complained about character power and I suggested that they could play a knight if they wanted to, they took it - much better equipment, training and fiscal situation than usual, but what do I care, you can play whatever fictional concept you want as far as I'm concerned. I think the player was playing their first character then, and interestingly didn't want similar advantages later - I think they got on board with the grim challenge play thing.)<br/><br/>That being said, my willingness to provide players will easy mode conditions within my own terms doesn't mean that I don't appreciate hardcore play; you couldn't get me to play with fixed stats or unearned levels with wild horses as a player. I have similar brain damage when it comes to computer games; you pretty much need to convince me that a game has been designed to be played at some specific difficulty level before I'll go for anything but the hardest, which sort of makes some games less than enjoyable as an experience [grin].<br/><br/>Also, something from my yet-to-be-authored walkthrough to hardcore D&amp;D: I am personally strongly in favour of not switching up dungeons without an overriding reason with a starter party. I understand the idea that you might have been handed a lemon of a dungeon, but it is extremely more likely, particularly if the GM gave you free choice of dungeons at the start, that you've got something that still includes remarkable amounts of treasure. The more you explore without hitting that treasure, the likelier it is that you'll find it the next time, as long as the dungeon is not strategically constrained in some way. The optimal play, I think, is that as long as progress is being made, the party should continue chipping away at that single dungeon to get that treasure. Starting again with a second dungeon means losing all the mapping investment (and possible investment in weakening the monsters there). This logic changes after the first successful heist, but for that first one it shouldn't matter how "clean" your operation is: just get that treasure however you need to. The treasure will change the gearing up possibilities for the second dungeon, and it might, with luck, be enough to get somebody to 2nd level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476128/#Comment_476128" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T20:25:07+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  8:25PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2018 4:32PM by JonatanK.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 8: The first expedition of the Maastricht Mages' Guild of the Rose<br/><br/>Ren\xe9e's player had to leave after lunch, so for our final 90 minutes of adventure logistics there are only four of them. Bo\xfer\xfan happens to run across a party of three magicians, who have recently formed a (presumably very secret) guild. Their name (and of course their symbol) is taken from their leader, Roos (played by Nameless' player). The other two members are Maarten (same player as the bearded warrior, Father and Dan a.k.a. Unintelligible) and Gotbert Royston (same player as Lorem Ipson, Schvuu and G. F. Tr\xe1in). They are headed for the wizards' tower, with their sights primarily set for magical secrets!<br/><br/>(As per the discussion earlier in the thread, this is not an XP-giving quest. Luckily for them, there is loot to be had there as well.)<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan spends her share of the Stonehell loot on a set of chainmail armour, boosting her AC 4 steps to a whopping 26 (at the cost of two stone's worth of encumbrance).<br/><br/>The spell loadout:<br/>- Bo\xfer\xfan: Enlarge, which we've already seen in action<br/>- Roos: Mending, which repairs objects (a tad lackluster in the players' eyes)<br/>- Maarten: Spider Climb (as per LotFP)<br/>- Gotbert Royston: Summon (as per LotFP, with the unplayable crazy left out and the Domination roll re-jiggered to use this game's Will stat)<br/><br/>(When they set out there were only the four of them. They didn't get very far before the session ended, so we decided over Discord that retroactively, they were actually six: both Ren\xe9e and the new character that tomorrow's guest player will roll up.)<br/><br/><br/>The wizard's tower is the lovely little adventure location of the <a href="http://blog.trilemma.com/2016/04/the-sky-blind-spire.html" rel="nofollow">Sky-Blind Spire</a>, by Michael Prescott of Trilemma Design. Cliff's notes:<br/>- It's a magical maze, so the internal geography is completely disconnected from reality\u2014and the placement of the windows sometimes makes it desirable to climb out one window and in through another<br/>- Walking through the rooms in a convoluted (but hopefully deducible) order completes a ritual that grants a wish<br/>- There are Gauls (originally goblins) who have cast a ritual on the tower grounds, rendering anyone who enter unable to see the colour blue; they of course carry blue cloaks and tarps<br/>- There is a large silver treasure here, guarded by a team of monstrous cannibals (originally giants) who can't find their way out after their exit was covered by a blue tarp<br/><br/>It's the opposite of Stonehell in many ways. Prep-wise, it's completely system-agnostic, which means some more work for me\u2014here it's case by case, whereas for Stonehell I had something of a Labyrinth Lord stat conversion strategy. In size, of course, there's less material here than a single floor of Stonehell. At the same time it's more densely packed, with very few disconnected elements. If the players want to solve this place like a puzzle, they could probably hold almost all of it in their heads at once.<br/><br/>As for challenge it's hard to say; some of the monsters could get pretty touch. But treasure-wise it's a complete cornucopia compared to Stonehell. The giants in the original have "6 sacks of silver". A 2-stone sack in my game holds 1500 coins (my encumbrance rules are made to fit Sandra's awesome <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/inventory.pdf" rel="nofollow">inventory sheet</a>, which is based on DnD5 rules I think), so that's 9000sp if they get it all out. Enough to get 6 characters to level 2 under the old rules :P Under both rulesets, I'll use a "not more than one whole level per expedition" rule, so if they bring it all home they'd all just get 150 XP, i.e. Bo\xfer\xfan would go to 188 XP.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The journey towards the tower starts up the river Maas, and they actually disembark at the same spot as if headed for Stonehell. This time, however, they land on the northern riverbank, and keep following the river upstream, westward into Gaul. They come to a side stream, joining the main river from a plateau to the north, and follow that up the hillside. Over the crest, they see a large lake, and the tower as well. At first it seems to be standing out in the water, but as they draw closer they see a narrow peninsula reaching from the eastern lakeshore, almost a fourth of the lake's breadth.<br/><br/>The tower itself has five storeys above ground level, each with windows facing each cardinal direction. There's also a side wing of sorts, with no doors or windows, giving the ground floor double the floor space of the higher floors. As they approach, I ask them all to roll Knowledge and they immediately realise that the tower houses great magic: a powerful artifact, a recently-completed ritual, a great living and working mage, or something of that caliber. (However, none of them roll high enough to notice they just stepped into the ritual circle of the Sky-Blindness curse cast by the Ricalu tribesmen. It will set in after about an hour.) They also notice that the windows are completely open, no shutters or anything. Even weirder, there's a chain hanging from each window except the lowest one, reaching down to the window below it.<br/><br/>They walk around the tower to check the backside, and find a bright blue lean-to pitched against the wall. (They were lucky to come here within the first hour, since after that it's going to be invisible to them.) They hail whoever's inside, and a slightly surprised Gaul pokes their head out. They speak broken Germanic, and explain that they came here for silver, didn't find much and will soon be leaving. The party leads with "we're looking for magic secrets!" so there's no overt conflict of interests. They mention that they just got here, so the Ricalu tribesman hatches a plan: if he stalls until the curse hits them in an hour, they can just disappear under their cloaks. He introduces himself as Dano, and offers to show them the lower level of the tower along with his friend Contedd.<br/><br/>They open the large double doors\u2014iron-banded wood, old but still sturdy\u2014and enter the "unwelcoming hall" of Titardinal the Kastromancer (not that they know his name). Several metal cages hang in chains from the ceiling, each containing one or more human skeletons. There's doorway to the left, and a smashed-down door ahead of them. Dano heads to the left.<br/><br/><br/>This is were we called time, so part 8 actually fit into one post! They will explore the mind-bending tower in part 9, tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476129/#Comment_476129" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T20:57:54+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  8:57PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DannyK: we talked about hiring help. I'm squarely on Eero's side here, in that part of me wants to scream at them "you're so close! Now you can afford a few hirelings! Don't give up!". But I can't make that decision for them, and the truth is that before this last expedition they really didn't afford help. Since I'm using the LotFP rules until I see a need to put in the effort to re-work them, their ~250sp buys them... two infantry mercenaries and a guard for their basecamp, one month's wages paid? I mean, it'd probably be worth it. The problem with these rules is they're very clear about the distinction between salaried hirelings, who then feel weird to suddenly promote to PC status (to a weird economic gain for the party, since they no longer "require pay" in the same way?), and henchmen who have character classes and get half shares\u2014but who in turn cannot be hired above the PCs level -2. So, not in play until level 3, essentially. If I use these rules for another campaign down the road, I might or might not write my own price list for hirelings, but at the very least I'm removing that restriction.<br/><br/>Another factor is, I think, a bias against NPC hirelings for aesthetic reasons from at least one player. "This is an RPG; not a miniatures game." Not as a veto or anything, this is Father's player who had Doggo for several session, but as a preference. I definitely get the feeling that they want to win <i>as a small adventurer party</i>, and I think it's more of a preference than a lack of out-of-the-box thinking in this case.<br/><br/>However, I have made it pretty clear that it's the group's responsibility to quickly get back to a state where everyone has someone to play. The players at least tell me that waiting for the survivors to escape the dungeon hasn't been that bad, and we allow new recruits to wander into the ravine the next day. You're probably right that it contributes somewhat, though.<br/><br/>On another note, super happy to hear that my campaign has inspired you to pick up Stonehell yourself! Help yourself to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCiGYSngHv8jy64eg45GRrZ683xbScn-WrG_2S9bt7Q/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">my notes</a> if you want them\u2014there might be something in there that's not in the thread.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Eero: it wasn't really like the morale plummeted for the whole crew. I don't even think anyone would have even walked away if I'd just said "no, we press on, git gud". Maybe one of them. But yeah, it was pretty gloomy.<br/><br/>I agree with you about how to tackle your first dungeon. Man, if running this campaign has done anything for me, it's a deep longing to throw myself at a megadungeon, and show them how it's done! (Most likely grinding away a few characters while learning the same lessons over again.) Alas, I don't think anyone will run a game like this for me anytime soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476130/#Comment_476130" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-14T21:29:58+00:00" title="August 14, 2018  9:29PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" rel="nofollow">JonatanK</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Lorem Ipson, the monk</p></div></blockquote>\nThat's hilarious!<br/><br/><i>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

So still an all-mage party!<br/><br/><br/>I finished the last report saying Dano, the Gaul they met in a blue tent, was headed for the left corridor from the entrance hall. At the start of this session, we scratched that, and I say he stands there, acting the typical NPC guide who doesn't decide for the PCs where they're headed.<br/><br/>They investigate the room a little. They find a large roman numeral "I" carved into one of the floor tiles. They also notice that each of them has a small spark floating in the air around them, like a glowing dust speck. They surmise that by coming here, they have unwittingly set into motion a ritual, and as they progress with the steps the sparks will grow larger and brighter. They head forward to the next room, and as they enter their sparks do increase ever so slightly in size. A quick search yields the numeral "II" on the floor. Gotbert Royston, demon-summoner, map-maker and expert game design sage, immediately proclaims that they must find all numbered rooms and walk through them in order. Bo\xfer\xfan concurs, except she expects the completion of the ritual to be a bad thing, so she makes sure to go last.<br/><br/>They find a corridor with several offshoot tunnels\u2014much narrower than the 10' highways of Stonehell\u2014and see that the closest room is numbered "V". They backtrack, and check the hallway to the left. It seems to end in another room, but the doorway is covered by a large canvas. Dano confesses to having hung it up. "To make sure we don't wander in there," he says. "Someone lives there. Giant, scary creatures. Sometimes you can hear their deep songs echo through the tower." The party learns that Dano and Contedd have only ever seen these alleged giants' shadows, and assume the Gauls are just easily spooked. They cross past the canvas, leaving the Gauls behind.<br/><br/>They find themselves in a room with two exits, and through one of the narrow corridors they can see what looks like daylight\u2014very odd, since they didn't see any windows on the ground floor. On this side, the canvas hung over the exit is painted in the same clear blue colour as the Gauls' tent\u2014the tribes' own colour, perhaps? Furthermore, they notice that one of them leads to the east\u2014according to the map, they should reached the outside walls by now. The tower is larger on the inside than on the outside!<br/><br/>Their small sparks had shrunk in size again as soon as they went back to room I. Passing the canvas makes them disappear completely, and they find that the new room is number XVIII. They search on. They find room XX, which has a large window. As they look out, they find themselves looking down from the fourth-floor window.<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan the rear guard picks up voices coming from another room. Just a conversation, unclear what language. They carefully move closer, and then call out a greeting. A booming voice answers them: "Who are you?"<br/><br/>"We are mages of the Rose Guild!"<br/><br/>The troll (for that is who they are talking to) shows itself, now angry. "So it's your fault?"<br/><br/>"What is?"<br/><br/>"You've trapped us here with your spell! It's impossible to get out!"<br/><br/>The "troll" is an almost inhumanly large man, with grotesque features including warts and boils in his face. Bo\xfer\xfan rolls knowledge, and I say that of course she's heard stories about the "trolls" of these parts. They're mostly human, but they have a particular taste for human flesh. Some speculate that eating humans is what made them trolls in the first place.<br/><br/>Roos, the mages' leader, tell them that getting out is easy. The troll goes back to where he came from to consult with his friends, and then comes back accompanied by a female troll. They wave their weapons around and demand to be shown the way out. Roos leads the way. "The exit is just behind here, follow me." As she goes behind the canvas, the trolls freak out. "Where did she go? Sorcery! Trickery!" Roos comes back, and they act as if she popped out of thin air. They try to explain that it's just a canvas, but the trolls seem to think that there's no exit there at all. Ren\xe9e decides to cut to the chase and unties the cord by which the canvas is hung from a wall-mounted chandelier. It falls to the floor, and the trolls praise their makers: there's the exit!<br/><br/>They go back to get their things, and ask the party to just get out of their way. They get them to reveal that they have been living in this tower for quite a while now, but a few days ago the exit disappeared and they were trapped. The party does get out of their way, watching from room II how the trolls step outside in the sun. There are four of them in total, one of which wears plate armour, and most importantly: they carry with them six large sacks that jingle like coin! That's a humongous amount of loot, even if it's only copper. And the Gauls said they came to the tower looking for the rumoured silver treasure. However, the party judge four trolls to be beyond their capabilities, or at least too risky. Besides, the true treasure of the tower has to be whatever magical secrets it holds! They go to investigate the trolls' former quarters.<br/><br/>They find rooms XVII and XVI, a window that ought to face north but looks out as if from the fifth floor on the south side, and a few loose ends the trolls left: some bones (some human, some animal), a few scattered coins. There's a fire pit with a kettle hung on a chain that they seemingly left in their hurry. They also find what looks like a garbage chute going down into what would be the basement in a non-magical room layout (but now who can tell?).<br/><br/>As Gotbert looks out the 5th-floor window, he notices the weather has rapidly gone worse\u2014the previously clear blue sky is now grey all over. Suspecting magical trickery, Bo\xfer\xfan goes back to the 4th-floor window to check what the weather looks like from there. It's the same: grey skies. But now the remaining party, still searching the trolls' quarters, spot someone moving in a room further ahead. They sneak closer, and\u2014it's Bo\xfer\xfan! They have found the first true "loop" in the room layout. There are four rooms connected with corridors such that going east through all of them gets you back where you started. "Fucking magicians", Maarten's player exclaims.<br/><br/>Since all the room numbers here are so high, they decide to go back to room II and search for room III and up around there. They do find both III, IV and VI (and XXXIII), along with some more nonsensically placed windows. They also hear the screech of some seabird coming from whatever lieas above a staircase they found. More importantly, Bo\xfer\xfan hears footsteps behind them. They investigate and find nothing.<br/><br/>A little while later, they try to get someone's spark to grow in size from passing rooms I\u2013VI in order. After mistakenly going in the wrong order, Roos dashes back to room I to "reset" it. She suddenly hears footsteps beside her, sees nothing, and then out of nowhere gets stabbed in the back! She lets out a scream and then falls, knocks her head against the stone wall, and passes out. Someone else saw everything from just past room II, and they saw something flicker in the air when the attack happened, but then nothing.<br/><br/>Everyone readies their weapons and heads for the entrance hall. Maarten thinks he sees something moving close to the floor\u2014perhaps a small animal? or more accurately, a small <i>something</i> flickering in and out of existence... He lets loose an arrow, but doesn't hit anything. Then nothing happens. I tell them combat's over, but they're free to roll initiative again as soon as they seem to have anything to fight.<br/><br/><br/>(part 9 part 2 in a separate post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476160/#Comment_476160" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-16T09:53:57+00:00" title="August 16, 2018  9:53AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, these poor players are not sufficiently money-hungry yet if they're unwilling to ambush and rob four trolls for a major payday.

It was a minor injury, so she'll be hurting for a while but with a quick bandage she's fine to walk again. Then they hurry outside, back around the tower to the Gauls' tent. (Except for Bo\xfer\xfan, who goes to the edge of the water and starts collecting mod.) The tent is gone, without a trace! As they search along the tower wall, Maarten stumbles upon it: an invisible tent. He opens a flap. The inside of the tent is visible, both in the sense that he can see what's inside through the opening, and that he can see the inside of the tent canvas. It looks just like regular, but flip it over, and it disappears.<br/><br/>The party puts two and two together: they had assumed it was the trolls who were blind to the colour blue ("chroma keyed", as the term became around the table), but whatever curse or affliction it was seems to have spread to them too.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's no-one in the tent, and whoever was there seem to have left in a hurry. In fact, while Maarten searched for the tent, one of the others spotted something moving in the grass, away from them. They start following.<br/><br/>One of them (Maarten?) gets a lucky shot, and hits Dano through his invisibility cloak. Then Bo\xfer\xfan runs up with a bag full of mud, and throws it all over the other three. With floating mud specks to aim at, and a party of five all equipped with ranged weapons, the escaping Gauls go down quickly (40XP). Gotbert Royston even hits his last attack with two extra degrees of success, and uses them to bring his victim (injured Dano) down without killing him. He's at 0 HP, lying on the ground, disarmed and de-cloaked.<br/><br/>He's terrified and spills all the beans. Their party came here a few days ago aiming to steal the silver treasure from the trolls who lived here. Their shaman put a curse upon the place, so anyone who enters soon becomes blue-blind; the curse lasting for a couple days after you leave. But the party ruined everything by helping the trolls escape within that first hour of not being under the curse themselves!<br/><br/>They have the classic discussion on whether to let the poor bastard live or kill him. Gotbert gets a bonus to his Summon spell by using living sacrifices, but he doesn't want to drag around an injured Gaul for this purpose. Finally, they ask Dano who it was that stabbed Roos, their leader. He tries blaming Contedd (who is already dead), but finally admits to doing the deed himself. Roos takes his life in revenge.<br/><br/><br/>They clean the mud off the invisible cloaks. They are still a bit wary of attacking the trolls, but figure that they have their chance now that they are still under the curse! They spy the trolls from the tower entrance stairs: they're making their way across the plains to the east, but don't seem to be moving very fast. The party drops of some of their unneeded gear in the invisible tent to move faster, takes a short rest to re-roll HP, and then start the pursuit.<br/><br/>Since the trolls are encumbered and the party managed to get down to unencumbered, they gain on them quickly and catch up within a few hours. The last hour or so, they have been walking under their new invisibility cloaks (they made two more by cutting the large canvas that was hiding the trolls' exit into two). It's a bit tricky, seeing as they can't see out of the cloak without leaving their own face visible, but the trolls don't catch on. They spread out in a half-circle, and start firing away.<br/><br/>The trolls are in a disarray, and one of them goes down pretty quickly. Everyone shooting has to roll a wits save or drop the cloak, so as soon as the trolls start looking for where the arrows are coming from, they would have found someone to charge against pretty quickly. However, before they get that chance, Gotbert Royston starts casting his Summoning spell.<br/><br/><br/>For those of you who haven't read Lamentations of the Flame Princess, the Summon spell is by far the black sheep among the spells, even more so counting only the first-level spells, in terms of complexity. A five-step process determines everything from how powerful a creature is summoned, what its properties are (caster gets no influence at all), and whether the magician manages to control it.<br/><br/>Gotbert starts by blowing his Will save, meaning a more powerful creature than intended will be summoned. He had already chosen to try a Rank 2 creature (2 HD).<br/><br/>With his back towards the trolls and covered in blue cloth, he calls forth a terrible demon that takes the shape of an giant beetle, with flesh-rending mandibles. It has an AC of 28\u2014same as the half-plated troll\u2014regenerates 1d3 HP per turn, and is immune to normal weapons. It is telekinetic, able to lift a child with only its mind. Finally, this otherworldly creature cannot be comprehended by mortal eyes; it appears to us as a two-dimensional thing, more imparted over the visible world than part of it, and from some angles it disappears completely.<br/><br/>With all these powers, the creature rolls 1d20+18 in the Domination contest, while Gotbert rolls 1d20+Will which is 15. But luck prevails, and he wins the contest! The demon will be on our plane of existence for 11 turns, and under his control for that duration. He orders it to attack the armoured troll.<br/><br/>The cracking noise and a cloud of smoke finally give the trolls somewhere to direct their attention, and their armoured leader rushes toward it. However, the demon itself turns itself sideways, meaning the troll can't see anything clearly. Determined to attack whatever sorcery this is, he catches sight of the moving grass where Gotbert is rushing out of the way, and manages to hit him with his greatclub! Gotbert makes his injury saves\u2014his arm is displaced and bruised but it'll be better in a few days\u2014but his concentration is broken. The demon wins the new Domination roll, and breaks free. Luckily, its instinct is to kill all living things nearby, and the troll is still the closest. It starts biting at his legs, and Gotbert can slip away.<br/><br/>The remaining party shoot down the other two trolls from under their blue cloaks with ease\u2014they never manage to fight back in the confusion. Gotbert shouts a warning: the demon is loose, it will attack anyone! They all decide to hang back, and stop shooting at the lone armoured troll. Their best-case scenario is that the demon wins, but not too early, since it will turn on them afterwards. The troll has no chance of winning: it is immune to normal weapons, and besides it regenerates. We skip ahead through the combat turns with just the monster attacking (and the others "re-orienting", re-rolling their initiative in the hopes of improving). With 5 more turns in this world, the troll is slain.<br/><br/>The demon turns towards the closest mage. "But can it see us?" asks one player. "With the cloaks?" But the demon has never been to the tower. It's under no such curse. Everyone's wearing bright blue cloaks!<br/><br/>Now, this isn't dramatic a twist as it might seem. The party had figured this out before the troll died, and had backed away a considerable distance. Bo\xfer\xfan even took off her cloak and hid in the tall grass. Now that the monster turns on them, they just scatter in all directions and run like hell, and stay out of its grips until it departs this world. All's well that ends well!<br/><br/>They loot the trolls. The leader's half-plate armour was damaged, but Roos gets it back in shape with her <i>Mending</i> spell. More importantly, they open the six sacks to find them all full of silver! About half of it's coins, and the rest it cutlery, plates, goblets and candelabras. All told, the hoard is worth 9000sp.<br/><br/>(So much for the 1500 XP limit being "somewhere between a bad joke and an insult"!)<br/><br/>(part 9 part 3 in a separate post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476163/#Comment_476163" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-16T10:34:02+00:00" title="August 16, 2018 10:34AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha ha, a happy ending after all!<br/><br/>And yes, I thought that your original 1500 xp limit was entirely reasonable, surprise surprise. The players probably thought otherwise because they don't have a sense of how the game's xp distribution goes: long periods of gaining almost nothing followed by big bumps when you actually find treasure. An even "treasure per minute" grind rate is more of a video game thing, after all; it doesn't occur in "reality" because most of the time you're doing other things than looting treasure.<br/><br/>What actually <b>is</b> an insult are the monster XP and other similar intentionally petty points. That is very intentional, at least for me; I would be perfectly capable of not giving any points at all for encountering monsters if I wanted to. There are certain minor reasons to keep those points in the game, though, so they stay despite not having any real function regarding level-ups. Plus I like seeing players be insulted by those minor awards [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476164/#Comment_476164" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-16T10:52:06+00:00" title="August 16, 2018 10:52AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the sacks also contains a silver circlet, which the party of mages quickly agree has some unknown magic properties. Gotbert tries it on, and\u2014the sky becomes blue again. In fact, he can see the blue cloaks for what they are as well. The whole world seems to him to stand out clearer. <br/><br/>(I had been thinking a lot about how to represent the sky going "invisible". If I had just said that they couldn't see the sky, that it was "missing" or something, I thought it would be too obvious (not least to the trolls, who would have noticed that immediately since they had been "trapped" in a room with a window). I ended up going with "the weather looks much worse now than before\u2014the sky is just gray all over". Most of the weird things about this adventure so far they have figured out very early on, but they didn't catch the thing with the sky until this nice little "reveal".)<br/><br/>They get 80 XP for the trolls, and they think about what to do with the tower. They decide to go back for their remaining gear (of course), then bring their loot to Maastricht to stash it somewhere safe (and score XP for it), and only then come back to search the rest of the tower and complete the ritual. They collect what food the Gauls had on hand, and start following the stream towards the river.<br/><br/><br/>Two days' travel passes without incident, and on the second morning the curse is lifted for all of them. As they have breakfast on the river-bank, a lone traveller in a canoe approaches from the east. He asks if they can share their food, but they deny him, since they are worried about their rations lasting all the way to Maastricht. (When we have fast-forwarded the trip from Stonehell, which is essentially the same distance but along the other side of the river, the journey has taken 8 days, but they're much more encumbered this time with all the silver.) He responds that Maastricht sucks, they shouldn't go there. Turns out he has reason to be bitter: he was thrown out of the city after the Duke claims he looked at the Duke's daughter one time too many. Completely made-up, you understand!<br/><br/>They discuss a little whether he's worth using Charm person on, more to see how that spell works than anything else. I think they decided against it in the end, as his single canoe wouldn't help them haul silver anyway, but I don't exactly remember as this is where we ended the session.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sky-Blind Spire has <i>a lot</i> of treasure, especially in an XP-for-silver game! (In a typical XP-for-gold, the 9000sp would only be 900gp I believe.) It's written to be system-agnostic, so "six sacks of silver" is essentially up the the GM to interpret according to whatever criteria they want. I was considering making it less, both on the basis of the tower's particulars (Where does the silver come from? If it's looted from the tower, then what rooms was it originally stored in?) and from game balance. But I couldn't really weigh everything together in satisfying way, so I went with the default decision of just using the pre-written prep literally. Six sacks of silver, and our encumbrance rules specify what a typical sack is, so that's what it is.<br/><br/>If you remember, we slashed the XP requirements starting this session, so if they get all the silver to Maastricht they will end up with 1500sp shares. That's enough to go to 5th level, if it weren't for my cap of one level per expedition. So they'll have 1500sp to spend but only earn 150 XP. They have floated the idea of putting together one hell of a retainer party and go back to show Stonehell who's boss <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Seeing as Friday is our last session, and they have to first get back to Maastricht, and second go another round with the tower, I don't think they'll have time. But unless contradicted, my head canon will be that Stonehell was never the same after the Maastricht Mage's Guild of the Rose arrived in force.<br/><br/>In some ways, this dungeon was a lot easier than Stonehell. But they also did get pretty lucky. They did let the trolls go, and I was pretty worried that they had just lost their chance at pretty much any monetary gain. Those sacks of 9000sp are a lot, but if the trolls take them and leave, then that's it; it's an all-or-nothing venture. Looking at all NPCs as a whole, if the Ricalu thieves had just stayed their hand for the day, the trolls would have got away. I'm still not sure if that invisible back stab was excessively revenge-hungry, but the party had just lost them their chance of a giant silver hoard. Maybe the Ricalu were planning on doing the same blue-cloaks-and-ranged-weapons troll-hunting plan, but Dano just couldn't help himself from getting a sneak attack in before they left.<br/><br/>Conversely, if they hadn't let the trolls escape, they would have been a very difficult fight to drive out. And once the players were under the curse, the Ricalu could have just moved their tent and then waited patiently, picking the silver off whoever won the tower (trolls or PCs). I'm not sure how competently I'd have played the Ricalu\u2014I suspect I would have gotten bored, leading to them trying a rash invisible backstab sooner rather than later\u2014but it at least feels like getting the silver or even surviving was not a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>The Ricalu shaman, who cast the blue-blindness spell in the first place, is still alive. I never decided exactly where he were, and in hindsight I think I've written myself into the spot where the sensible conclusion is that he simply went back to their tribe. So if the party dally around the tower for long, he might arrive with some more blue-clad warriors... But on the other hand, they are likely to get there while the party is in Maastricht; find everyone gone, search the now mostly harmless tower for a few days, and then leave. Perhaps even lifting the curse. Yeah, I'll determine a possible time range for when this happens, roll for it, and then we'll see if the party gets back there before or after that happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476165/#Comment_476165" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-16T11:42:44+00:00" title="August 16, 2018 11:42AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, counting this tower the 1500 limit is very reasonable. It's possible to have an otherwise "successful" adventure here and not gain a whole level, but most likely it's as you say: it's a question of how long / how much effort until you get the big score, not how many sessions of small scores it will take. Stonehell level 1 is definitely harsher, but I <i>have</i> eyeballed the larger treasures and they <i>would</i> have gotten to 2nd level after 4\u20136 sessions if they were a bit luckier. The "dragon" is definitely defeatable, and its "hoard" consists of a bunch of copper coins and an ornate circlet worth 1100sp. So that alone is a good chunk of a level-up, and only requires either defeating a 3 HD creature, or distracting it long enough to search its cave (once the circlet is found, it's super easy to sneak out of there with since it's not large or heavy).<br/><br/>I stand by our decision to change things to suit a group who want to see character progression in this time-frame, though. This same group might have been willing to slog on with no change if the plan for the future was a weekly session indefinitely, but a distribution of big scores "every 10 sessions or so" looks very different from the perspective of 6 sessions in, no visible progress (they figured the mapping knowledge was off-set by angering the Black Bears), and 2 more sessions to go.<br/><br/>It's funny, I actually mentioned several times early on that while they would get XP for encounters, I expect it to dwarfed by the amounts they get from treasure. But then they found such paltry treasure, so I guess to some extents the group's expectations were tempered to that of the steady encounter XP flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476186/#Comment_476186" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-18T09:39:05+00:00" title="August 18, 2018  9:39AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interlude: The Spell Research Fellows of the Guild of the Rose<br/><br/>The party decides to let the exile in the canoe go about his business without charming him, and keeps moving. They get back to Maastricht in like five days, without further encounters. They cash in their big score (1501 sp each) for the single-adventure-capped 150 XP, and all level up!<br/><br/>We spend quite some time thinking up new Sage initiations. Gotbert Royston and Bo\xfer\xfan each take a "magical school" initiation, allowing them to research, learn, cast and prepare higher-level spells, but only from within their respective chosen schools of fire magic and illusions. Maarten takes an initiation allowing him to determine the properties of magic objects, provided ample time and a place to do research. Roos steps up to the responsibility of Guild leader and takes the Haggler initiation, allowing her a Charisma roll to haggle down prices\u2014useful when buying equipment in bulk.<br/><br/>Ren\xe9e's player, as well as the guest player with the nameless mage from last session, were not available so we don't get to see their progression to level 2.<br/><br/>We also hash out the magic rules, which I consider a "test run" and will revise a little if I run this system again:<br/>- Every magician with a spell book (i.e. everyone with Goetia, at the very least) gets to research one new spell per level.<br/>- This research takes 4d6 days per level of the spell, but doesn't cost anything except food and lodging.<br/>- The spell they research is random: they get to roll one spell from the original 21 1st-level spell list, and then one result among all spells they have access to through their comrades, and choose one of them. So for example, Roos rolled up Magic Missile from the 1st-level list, then rolled one random spell among Spider Climb, Summon, Enlarge, Control doors and Charm person (I don't remember what she rolled because she chose magic missile).<br/>- The players who chose a specific magic school got the option of skipping the rolls, and instead learn a 2nd-level spell from their chosen schools. (The schools are narrow enough that, at least as far as self-propelled research is concerned, there is only one spell on each level they can get. Gotbert got Protection from fire\u2014he mainly chose this school with the 3rd-level Fireball as his goal. Bo\xfer\xfan got Invisibility, which is 2nd level.)<br/><br/>In contrast, magicians cannot simply teach their spells to each other. This random roll, made once per level, represents the fact that they are always trying to learn from each other but that it's very hard. We talked about a "magical mentor" Initiation that let you teach your spells to others (conversely one could imagine a "magical student" Initiation that made it easier to learn others') but no-one took it at this point.<br/><br/>However, if the players find magical manuscripts in e.g. a wizard's tower, I want them to have a slightly better chance of learning them than just including them in the second random roll. I haven't decided yet exactly how, and I'm having some trouble reconciling it with the fact that I want a new mage character's starting spell to be a protected resource at least for a while. I guess I could say that almost any magical texts worth finding are those written by people who have for all intents and purposes taken the "magical mentor" Initiation, so the ones found in pre-written modules are considered to fall in this category. Hm.<br/><br/>I'm also not entirely sure of the automatic Goetia-driven research on each level-up, either. Aesthetically I'm not very fond of generic "magic reagents" costs, that simply serve as a money sink, but I can see how they make sense from a game design perspective. Right now I'm considering a model where finding the spell research of a different magic-user (i.e. not a new PC with the same Goetia as you, but either a high-level NPC from your own school, a goblin druid with some new perspectives, or anything in between) is what gives you the opportunity to roll for some spell research. Essentially, spell research is either done on your own, requiring only paper and ink, and then you very quickly get to the point where you can't progress on your own... or you do it by getting out there and finding other magic-users or old, forgotten manuscripts. I have already pushed the angle that the spell book each PC lugs around isn't just a list of recipes (which would be a very short read for a starting player with only one spell), but rather a large collection of notes on magic in general, mostly impenetrable to others, with specific spells being a very small part. It then makes sense that the gain from finding the "spell book" of a master of old, rather than just a few new spells to copy down (and hoping there aren't too many duplicates of ones you already have), is the breakthroughs it allows you in your own research, represented by allowing you to research some new spells, weighed towards ones mastered by the original author.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the sort of magic system I would want in the future. This session, we had everyone research one new spell\u20141st-level for the ones who stuck with only Goetia, 2nd-level for the ones who took a higher-level magic school Initiation\u2014and that's that. In addition to the already mentioned Bo\xfer\xfan's Invisibility, Gotbert's Protection from fire and Roos' Magic missile, Maarten learns Remove fear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Then they get to fitting out their next expedition. The Guild members pay half their share to the Guild coffers, which are used for expenses: food, better armour, a large tent, a mule, and a month's wages for Nodwick the labourer, hired to carry equipment and mind the camp in their absence, including minding the animals. There are separate retainer types in LotFP for both animal handlers and teamsters (packing experts), but they are not required on this small scale.<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan, who has never officially joined the guild, buys her own mule, her own armour, supplies her own food, and keeps the same tent she has always used. She does, however, join the return expedition to the tower.<br/><br/>They ferry across the river right outside the city, and then start trekking back the same route. They encounter a pack of wild dogs which they lose by giving up a ration, but otherwise the travel (now four days since they are not encumbered) is uneventful. They make camp by some large rocks about an hour's walk from the tower, to avoid having their tent completely out in the open on the plains, and leave Nodwick with the mules. About two hours into the session, they reach the tower.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476204/#Comment_476204" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-18T22:44:02+00:00" title="August 18, 2018 10:44PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2018 4:33PM by JonatanK.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 10: The Final Work of Titardinal the Kastromancer<br/><br/>The blue tent behind the tower is gone. They enter the tower, and don't find any obvious signs of anyone else having been here. They start walking the sequence of numbered rooms, getting to room VI without any trouble at all. Remember: entering room I conjures a small spark that follows you around, growing slightly for every room you enter in sequence.<br/><br/>The next room behind room VI is a large, round room with a central fountain, shaped like a coiled snake on top of a high pedestal. It turns out to be room VII, so their sparks grow another small step as they enter.<br/><br/>Gotbert investigates the window: it's on the 5th floor, facing north. As they search the room, the water in the fountain starts moving, and suddenly something emerges! It's a blue, shimmering sort of creature, looking almost like it's formed from the water itself. It has the upper body of a woman, but its lower body is like a snake. It climbs out of the fountain and heads for Roos. They try to hail it but it doesn't answer, so they draw their weapons. Gotbert identifies the creature as an undine, a water spirit.<br/><br/>The undine attacks Roos, grappling and seemingly trying to drown her, but it's attention is not actually on her: it snatches her glowing spark out of the air and cups it in its hands, and then retreats toward the fountain. Maarten is worried: it might have a way of canalising the magical power accumulated in that spark, maybe it will cast a spell or something? He attacks it with his iron-bound staff before it reaches the water, and the undine goes down quickly. The water stirs, and two more undines emerge. They are, however, quickly despatched with now that the party is in combat mode. (30 XP)<br/><br/>They take a closer look into the fountain. It's too deep for Gotbert to reach the bottom with his staff, but they can see something glimmering down there. It looks like a sword and a suit of armour. Roos removes the half-plate armour she took off the troll, ties a rope around her waist and dives in.<br/><br/>Turns out the undines were not gone forever! The water itself fights her, and forces itself into her mouth and nose. The others quickly pull her up. The water is stirring, and Gotbert has an idea: he puts on the circlet he found among the silver loot. It helps him see clearly (it dispelled the blue-blindness before, at least) and true enough, he sees a much clearer vision of the undine than the vaguely person-shaped mass of water the others see. It looks into his eyes and starts talking\u2014bubbling and whining noises\u2014but it also seems to try to commune with him magically. I say he can expend one of his spell slots to accept the communication, which he does.<br/><br/>The undine accuse them of stealing their power: the sparks are drawn from the water spirits of the lake, and they only seek to reclaim them. Gotbert claims ignorance (Bo\xfer\xfan <br/> is especially bothered by accusations of theft without so much as an attempt to prove intent) so the undine asks him if his party are not the followers of the late magister and architect of this place, come to finish his work? They say no. The undines tell a tale of trickery: the architect lured some of them to roost in this fountain and asked them all sorts of questions about the lake spirits, feigning innocent curiosity. When they realised he was out to enslave them and draw their power, it was too late, and the ones in the fountain were trapped. They tell Gotbert that his friend (Roos) can have their treasures (the sword and armour), but only if they destroy the accursed altar! They vow to do so, and the undine recedes into the water once again.<br/><br/>They keep exploring, finding room VIII next to the fountain room. The next room has a large staircase leading up to an upper landing, and then even further, each side of the stairs adorned with large statues of people: a robed man, a man in a bird mask, a commoner holding a bowl, and a chieftain of war wearing a bear pelt. This is in truth room XIII, but they only search below the stairs so they don't find the numeral\u2014but due to Maarten's spark winking out upon entering, they deduce that it is not room IX. As Bo\xfer\xfan looks into the eyes of one of the statues, it seems for a second that something sinister looks back... but she dismisses it as a trick of the light.<br/><br/>They do find room IX at the other end of a long corridor. It is a large stable-like room, filled with smells and noises of the giant dire pelicans that roost here. There are four large windows, quite next to each other, out of each of which a different view can be seen. The floor is covered by reeds, straw and bird poop, and the birds seem very dangerous. There are two other exits, and after some more exploration the party figures that they will have to go through here to find room X.<br/><br/>They start by digging through their rations for any fish they happen to have. We decide that since they set out from a city located on a river, any generic "ration" designed to last several days will probably be about 1/3 dried fish. They left most of their food at their base camp, but they have a few pieces to use as bait. Gotbert braves the giant birds, and walks into their home waving a fish around. He immediately gets their attention, and manages to lure them out one by one by throwing fish out the windows. However, when he's used up all his fish there are three pelicans still in the room. The party attacks.<br/><br/>The fight is tense, as the pelicans each have two attacks: one wing attack dealing 1d4 damage and knocking their opponent prone, and one biting attack dealing 1d10 damage. However, with their new armour (ACs of 26\u201328 all around) and 2 HD, the party hold their own. They use any extra successes on their attack rolls to drive the birds toward the windows, and actually manage to get the birds up on the windowsills so that they block the returning pelicans from getting in. In this way they keep the fight 4-vs-2, and win the day when the last pelican loses their morale roll and flies off. (210 XP).<br/><br/>They search the room and find a giant pelican jawbone with venomous barbs, and a strange flask containing an unknown potion. Maarten, with his new initiation, will later identify this as a <i>potion of leaping</i>.<br/><br/>They find room X on the other side of the pelican room. From there they walk down a corridor with an obvious "pit trap": just very deep pit stretching across the corridor, about 6' long. Maarten clambers around it with Spider Climb to ensure the ground on the other side is stable, and then the others just jump over.<br/><br/>They find room XI and XII, and then find themselves coming into the large room with the stairs and the statues (the one that was not room IX). Unsurprisingly (at this point), it's room XIII. They walk straight through it to room XIV, and further on down some stairs to room XV. This turns out to be the bottom of the troll's garbage chute\u2014which checks out, since the top of the same chute was located in room XVI. They must climb up the garbage chute.<br/><br/>They rest to regain some spells, and then Maarten casts Spider Climb on both Roos and Gotbert, who quickly climb up. They discover to their surprise, that room XVI looks much larger now. Then they figure out that it is they who have shrunk to half their original size! Their equipment has shrunk too, so their plan of throwing down a rope to help the others up doesn't work: the rope was 50' but is now only 25' (and half as strong), and the chute is 40' long <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan goes around another route to room XIV, and confirms that Gotbert and Roos are now half their original size. In order to complete the ritual, they must pass through the shrinking funnel. They would much prefer to continue full-sized, since they are convinced they will have to clamber from window to window outside the tower at some point.<br/><br/>(solution will be printed in next issue)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476210/#Comment_476210" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-19T14:56:49+00:00" title="August 19, 2018  2:56PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2018 4:33PM by JonatanK.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The solution is obvious after some thought. First, thrown down the rope to make it normal size. Then bring it around and throw it down again, making it 100' long (albeit a bit unwieldy). Tie it around a wall section (luckily, rooms XVI and XVII has a simple wall between them with two doors in it, so they can pass the rope around through both and tie it to itself. Then, let the shrunken Roos and Gotbert climb down, to restore them to normal. Then, have everyone climb down, to enlarge them to double normal size. Finally, go back to the beginning, pass through rooms I through XV, and climb up. Now everyone is in room XVI, normal-sized, ready to rock. They leave the rope hanging down the chute, though, in case they mess up the room order and need to retrace the whole thing again.<br/><br/>(In the last post, I forgot one thing: after they fight with the pelicans, they decided they were too low on HP and they didn't want to waste so much good bird meat, so they spent some time showing pelican carcasses out the windows and hauling them back to camp, and then resting for the night. Nodwick got his day's work cut out for him as a butcher\u2014I said he doesn't really have the competence but doesn't mind doing his best for the pay they give him\u2014and they went back to the tower the next day. They found the single escaped pelican had returned, and quickly brought it down by storming its roost with bows at the ready.)<br/><br/>Another solution they tried was to put on the silver circlet, since they didn't really know at this stage whether its ability was "dispel enchantments and illusions" or "see clearly", although the encounter with the undine had given a hint. Nothing happened, which confirmed it as a <i>circlet of clear sight</i>.<br/><br/>They move on through rooms XVII and XVIII, and quickly find room XIX which has the 5th-floor window to the south. Then they go to the known room XX, and from there find room XXI down some stairs. Here the trail ends, though. The only exit leads back through room XX, which would end the ritual. But this can't be the last room, since they found room XXIII before. But of course, there is a window. It faces the east on the fifth floor, and they haven't actually seen the 4th-floor east-facing window. Roos climbs down. It's not trivial, even with the chain hanging down, but she makes it onto the windowsill below. The room seems to be a study: there are withered tomes and documents lying all over, some fluttering in the wind, and a stone desk. She spots the numeral XXII on the floor, and jumps in. The others climb down as well\u2014easier now that they have someone helping from below.<br/><br/>They take a quick look at the documents. Some are general writings on the nature of magic\u2014if they gather up enough of them and get them home, they could probably uncover some new spells. This is the tower's true treasure! There are also many maps, showing alternate layouts of the castle rooms. All of them have a 24th room somewhere, but that seems to be the highest number.<br/><br/>They explore the staircase leading out of the room, but find themselves looking into room XIV. However, they know where room XXIII is, and that it has two windows. They hazard a guess that one of them will be the 3rd-floor east-facing one, and they find as they climb down that they are correct. Everyone gathers in room XXIII and try to figure out where to go next.<br/><br/>There are now unexplored passageways, except for the two locked wooden doors they have found\u2014but those are likely the same door, which they ran into once from each side. And even if it they really were different doors, leading to new places, they would have to pass through at least rooms VII and VIII to reach one of the doors, or rooms IX and X to reach the other. If they enter any numbered room but XXIV now, they will lose their sparks (which are now almost as bright as torches) and have to start over.<br/><br/>They only recourse is, again the windows. They have the 3-rd floor eastern window and the 5th-floor southern window in this room. At first they think that the 3rd-floor southern window is missing from their map, and Roos climbs down two floors to look in, but this was a mistake in their map-making, since that window led to room XIX and they ought to have known this. Roos climbs up again, and they realise that there are two places left to go: up on the roof, or down to the 1st-floor windows. When seen from the outside, the tower has four windows on the 1st floor (counting from above the ground floor), but they haven't found any of them. They decide to try to climb there.<br/><br/>They climb past the pelican stables\u2014very glad that they killed all the pelicans earlier\u2014and down into the 1st-floor window from the east. Roos goes first, and shouts her report: it's a large round room, spanning the entire breadth of the tower, with four windows. That's right: for once, the tower is no larger on the inside than on the outside. In the middle of the room is a steep ladder leading to a metal hatch. She did not lose her spark by stepping inside, so this must either be room XXIV or a non-numbered room.<br/><br/>Gotbert is next, but he rolls the first real climbing failure, and falls to the floor from the 2nd-floor window\u201440', for 4d6 damage! He goes below 0 HP, but makes his injury saves. It's a minor injury, so we decide that he essentially had a semi-controlled fall where he grabbed both the windowsill and the front doors, which they had left wide open, on his way down. He's pretty bruised, for -2 Strength and Wits for a few days, but he's soon up.<br/><br/>Maarten and Bo\xfer\xfan get down to the 1st floor safely, and then they take a short rest. Gotbert still has his spark (I forgot the rules\u2014in hindsight I think it should have disappeared when he touched the ground outside the tower) so he decides it's easier to climb up the outside of the tower rather than run the whole course again (I'm not so sure personally, since the tower is essentially safe now, but I guess there would be a few more climbing rolls involved the other way.) There's a side building with a slightly sloped roof, only reaching up to below the 1st-floor window on the west side, so he starts by getting onto that. Then he goes for the western window, where his comrades can help him up. I think he fails one roll and falls partway for 1d6 damage, but eventuella he gets up to the others with a non-zero hit point total.<br/><br/>They debate whether to spend the night here, but decide against it on the basis of impatience and the possibility that the tower is haunted. Roos takes point as they carefully open the hatch.<br/><br/>(part 10 part 3 in a separate post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476211/#Comment_476211" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-19T15:36:47+00:00" title="August 19, 2018  3:36PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2018 4:33PM by JonatanK.">edited August 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They find themselves on the roof. Where else was there left to go? (They could have tried to get there directly from the 5th-floor window in room XXIII, but that would have been a dangerous free-hand climb (no chain) with very high stakes.) As they exit the hatch, their sparks grow a final step, and they find the numeral "XXIV" carved into the floor. There is a simple stone altar in the center. They also notice that part of the roof has collapsed, but nothing of interest has been laid bare by the missing crenellation section.<br/><br/>Gotbert dons his circlet of clear sight, and is unsurprised to see that the altar glows with magic energy. Slightly more interesting is the great power stirring beneath the lake. He finds himself drawn to the altar, and intuitively knows just where to place his hands in order to complete the ritual. The mages discuss what to do. They did promise to destroy the altar and release the water spirits from their bondage. But how? It's a solid block of stone. In the end, however, the winning argument is one of curiosity: they simply cannot bear doing all this work and then not see what the ritual does. Gotbert volunteers to place his hands on the altar.<br/><br/>His spark dissolves into a soft glow, which diffuses through the altar. The power of the lake starts to move faster, and rise towards the surface. The other mages, who aren't wearing the circlet, simply see a storm whipping up and eventually a tornade forming above the surface of the lake. Gotbert sees the terrible spirit in the middle of it, who turns to face him. Then, it bows its head.<br/><br/>"You have bound me by your spell, and I must do your bidding." Gotbert hears its words inside his head.<br/><br/>"What if I don't want that? We promised the water spirits to free you!"<br/><br/>"So you are not followers of our scourge, Titardinal the Kastromancer?"<br/><br/>"Never heard of him!"<br/><br/>"So you will destroy the altar?"<br/><br/>"Yes, but how? Could we use your power?"<br/><br/>"Would you? Oh, happy day! Just say the command!"<br/><br/>The spirit is bound by the spell and cannot do anything but move on to the next stage. Gotbert feels the power surging up towards him, and realises he has a moment where he can let go. He takes his hands off the altar. The power fades, and the water starts subsiding. His spark is gone; reclaimed by the lake. To use a technical term of ritual magic, he chickened out.<br/><br/><br/>Roos makes a half-hearted attempt to attack the altar with a magic missile. It seems unaffacted. They have no other ideas, so she decides she will complete what Gotbert couldn't, and use the water spirit's power to destroy the altar itself. She places her hands on the altar, and when the moment comes, she holds fast. The power surge almost knocks her off her feet: 1d8 damage, Will save for half. Gotbert would have died, weakened from his climbing accident. But Roos powers through.<br/><br/>The module says the ritual grants a <i>wish</i>. I play this as the spirit telling Roos "State your heart's desire" and then I start a 30-second timer at the table. Decide quickly. Wasting no time, Roos' player immediately says "destroy the altar, without harming me in any way".<br/><br/>The altar shatters, and the tower starts to crumble! Everyone scrambles for the hatch, and then to the western window, seeking to climb down onto the annex roof and down from there (where Gotbert climbed up before). Everything is collapsing, and everyone except Roos has to save against falling stone blocks. Gotbert takes a hit but gets lucky with the damage roll, and survives. Bo\xfer\xfan hesitates, thinking about climbing <i>up</i> to save the magic texts, but when push comes to shove she values her own life higher and saves herself. Roos has the same idea, but doesn't want to push the "without harming me" condition by going back into a collapsing tower. They gather in front of the tower and watch their dreams crumble.<br/><br/>Bo\xfer\xfan yells at Roos until she runs out of expletives, and then switches to another language. How could she? Such a great treasure, destroyed! When the storm abates once more, and the collapse has run its course, they are left with the outer walls of the bottom floor mostly intact. The entrance hall just inside the doors seems to be the same room, but both doors leading further in are buried in rubble.<br/><br/><br/>We switch to a sort of epilogue mode, and I say that the Guild can of course mount an excavation. They will find most of the rooms that were inside the tower, but not in the same order\u2014essentially, every single door and window of the tower was a magic portal. They will find the fountain, now dried up, but the sword and armour still there. They might even find the study eventually, and within it some texts that can still be salvaged, but the rain seeping down through the rubble will ruin most of it in the months it will take them find it in the first place. If this had been a longer campaign, I would have negotiated a price and a time schedule for the excavation, and asked if they wanted to begin their next adventure in the meantime, or advance the campaign calendar and find out what's salvaged. In this short campaign, I just decided that any such excavation is beyond the scope, and will probably happen but not while we're around to see it.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be the last session, and for Maarten's player it was. But the rest of us decided to squeeze in one more session on Sunday (this was on Friday), before my vacation ends and I go back to work on Monday. So when I'm writing this, we have just finished another session, which we took to be an expedition Gotbert, Roos and some new recruits mounted while Maarten, Ren\xe9e and Bo\xfer\xfan oversaw the excavation of the tower. So join us next time for an encore chapter of the first season!<br/><br/><br/>Even though some of the players would be returning, I kept my promise and spilled some of the beans on the adventure locations they'd been to. Mostly I just repeated the stuff I've written in my GM-perspective asides in these reports. And I'm glad to say that I haven't said almost anything about Stonehell levels 2 and down, so I'm sticking to my plan of mounting a full-scale Stonehell campaign at some point in the future. But more about that in one of my post-mortem posts I'm planning for later. Before that, I have to give you Part 11: The Dragon Monastery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476212/#Comment_476212" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-19T16:22:44+00:00" title="August 19, 2018  4:22PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's pretty fitting that you did both Stonehell and this other adventure as part of your OSR experiment, as they contrast well as examples of different types of adventuring content that different adventure designs offer.

One of Jonatan's players here (I played Dan/the father/the bearded berserk/Maarten). Quite interresting to read things from this perspective after having played through it all (well, most of it, since I had to be away for a little bit). Oh, and also the one who wanted to keep my RPGs and (Miniature) Wargames separate <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> (My view of hirelings in RPGs is that they're for guarding the horses/mules (so that they can be temporarily forgotten and still be there once it's time to leave) and filling roles that cannot be done with the current party, such as scout or lock-pick in case nobody's done that, and that is only with great reluctance once all other options has been tried).<br/><br/>I must say, I enjoyed the tower much more than Stonehell, at least as an RPG scenario. Much more suitable to the whole "small band of plucky fools poke things they shouldn't" that I prefer.<br/><br/>It was also quite interresting (once I stopped feeling bad for being the initial voice of it) to watch how morale collapsed (or at least slid downwards) after the death of Nameless. Changing track to the tower was quite possibly the best thing we ever could do. Gave a very satisfiable end point, even if we did manage to screw up the whole "find the magical secrets" part...<br/><br/>Now, if I ever were to "play" a megadungeon again, it will be in full Frostgrave mode. One of the PCs will be the Captain, undisputed leader and boss (I can graciously and humbly acquiesce to this role), the other PCs will be their magical firepower and main enforcers to keep the rabble in line. Any actual fighting and exploring will be done by hirelings/henchmen, with the main guys only going into the frontline in truly dire situations (and then, only if they can't run away). I will of course need solid and well known rules for how to get new hirelings and how to handle them during combat <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>That said, I don't know if I ever will (as an RPG, I think Stonehell would be one hell of an excellent Frostgrave campaign, pardon the pun), but I might be convinced to be the GM for one...

A new guest player rolled up Leofric, who despite his interest in plants has the same Goetia initiation as the other guild members, with the starting spell of Spider Climb. Bo\xfer\xfan's player decided to retire her to safety\u2014he has never lost a character, or even had a major injury\u2014and rolled up Luciano.<br/><br/><br/>The Rose Guild's great excavation of the once-mighty tower of Titardinal is left under the capable supervision of Maarten, Ren\xe9e and the nameless mage, while Roos and Gotbert go on another adventure with some new allies. They travel all the way down to Geneva, and begin their trek up into the western Alps. There is an outstanding reward for returning the lost ceremonial crest of the House di Alfero, and the latest intelligence that has surfaced says it was given away\u2014perhaps a drunken wager, perhaps a misguided donation\u2014and ended up in a reclusive monastery that has since been abandoned after some plague or other. Anyway, the reward is for 20 gold pieces (no less than 1000 sp), and the monastery might well hold unspoiled riches or mystical secrets as well if they're lucky!<br/><br/>In the interest of a one-shot, we forgo random encounters on the travel to the monastery, but they have to show their work re: bringing enough food. They bring the Guild's mule (but not Nodwick), and since the journey is about 10 days both ways through not-so-lush terrain they have to pack quite a lot of food and animal feed.<br/><br/>They eventually find the old trail leading up to the monastery and follow it for the last day or so, reaching the gatehouse on the eleventh morning. It is situated among high ragged cliffs, and seems to be only a small defensive post and the entrance to a larger complex hidden inside the mountain. They quickly realise that front doors are missing: there's an opening, but the doors themselves have been taken of their hinges and removed. As they enter, they see that the same is true of all doors inside.<br/><br/>They enter a corridor that leads straight ahead into the mountain, and they sight what looks like daylight in the end of the tunnel. There are also empty door openings to two other rooms in the gatehouse itself. They explore, and find the rooms almost completely empty. No furniture of any kind. Leofric quickly distinguishes himself as an expert searcher, finding a small candle, a copper coin, and a crude ceramic oil lamp among the dust and cobwebs.<br/><br/>They find a staircase leading up to the second floor, where there's a kitchen (just as empty except for a stone oven) and a ladder to the roof. Lillesippa and Leofric go up, and looking out over the cliffs, Lillesippa can't resist letting out her <a href="http://ronja-the-robbers-daughter.wikia.com/wiki/The_call_of_Spring_(song)" rel="nofollow">call of Spring</a> (even though it's late September). After a moment, they hear the cry of some beast echo between the cliffs in response. Lillesippa and the mystery creature have a short shouting match, before Leofric spots it: a red dragon, the size of a small horse, perched atop the cliff behind them. It leaps out and spreads its wings.<br/><br/>Leofric bolts for the ladder, escaping into the room below. Lillesippa draws her axe and turns to face the dragon as it swoops towards her. Its jaws open and she is engulfed by flames, her clothes and skin burning (major injury, ability score loss to the point of unplayability). Miraculously, as the dragon turns around for a second run she manages to both stop, drop and roll, putting out her burning clothes, and escape down the hatch. The dragon is too small to fit down the hatch, and the party quickly goes down to the entrance to get the mule inside. The front door is large enough that the dragon could probably get in, but it wouldn't have much manoeuvrability. They take the mule with them into the tunnel.<br/><br/>They emerge into a hidden ravine, coming out from an opening in the western cliff wall. The path leads straight onto a bridge to the other side, where the monastery itself is visible. About half of the large building appears to be built on a ledge, looking out over the ravine, with the back half inside the cliff. The bridge is broken in two places, with gaps just large enough to make jumping across difficult. However, the ravine floor is only 20' down. The floor is covered by thorny bushes, split by a small stream running along the ravine from south to north. Above them, the cliff walls grows closer the higher they go, so that the sky is only visible through a crack maybe 20' wide. Someone spots a hole in the monastery roof, large enough for the dragon to enter. Probably its roost.<br/><br/>They decide to leave the mule in one of the empty rooms in the gatehouse, since it would be helpless if the dragon were to spot it. Then they climb down from the bridge with the help of a rope. They realise that they only brought one length of rope between them, so they have to take it down to bring it with them, and have someone free-climb up the other side.<br/><br/>Before they can get to the other side, however, they must pass through the thick bushes. Leofric examines the bushes. He has never seen this species before, and finds the long thorns curious\u2014especially after finding a dead mouse, skewered on the thorns, all shrivelled-up. The party bring out their axes and swords and cautiously cut a path through the bushes to the other side. Roos climbs up the cliff easily, and lets down the rope to get the others up.<br/><br/>They find themselves in a cloister running along the ravine, enclosing a courtyard of some sort. The courtyard, however, is completely overgrown with the hanging boughs of a huge tree\u2014drooping down like a willow's, then creeping along the ground like vines. Their leaves and thorns look just like the strange bushes in the ravine.<br/><br/>(part 11 part 2 in a separate post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476264/#Comment_476264" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-21T19:49:06+00:00" title="August 21, 2018  7:49PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The anti-dramatism evident in Lillesippa's unceremonial burning is just lovely.

The pillar-enclosed path goes along the courtyard, so they turn the corner and continue along the south side, to the east. The cloister ends as it meets the ravine wall, but they find a door (sans door) leading into the cliff. They enter into a large room, two storeys high, stinking horribly from a pile of refuse and excrement. They notice points on the walls where large book shelves were once mounted, but like the doors and all other furniture they must have been removed. There is a staircase leading up to a door on the second floor, and they head up.<br/><br/>They find themselves right above the cloister, and here, too, the wall facing the courtyard consists only of pillars and vaults. The tree's branches hang in and spread over the floor here too. They notice that the vine-like branches are swaying slowly to and fro, but there's no wind. Roos tries poking one of them with her sword, and it withdraws, only to swing back a moment later as if to ensnare whatever disturbed it.<br/><br/>Along the outer wall of this second-floor cloister are small cells: likely the living quarters of the monks, long ago. The doors are removed. Luciano and Leofric start searching the cells, but don't find anything of value. Suddenly, they hear someone approaching from up ahead (north). They can't see very clearly through the leaves, but they make out human figures. They hide in the cells. One of them comes into Luciano's cell, dagger drawn, attacking on sight. Luciano fights back, but loses initiative and then rolls a natural 1; he is driven into a corner and at a disadvantage. The others hear the scuffle and ready their ranged weapons, but before they get much done Luciano is struck down: sub-zero HP, failed his injury save, the player chose to have him die outright.<br/><br/>Once the rest of the party pop their heads out and start shooting\u2014Leofric's crossbow, Gotbert's bow, and Roos doubly-prepared magic missile\u2014the four assailants go down quickly. Someone tried to hail them in germanic at some point, but they didn't answer. They seem to be some sort of barbarians, in scruffy clothing (not even any armour to speak of).<br/><br/><br/>This is where we called it for lunch, and when we returned we had some player/character logistics to get to. Lillesippa's player had decided he didn't want to keep playing her, with her abysmal stats and horrible burns. (We also agreed that such burns should actually have killed her, but we weren't confident in our knowledge about burns to make a decisive call either way, or at least I wasn't.) And Luciano was dead. At the same time, Gotbert's player had to leave, while the rest of us wanted to keep playing. Our solution was that Luciano's player took over Gotbert for the session, and Lillesippa's player rolled up a new character after I gave him the pitch: a deserter from the barbarian tribe whose scouting party you just killed. Once the player had agreed to the character concept, I just unloaded a fair amount of information to the players on the basis that I didn't want to focus on "will they/won't they trust the new character" so they would all learn this right away anyway. I didn't see a point in taking the player aside, tell him the situation, and then let him do the exposition, or anything like that.<br/><br/><br/>So the party search the dead, but notice that the tree has started ensnaring the bodies as soon as they fell. As they stand around discussing what to do, another barbarian approaches. She speaks germanic, and introduces herself as Silence. The party are initially suspicious, of course, but they believe her story about having left her tribe because they wouldn't abandon the folly of their dragon-worshipping shaman!<br/><br/>The Grey Wolf tribe had used to roam the mountainsides and forests, mainly living off their hunting. But a month ago or so, the shaman had led them to this place and showed them the dragon, saying this was their new god. Silence had of course been impressed by the dragon just like everyone else, but this "god" didn't really seem to care about them at all. The shaman had made them search the monastery and find everything valuable, collecting it for the dragon's hoard, to no gain for themselves. (Although they haven't been to the cellar\u2014the shaman went there with some of the others and seemed very afraid of something down there, but Silence hasn't found out what.) They make hunting forays out of the ravine but the times are hard. The tribe live in the old chapel, up ahead, with the dragon (that's where the hole in the roof is). The shaman lives in the vestry, just beyond that.<br/><br/>Now, Silence has snuck out and expects her tribesmen to soon notice that she's missing. She wants to either get out of here, or remove the dragon-shaman-party from power. They make a plan, and then the party hide in some cells close to the chapel. Silence goes in, and plays at having been out scouting. "I spotted the intruders, but we need to go in force to have a chance to capture them!" She rolls well on her charisma roll, so they don't catch on. As they pass the downed scouting party, she adds to the hype: "Look, they took down four of our men as if it were nothing! They must be very strong!" She manages to draw 9 of her former comrades away from the chapel, leaving at most 8 inside. The remaining adventurers (except for Lillesippa; the player shouldn't actively play two characters at once, and since she was so badly hurt everyone was fine with her staying hidden in one of the cells) make their move as the hunting party head downstairs.<br/><br/>They ready their ranged weapons, and burst through the door-hole. There are 6 barbarians here, including the shaman in his wolf pelt\u2014and the dragon is half-asleep in the corner.<br/><br/>(part 11 part 3 in a separate post)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476266/#Comment_476266" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-21T20:42:11+00:00" title="August 21, 2018  8:42PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They catch them somewhat by surprise, and with a few lucky shots bring down the shaman before they are mired in melee! They immediately retreat, followed by the dragon.<br/><br/>Gotbert summons a demon in the doorway to hold off the dragon. He searches through the infinite infernal planes where God's eyes do not see, and pulls out... a garish dodecahedron, vibrating with colour, with a horrible proboscis, like a toothed elephant trunk. It appears in the air in a puff of smoke, and he instructs it to stay hovering there, guarding the doorway.<br/><br/>They make their escape along the side of the courtyard (still on the second floor). Silence has by this time lead the hunting party down to the broken bridge, where she shows the rope the adventurers used to climb up. "They must have climbed down here. And look down there, they have cut a path through the bushes!" However, the sounds of fighting upstairs turns the party around, and they go back. They still haven't figured out Silence's ploy, though, so she just follows them back.<br/><br/>Upstairs, the dragon tears through the 2 HD polyhedral demon in less than two turns, and dashes after the three magicians. They have put some distance between them, so they get a few arrows in before the dragon is upon them. When the barbarians get there, Silence runs ahead of them to throw herself into the fight\u2014but joins the mages in attacking the dragon! Although a formidable foe, the many attacks have chipped down its HP, and in the end Gotbert fells it with a blow of his staff. He seizes the moment, and lets out a triumphant cheer to discourage the barbarians. (There are still 16 barbarians left\u2014their surgical strike only killed the shaman and the dragon.) Silence helps out, by speaking to her tribesmen: "Finally, we are free from the folly of Ascha and his treacherous dragon! They led us here only to enrich themselves, but now these great heroes have freed us from our plight!"<br/>(200 XP, for 17 1HD barbarians and 1 3HD dragon)<br/><br/>The barbarians are intimidated, and keep their distance. They are split up in two groups, with half of them still in the chapel, tending to the dead shaman. The party enter the chapel, staring them down until they leave. The party quickly loot the dragon's nest (gold and silver trinkets worth a total of 225sp) but sadly they don't find the ceremonial crest anywhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>We are out of time for the session, and since this really is the last session of the campaign, we go into a Fiasco-like epilogue mode.<br/><br/>Silence becomes the new leader of the Grey Wolves, and leads them out of the accursed ravine and back to their old life. If the campaign had continued, she would have retired from adventuring all the same. It wasn't given from the start, but the way she turned out she was very much a temporary PC.<br/><br/>The Guild cut up the dragon, claiming any particularly valuable or magically interesting parts (like teeth and scales). Roos had been making sewn patches out of red cloth, shaped like roses, for members to sew onto their clothes to show membership. Now, she fashions new ones out of dragon scales!<br/><br/>The guild would probably stay and search the cellars, where (surprise) there are undead. We will never know exactly how it would go, but I'm pretty sure at least someone would survive, and at the very least the Guild had three members safe in Maastricht. So the Rose Guild lives on. If I play in this setting again, I will most likely skip ahead ~20 years, and have the Maastricht Magicians' Guild of the Rose be a minor power (and suitable employer for PCs).<br/><br/>Lillesippa started going by Svartsippa after she was scorched ("lille" means "little" and "svart" means "black"), and because of her penchant for cooking all the wildlife the party fight (she was well known for her stirge barbecue back at Stonehell, if you remember) she claims the dragon meat for her dinner. We speculate about whether dragon meat, dragon blood, or perhaps the raw heart of a slain dragon have magical healing properties. We do not decide on particulars, but Svartsippa changes her name once again: she goes by Draksippa ("drake" means "dragon") and stays here in the mountains. If I play in this setting again, she will have attracted a dragon cult and spawned the first Dragonborn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I will almost certainly write more commentary on the game, but that'll have to wait for another day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476267/#Comment_476267" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-21T21:00:09+00:00" title="August 21, 2018  9:00PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, that was some bold risk-taking there.

I think it was partly the effect of "session's ending soon" that made them go for the best plan that they could execute right now. As GM, I regretted not committing more ahead of time to exactly how the Grey Wolves were organised. In the original, it's a band of kobolds "in thrall" to the dragon, so I wasn't wholly clear on how much these guys were mindless slaves to the dragon/shaman and how much they were actually on board. Similarly, I had the idea that the shaman was the only thing keeping the dragon from eating the tribesmen. We did say at some point that some of Silence's friend had been eaten to make an example earlier on.<br/><br/>Silence did make a high charisma roll after the dragon was killed, so I let them get away with it. But had they killed the dragon just one combat round later, after the barbarians had joined the fray, it probably wouldn't have been possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476288/#Comment_476288" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T10:30:03+00:00" title="August 22, 2018 10:30AM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought that your solutions were legit throughout. The important thing is authenticity, I think - not faithfulness to the original adventure text so much as faithfulness to presenting a relevant and logical scenario, free of value judgements regarding how it plays out. In this regard it doesn't matter if you have a scenario with religious-political barbarians or one with barbarians charmed by a dragon - both are good, so whichever appeals better is just fine.<br/><br/>And yeah, I assumed that you'd let that situation ride on a single Charisma check - that's what I would've done, and what I'd expect as a player. Choosing a plan like this is inherently risky precisely because the crucial social reaction hinges on a single moment, and an implied single roll. The circumstantial difficulty may be low, but you could always roll that '1' and scuttle the whole plan. It has happened, and will happen again.<br/><br/>Bold play, but it worked out, so it's a victory to be enjoyed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476299/#Comment_476299" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T17:56:02+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  5:56PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the chronicle of my OSR experiment is over. I really had a blast! I'll definitely try to find the time to do more i this vein.<br/><br/><br/>Persson, I appreciate you coming here to share your thoughts! I had never heard of Frostgrave before, but that take on Stonehell sounds great <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I would very much enjoy playing in such a campaign if you were to run it\u2014although not in Stonehell specifically since I've already studied it so much. But I would also love to run Stonehell with a party tackling it that way. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by leaving all exploring to the henchmen: I actually agree about the division between RPGs and miniature wargames in the sense that all interaction should happen through your one character. So sure, you could send your mapping troupe ahead to bring you a map, but then you wouldn't know more than what they tell you\u2014and any encounters they have won't give you XP, nor will any gold they find (or at least those NPCs will waste XP shares). So with enough NPC manpower available, I guess you'd have to walk the fine line between staying out of the true dangers, but still participate enough in the adventurous situations to get an XP share of the treasure. Or, I suppose, play it completely risk-averse, forgo treasure XP, but build up an empire of 1st-level characters with all the treasure!<br/>(But that's an extreme point\u2014compared to how you were playing in Stonehell, without any henchmen at all, there's a huge variation to explore before you get to the point where your characters don't "participate in the adventure" enough to get XP shares.)<br/><br/><br/>Paul_T, DannyK and anyone else who's been reading along: thanks for reading! I've enjoyed writing as well as playing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I've been thinking quite a bit about crunch. When I started out playing RPGs in middle and high school, we were playing the Swedish games Eon and Drakar &amp; Demoner. Both are traditional fantasy RPGs, with varying degrees of simulation-focused rules. Both me and several of my friends enjoyed learning complex rules and figuring out their interactions.<br/><br/>At some point I discovered more story-focused games, examples include InSpectres, With Great Power... and Dogs in the Vineyard. Less rules, and more importantly, the rules seemed to be designed around what mattered in play! While I never stopped enjoying the interactions of mechanical systems (among other things I was playing Nomic by email during this time) I was thoroughly convinced that trad games were just badly designed, unable to let go of their simulationist roots where every possible situation needed a rule. I definitely had a bit of an elitist view of games around this time, preferring the indie games that "knew what they wanted to accomplish". A few years into this, Apocalypse World came out, and I was blown away by the fact that the level of thoughtful design I sought could be achieved in a more traditional GM-player split, and without designing the game around a specific type of story (it felt like AW could be used for any post-apoc story in any post-apoc setting, which is quite broad). Through all this, I saw pretty much all crunch as a necessary evil at best.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope my views have been tempered since then. But even if I was as open-minded as I hoped before this campaign, it definitely opened my eyes on one thing. Since the ruleset we started out with had a lot of holes\u2014most notably the Initiations, which said "you can choose among the Fighter Initiations" and then had, like, 2 to choose from\u2014I spent some time each night in our discord channel, hashing out rule additions. I really enjoyed the feeling of building up our rules system to cover more and more! Not in the sense that less and less was up for arbitration (I made about as many off-the-cuff calls about combat positioning etc in the last session as in the first) but in the sense that there was more and more content. In the beginning, we had the explicit rule that all reasonable melee weapons had the same stats (1d6 damage). Halfway through, we were comfortable enough with the system that it didn't feel overwhelming to say that a longer reach than your opponent gives you +1AC. The spell system was were it really took off.<br/><br/>Now, after the campaign, I'm left with a strong drive to clean up my rules doc even more, add in all the things we came up with, and then really fill out the edges! I feel like I could make a great system in advance of my next campaign, whenever that happens! And I probably will. But taking a step back, what happened? Isn't this the exact type of crunch that I decried only a few years ago? I can never capture everything that can happen in the game, so why do I bother? And if I do want a rules-heavy simulationist game, what's wrong with all the ones already out there? Won't I save boatloads of time by running Dnd5, or for that matter Eon or Drakar &amp; Demoner?<br/><br/>For myself, I think the answer is in the feeling of ownership and comfort a home-grown system brings. For every rule in there, either i myself or the players in a session have made the call to use it. There's something really cool about arguing from precedent. many of my rules are in there because "that's what Eero said he was using", and some of those in turn come from "DnD tradition" (although pretty thoroughly examined). But at the level of which I've collected this ruleset, I still think I can say that I've made the choice to include them. In fact, Eon (or any other system) could well turn out to be perfect for my purposes\u2014but I would never know it, because that I have to discover which rules work for me. With any third-party ruleset, there would by a myriad hidden reasons for all the design decisions. With my own rules, developed through play, every rule has at best an explicit reason for being introduced, and at worst a precedent of "we used to play without this, then we introduced it and we liked the results". That offsets pretty much all my previous misgivings about crunch.<br/><br/>(Another point against crunch, that I still subscribe to, is that some players don't enjoy juggling complex mathematical systems in their heads the way I do, and I don't want to scare them away by choosing too complex a game. A crunch-heavy game developed in-house through play over time offsets this too: those players will have ample time to learn the system, and when a new player joins the process means that the current players have a very solid shared understanding of the rules.)<br/><br/>My new project, rules-wise, is to re-write our rules in the form of a constitution and a body of precedent. Maybe that's how Eero keeps his, except its all oral (or at least non-digitized writing)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476303/#Comment_476303" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T19:30:09+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  7:30PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good thoughts on the rules and the virtues and meaningfulness of doing rulings and staying faithful to the process. I myself feel strongly that I do not wish to systematize the nit-picky details; I am not against analytical top-down writing on the principles and broad strokes, but it would be anathema to me to look up wrestling rules in some authority text. If it's not good enough that I remember it, or obvious enough that I reconstruct it on the spot, I might as well improvise something new instead.<br/><br/>My stuff tries to stay oral - there's writing, but it's haphazard and situational treatises created when necessary. For example, I have two pages on how "pseudo-vampirism" works in detail, while there's still no "canonical list of default combat stunts" in existence. Essentially the equivalent of case law records, if we'd like to stretch the common law analogy further. If I were to do a write-up, the rules on how the moon phase influences alchemy would be just about the last thing in the manuscript.<br/><br/>And yeah, I can see how it's cool to have a complexly layered set of precedents to draw from. My own game has historically been relatively flat in this regard: the precedent most of the time is either "I figured out in my chambers that this might be the way to do it", or "D&amp;D tradition usually does it this way" or "we did it this way in the last campaign". It'd be fun to have more "authorities" to draw on, but the players for the most part aren't opinionated enough to bring their own, and I'm usually clear-headed enough to decide for myself whether I want to rely on Mentzer or Gygax on this or that.<br/><br/>Actually, thinking about it, we sort of had an entertaining split-authorities situation in Helsinki - in the campaign where we did a lot of Stonehell, to be specific. Heikki, the GM, had started running OSR D&amp;D after listening to me drone on about it for hours, and after playing with me for a bit, so he was essentially running "in my tradition". However, while he started with my rules, he ultimately disliked them mechanically (the judgements about what degrees of success mean, and the inherent variability in results were not to his liking), so what he did was that he switched to LotFP, which is much more to his tastes. What developed then was a situation where the group had divided mechanical loyalties: some favoured a more freewheeling and mechanically player-engaging game of the sort my rules represented, while others liked to have clear and simple rules with limited options like LotFP offers. I thought that it was fun, the good sort of creative dialogue; at times the opinions grew a bit heated, but never to a point to cause ill feelings. I think that everybody got a lot out of the debates we did on the best rulings to adopt for this or that situation. I ended up writing several treatises on how to do various things in exciting and player-empowering ways in LotFP - rules for ritual magic, ranger skills, special combat techniques, all sorts of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476307/#Comment_476307" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-08-22T20:17:28+00:00" title="August 22, 2018  8:17PM">August 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome thread!

My house system (with which Jonatan's is like 90% identical) is so thoroughly deconstructed that it'd be misleading to name an originating game text. Mostly it's just based on reading them all, distilling the underlying precepts and then reconstructing. Sometimes the reconstruction introduces entirely novel mechanics (like the HP rerolling on rest thing, that's not in any published D&amp;D that I know of).<br/><br/>If I had to pick one, though, I'd say 3rd edition provides the mechanical base chassis: the choice to use universal d20+[modifiers] vs. DC dicing ultimately originates there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482336/#Comment_482336" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T21:16:06+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  9:16PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean we played LL-AEC and I got to third level pretty quickly?
