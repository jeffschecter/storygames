<p><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=862&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">This thread</a> (design elements for a "gateway" game to introduce people to RPG/story games) got me thinking. Here's a sketch of my thoughts so far. </p>
<p>As a reminder/for those not following the other thread, the design elements as discussed there boiled down to approximately these:</p>
<p>1. Numerous hooks into popular culture. Whatever story is used follows a well-known and easy-to-follow genre format, such as a quest, a murder mystery, or television procedural.<br/><br/>2. Does not call itself a "roleplaying game" anywhere, but it is one anyways.<br/><br/>3. Has rules that can be grasped as quickly and easily as Scrabble's rules, which fit on the inside of the box. The game uses a minimum of jargon, and what game terms it does use, are well defined.<br/><br/>4. The game is bought in a box, and all that is needed for play is included. <br/><br/>5. Can be played by any number of people, from two up to six, possibly eight.<br/><br/>6. Fun begins when the box is opened and does not generally let up. Can get up and running into play in 5-10 minutes<br/><br/>7. Extensible in interesting and fun ways, by the buyer or through add-on sales, but not crippleware.<br/><br/>8. Can provide a satisfying play experience in short chunks of time. Can be played and enjoyed in one sitting of two hours or less. The game can be continued through further play, but doesn't have to be.<br/><br/>9. Doesn't require one person to act as rules referee and player of every character not played by the other players and creator of situation and color and setting authority. <br/><br/>10. There's no 'character sheet'. All character attributes can be represented with the physical tools that come with the game.</p>
<p>OK, so here's the sketch. I call the game "Gateway to Adventure: A game of collaborative adventure storytelling" (fulfilling requirement 2). The format is board-and-card (fulfilling requirement 4). The board follows (more or less) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth" rel="nofollow">Hero's Journey</a>, the there-and-back-again outline Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it might even be triangular (departure/initiation/return, or the three-act structure of the beginning where the situation and characters are introduced, the middle where conflict is developed, and the end where it is resolved). Or maybe hexagonal would work better, splitting each part into two. This partially fulfils requirement 1. </p>
<p>At each step along the way there are stacks of cards to draw from, which contain full instructions for what happens, how to play it out, and what to do in the case of success or failure (including moving to the next step around the board), fulfilling requirements 3 and 9.</p>
<p>The setup consists of setting up the board, placing the packs of cards in the clearly indicated spots, and assembling characters. Character creation is also done via cards, drawing for things such as role (fighter, leader, brains of the outfit, fixer etc.), abilities, equipment, background, strengths, weaknesses, and a dilemma/goal for each character (not necessarily all of the above). These cards would replace the "character sheet" and sit in front of each player (fulfilling requirement 10). Sufficient cards are provided to fulfil requirement 5, and also allow for some NPCs (referred to as "minor characters"), who might have a subset of the above Ã¢â‚¬â€œ e.g. just a role, some equipment and some strengths. This approach to character creation also fulfils requirement 6.</p>
<p>Each game has a group "goal" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ S. John Ross's <a href="http://www.io.com/~sjohn/plots.htm" rel="nofollow">Big List of RPG Plots</a> would be helpful here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is played out within the structure shown on the board.</p>
<p>To fulfil the rest of requirement 1 and also requirement 7, there are "core" cards that are applicable cross-genre, and additional card sets for different well-defined genres such as Edwardian adventure, fantasy, space opera, espionage, horrorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The game comes with the core cards and one or two sets of genre cards. Expansion packs consist of additional genres, or additional options for existing genres (in terms of events, minor characters, character abilities, equipmentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦). A guide and some formats are provided for users (or would-be expansion creators) to make their own cards.</p>
<p>Requirement 8 is fulfilled by having optional steps on the board if you want a longer game, and by permitting people to keep/reassemble the same character for subsequent games if they wish to do so.</p>
<p>I don't have any brilliant ideas for task/action resolution but I'm sure someone else will.</p> </div>
