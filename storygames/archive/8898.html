I thought I was like "oh, I know what metagame is."  All mechanics are metagame, aren't they?  The assumption is that "game" in this regard means "in-character" decision making.  All mechanical decision making is metagame, technically.  However, the confusion comes in that we use the term "game mechanic" to describe the rules of the "game."  Metagame mechanic might be a little redundant in reflection of the term "game mechanics."  All game mechanics are metagame.<br/><br/>Another option would be to consider metagame to not be game mechanics, rather social and real life considerations.  So to make a metagame decision you're making it based on real life such as "I'll wait until Jon goes to the bathroom to talk with his in-game adversary."  Or, "I know the GM wants us to have fun and worked hard at this adventure so I should bite at plot hooks."  <br/><br/>I guess, there could be mechanics for that (like flags).  The question becomes when that is turned into a mechanic is it still metagame?<br/><br/>Interesting,<br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196793/#Comment_196793" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T06:45:42+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  6:45AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2009 2:51PM by Valamir.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Story games have blurred the line between game and meta game mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraditionally a game mechanic is a mechanic that impacts the system in a way that is consistant with the fiction.  Its designed to represent the impact of some actual in-game (in-fiction) thing.  When you roll your climbing skill to climb a wall that's a game mechanic because in the fiction it makes sense for your character's ability to climb to impact how well they climb the wall.  Similarly getting a bonus for having a rope is a game mechanic because of course having a rope would help you climb.<br/>\n<br/>\nA metagame mechanic is one that impacts the system because the player (who exists outside the fiction) wants it to, there may be some attempt at a fictional justification, but most often its "just because"<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, earlier when you were fighting the duke you made a witty quip and were rewarded with a hero point.  Now you've failed your climbing roll and decide to spend your hero point to reroll.  What causal relationship did your earlier witty quip have to your ability to climb?  None...its just because...ergo...its a metagame mechanic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite blurry ones is PTA fanmail.  Is it meta?  After all, why does some other player liking what I said an hour ago have to do with my ability to succeed now.  On the other hand...if you view PTA as a game within a game, with the over-game being the production of a tv show than one can imagine a character who receives alot of fan interest being given a bigger role on the show...so maybe its an in-fiction causal thing after all...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196794/#Comment_196794" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T06:51:40+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  6:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Despite my tongue-in-cheekness, I do think the Forge Glossary definition is very good. Paraphrasing only a little, you get: "Rolling dice before you <i>fully</i> describe what happens". That's pretty good, I think.<br><br>Fortune at the End is the method used in traditional roleplaying games:<br><br>1. I want to pick the lock.<br>2. I roll to see whether I pick the lock.<br>3. If I succeed, I pick the lock, like we decided before the roll.<br><br>Fortune in the Middle is more like:<br><br/>1. I want to get into the castle.<br/>2. I roll to see whether I get into the castle.<br/>3. OK, now how exactly did that happen?<br/><br/>Fortune in the Beginning is something more of a problematic term, in my interpretation. It's:<br/><br/>1. Roll dice!<br/>2. OK, now what do the dice tell us about what's going to happen?<br/><br/>It's problematic because it's <i>essentially</i> Fortune in the Middle: there's always <i>something</i> established before the dice roll, then the dice tell you how it changes. It's used very effectively in Bacchanal.<br/><br/>To come back on Andy's point: as I understand it, Psi Run and Otherkind <i>aren't</i> the only real examples. Fortune in the Middle occurs in <i>any</i> game where the dice don't decide <i>exactly</i> what happens.

Basically, "Positioning mechanics" allow the player to adjust Positioning outside of the character's scope of effect (e.g. unallocated relationship dice in Dogs), and/or convert Positioning into Effectiveness (e.g. Artha in the Burning Wheel).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197254/#Comment_197254" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T15:21:00+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  3:21PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite>These days, us hip Forgies call 'em "Positioning mechanics." </blockquote>So<i> that's </i>what the hell you've been talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197523/#Comment_197523" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T21:51:51+00:00" title="March 17, 2009  9:51PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2009 9:53PM by JuddG.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>I think my new game will be Fortune in the Beginning <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nI first read this as "Fortune ONLY in the Beginning", which is not what you wrote, but got me thinking:<br/><br/>Would that be a game system where you roll all the dice at chargen and spend the resources rolled at that time during the game-play?
