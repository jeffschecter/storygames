And, oh yes, it's ready!  You can learn more about the game <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4078" rel="nofollow">in this thread.</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is, essentially, an Ashcan release.  I've had a blast every time I've played this game and so have the other people who've playtested it.  But really, I'm not 100% confident in the design or my writing and I won't be until I've had feedback from a fair few other people and groups.  Hence the Ashcan.  The Bootleg Edition is \xa36, which is also fully refundable against the cost of the finished version if you provide me with useful feedback after running a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's an A5, 82 page comb-bound book with card covers.  It also comes with:<br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]4 sets of 4 Style Cards<br/>\n20 Glory! counters<br/>\n40 Cash counters in denominations of 1 and 5<br/>\n10 Flaming Skull counters<br/>\nA blank Band Roster (in case you can't download and print the one on the website and need to photocopy one)<br/>\nA sheet of blank Non-Player Band sheets (ditto)<br/>\nA copy of the reference guide table thing (ditto)<br/>\nA special* envelope to keep all this stuff together!<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\nI will be uploading some pictures later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be a final release of the game which will be a properly printed, perfect bound book with better finished artwork and massively improved layout and which will incorporate any changes and clarifications required to make the game 666% Awesome.  Exactly when this will happen will be heavily dependent on the speed at which I receive the required feedback from people buying the Ashcan.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you're at Dragonmeet on Saturday, come and say hi!  I'm demoing all day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also egotistical enough to think there are a few of you out there who're not going to Dragonmeet but who still want a copy of this.  Don't panic, I have plans to make this available for everybody willing to participate in the ashcan process!  Just give me a few days after the con to sort that out and make it happen, then I'll post details here<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Specialness of the envelope entirely fictional                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110403/#Comment_110403" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T12:41:47+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 12:41PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what has got me more excited:<br><br>a) Rage Against The Machine getting back together and the fact that I'm going to see them in January*<br>b) The Umlaut Bootleg Edition<br><br>I'm torn.**<br><br>This is great though.
