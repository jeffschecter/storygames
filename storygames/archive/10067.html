We all know what's wrong with the rules, and it's easy to fix (either avoid difficulty 10 and 1, or use the dice rules from Aeon/Trinity and later games).  Use the techniques you've come to enjoy in story games, since the WW system is pretty technique-agnostic. Use the flavor you like from the WW material.

Difficulty is the number of dice &gt;=7, rather than the number you look for on each die. You botch only if you roll zero successes and at least one 1. Tens explode if you're invoking one of your specializations, or whatever you call it when you have a trait at 4+ and you describe it more precisely. I think that's all.<br/><br/>I'd add in the following story games bits:<br/> - Additional successes can be rolled over to later, related tests, or used to narrate in a fact, Donjon-style<br/> - You must fail a roll with a given skill to advance it.<br/> - Hard: Rewrite the adjectives on the wound levels track so that they're distinctive Conditions, ones that can be roleplayed constantly. Use strong adjectives like Exhausted, Enraged, Unconscious, that are easy to portray.<br/> - Specializations are flags, right? Anything a player spends more than, say, 3 build points on, that's a flag too, right?<br/> - Character creation <i>must</i> be done collaboratively. In fact, take away 5 build points from each player. When each player finishes building, have him hand his sheet to his right-hand neighbor, who will spend 5 points to finish the job.<br/> - Play "I don't see it" before you begin the game.<br/> - Write a kicker, or a Mouse Guard-style Belief. Reward its use with XP.<br/> - If you succeed, you narrate. If you fail, someone else does (GM, usually).<br/> - Really stress the crap out of Nature/Demeanor and the Willpower reward cycle. Maybe you get more than one of each? Go after their Willpower with nasty supernatural powers if you must, get them to spend it for auto-success if you can, but somehow, make them ping their <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">keys</span> Nature and Demeanor to stay in the game.<br/> - GM: Fish like crazy, say yes or roll dice, empower players with narrative authority constantly, say "yes, and..." a lot, don't get lazy in your IIEE, be willing to zoom out and do conflict resolution, cut scenes aggressively.<br/> - Players: Accept narrative authority, say "yes, and..." a lot, don't get lazy in your IIEE, suggest a lot, cheer a lot, don't think of the GM as the entertainer, keep the pace up, and let the other players use your character to make things more awesome - they'll return the favor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223361/#Comment_223361" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T22:54:03+00:00" title="August  7, 2009 10:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>For a slightly less annoying variant, use mechanic as Colin described, except 10s are 2 successes instead of explosions.</p>\n<p>Also,</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ul>\n<li>Character creation must be done collaboratively.

I imagine that wouldn't be true if you played just those character-blender published scenarios that Chaosium saw fit to bludgeon us with, using only a 1980-vintage repertoire of technique, right? Surely you sit down at the table with a head full of 21st-century ideas about play, drawn from your improv theatre background as well as from discussion of RPGs in particular, and that's crucial to your enjoyment. All I'm suggesting is that you can make any game, even (especially?) Vampire, more fun in the same way.<br/><br/>And my own experience bears this out. First time I encountered fishing? We were playing AD&amp;D. Flags (as a player)? Mage: The Ascension. Test-to-advance (not quite fail-to-advance)? Call of Cthulhu. Collaborative character creation? Vampire: The Masquerade, Dark Ages in fact, and yes, I wore a helmet. Most astonishing: win the test to win narrative authority / no shortcuts in the fiction?

I mean, it depends what you want from your mystery game. If you want the players to invent the mystery, Inspectres is superb. If you want them to uncover a predetermined mystery, you'll want something else.<br/><br/>Jonathan's suggestion of Dogs is pretty good, especially if you want it to be about moral judgements. If you use Dogs, the mystery will come out right away: the question is, what do you do about it?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224591/#Comment_224591" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T18:19:03+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  6:19PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My vote is "Conspiracy of Shadows" or a Setting Hack of "Fear Itself" (the Gumshoe "victim's rules" game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
