                    So...<br/><br/>For the sake of argument, say I have a Stealth Project. <br/><br/>(I have a Stealth Project)<br/><br/>Now that y'all have gotten that out of your system (pun intended), what would you pay for it, and what would you prefer to pay for? <br/><br/>Over at Wicked Press, I see items for prices I wouldn't pay: $6/16 pages, for example. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I did pay for the novelty of a low-numbered steel-bound Judge Dredd d20. I think it cost me $100 plus postage from the UK to the US. I don't play d20 anymore, but I'm never parting with that book if I have a choice.<br/><br/>Now, I know there are people who would pay for page count. Take that out of the equation. The product is what it is. I won't pad it or trim it. We also have to assume that the game is unique, eminently playable, thoroughly playtested, and something that piques your interest.<br/><br/>I'm looking for ways to attract interest beyond the actual content of the book -- something to draw people who havne't heard of me, or who wouldn't otherwise consider the book for just its content alone. Call it marketing gimmicks if it makes you happy, but I want customers to feel like they're getting something extra for paying a premium. <br/><br/>Here's a few options (feel free to add more if it would increase the price in a way that wouldn't alienate you): <br/><br/>More art: as much as a piece per page/spread, with text designed around the art. <br/>Novelty covers: simple (heavy stock) to complex (special materials) to ridiculous (handmade) <br/>Special paper: see covers above<br/>Special printing: from colored ink only, to specialty inks, to hand calligraphy or something similar<br/>Special supplementals: remember the candy bar from AFMBE? Or the roach from the Roach? <br/><br/>And I guess, most importantly, what's your upper limit? People are already paying $100 for books, and a lot more for stuff that's out of print. If I come out with a very limited edition, what would be the most you would pay? And if I were to release it to a wider audience, as a limited edition owner, would you care whether they had "normal" print copies, or would you prefer they only have access to PDFs?<br/><br/>Now, I realize I'm not all that well known, so feel free to factor that in. <br/>But be sure to put in your upper limit price for the same design by {your favorite author.} <br/><br/>I understand this is very subjective. I expect people to qualify their reactions, but please include dollar values with your comments so I have something to work from.                </div>

                            I ended up getting Dead of Night after hearing AP from folks I respected saying it kicked ass. <br/><br/>Before that I didn't know it existed, and didn't really care. Then one of the Matts and Ron and um... someone else... told me it was cool. Ron posted AP, and next thing you know I'm after the game. <br/><br/>Once I decide I'm going to get the game price matters a lot less than you might think. $25 for 50 pages? If its 50 pages of awesome, I'll probably do it. $45 for Burning Empires, which I know will rock due to Luke, not even a thought about it. If Ron were to do "Ultimate Sorcerer" and put together all the material from the 4 Sorcerer books with all the good shit he's done on the Forge to explain how to make it rock, I'd pay $75 for it, even if it wasn't glossy or cool. <br/><br/>But without that kind of knowing its going to rock, without a personal connection to the author, or without AP and people talking about the awesome that is the game, I don't really care what you offer me to draw my eye. If Ptolus had been $50 and still had all its amazing extras (cause they did rock) I still wouldn't have picked it up.                        </div>

                            In order for me to pay a lot of money for a book it has to:<br/><br/>1) Have really, really good layout.  THIS IS HARDER THAN PEOPLE THINK.<br/>2) Be otherwise aesthetically pleasing, not having crappy looking art or revoltingly bad cheesecake.<br/>3) Be something I know is gonna be fun to play or at least worth mining for ideas that are directly applicable to play.<br/>4) Not be 300+ pages of crap I will never actually use in play.  All killer, no filler. 50 pages of quality is better than 2,000 pages of sludge.  Distill that swill into some high-octane rocket fuel.<br/><br/>Otherwise, yeah, there really is no price cap if it's really something I want.  Obviously, I might not be able to pick it up immediately, but I'll work it into my budget if it's really that good.                        </div>

                            So, Merwin, assuming you have the rest of your ducks in a row e.g. you've produced a game that people enjoy enough to write about it online... I think you can make reasonable, simple assumptions about bling. I mean, Burning Empires was what it was, and was priced where it was, and you can just extrapolate from there.<br/><br/>That said, Burning Empires would have just completely sat there if people hadn't been obsessed with what it produced at the game table. <br/><br/>I just wanted to address that more directly, since you seem to be looking for very specific feedback about the physical properties of a product. First, you're (evidently) asking the wrong crowd; and second, I don't know how useful getting a paltry few data points on dollar values paid for foil covers vs. something else is really going to be for you. Just do something cool and creative and I think you're covered, provided that you have cool play nailed down.                        </div>

                            What Brand says about actual play is spot on. Getting that actual play is hard, though. It was hard for me, anyway. I caught a lucky break when Ron and Vincent played Primetime Adventures at Gen Con. If that hadn't happened, if I hadn't gone, or if they'd played something else, it would have taken me a lot longer to build up awareness.<br/><br/>But you're a presence here, and that's a start in terms of getting people to check out your stuff. They'll be like, oh yeah, that Rumble guy. I like him. Someone here will check the game out, and folks are generally good about posting their experiences, especially if they rock.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff you're listing, I think, works better for shelf browsing. In days of yore when I'd actually shop at brick+mortar stores, I paid attention to design and layout and artwork. There's more than a few indie games that I own that wouldn't have passed that test (maybe my game doesn't pass JonathAn's test).<br/><br/>So, dollar values? The biggest factor right now in indie games pricing, I think, is IPR. Their free-shipping policy means it's usually more expensive to the seller to charge $25 than it is to charge $24, so there's this sea of products all priced around $20-$23 in the catalog. If you want to sell something there, keep that in mind. Package something that you think you can sell for at least $30, or else aim for low 20s.<br/><br/>After that it's all really subjective. I mean really super extra heavily subjective.                        </div>

                            Listen to those folks cherishing actual play. <br/><br/>And, secondly, what is your goal? If it's getting collected, rather than actually played, go nuts with the gimmicks. If it were me, I'd forget any notion that something beyond the basic content of a nicely produced book is needed to boost sales. Sales boosted in that way might get you some more revenue, sure. Will they get your game played? Do you care? (I would!)<br/><br/>Look at your own example. By your own admission, you no longer PLAY d20, and yet cherish a physical object. I may be reading into your post too much, but it sounds like you have the funky Judge Dredd edition because you like Judge Dredd or just like to funky binding or whatever. If I was the designer of Judge Dread (and, clearly, I ain't) I'd consider that a woeful failure.  <br/><br/>It's sorta like a woman who wants to get recognized for who she is, but people keep staring at her breasts when they talk to her. To heck with those guys!<br/><br/>Ok, I'm kidding around. No more. You said:
<blockquote>I'm looking for ways to attract interest beyond the actual content of the book -- something to draw people who havne't heard of me, or who wouldn't otherwise consider the book for just its content alone. Call it marketing gimmicks if it makes you happy, but I want customers to feel like they're getting something extra for paying a premium.</blockquote>
Why? WHY WHY WHY would you want to do this? Seriously consider your answer to that question, because beyond the philosophical and highly opinionated stance I take about it, it also means you're VERY likely to incur a lot of costs to make it happen, and don't really have much guarantee you'll recoup those costs.<br/><br/>Now for the opionated bit ... <br/><br/>Myself, I find the whole concept beyond bizarre.  You want to charge people more money to get something that you yourself admit is for people who aren't interested in your content. <br/><br/>I'm of the personal opinion that this really isn't good for the hobby. But, I sure as hell am not forcing anyone to agree with me.                        </div>

                            Just like others have said before me, the first thing that motivates me is reviews or actual play reports, especially if I have read other evaluations by the same reviewer and generally agreed with these reviews.  The other main motivators for me to buy a book are an author who I already know and like, and specific topics/genres/settings.  But I won't deny that there are some physical qualities to a book that increase my interest:<br/><br/>- As Jonathan Walton said, good crisp layout.  This is different from aesthetics, though a good layout is <b>also</b> aesthetically pleasing.  For example, D&amp;D 3 was beautiful but had a mediocre layout because it was difficult to read.<br/>- Great art (e.g., Mythic Russia).<br/>- Beautiful cover, binding, and paper.<br/><br/>Other than that, gimmicks generally annoy me instead of attracting me.  I hated some of White Wolf's gimmicks in the 90s, such as the claw-rips through the cover of the original Werewolf and the spiral-ound plastic cover on the original printing of Aeon Trinity (without special care, the books disintegrated within days in both cases.)                        </div>

                            Put simply, I'm a collector. There are things I buy simply to have. I usually do have at least a passing interest in the content but all that does is bring the product into my peripheral vision. Then the bling gets me hooked: The Cthulhu library edition, the Dredd steelbound, GURPS Prisoner, the four issues of Inter*Action. <br/><br/>If no one else here is, then I'm definitely in the wrong fishbowl. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>If I get the "right" people to playtest and help push my game, others interested in the content will pick it up. Of this, I have no doubt. But how to reward them, if I only plan to produce a certain number of copies in a premium format? <br/><br/>Or do I not reward them at all -- is the game truly its own reward, and I get to charge as much as I want for it? <br/><br/>Look at this another way: <br/>If I create a premium edition, what would you look for/want?                        </div>

                            Merwin,<br/><br/>I'd pay more for a well-bound book with a good, thick cover. That's partly from an aesthetic view and partly from a practical one: I like books that don't fall apart. I remember when I'd have killed for a hardback copy of Laws Of The Night, because my paperback copy was falling apart.<br/><br/>I'd pay more for a game with cards, dice and minatures included, if they were part of the game. For example, I'd pay more for the Shab al-Hiri Roach boxed set than I would for a (hypothetical) Shab al-Hiri Roach book with push-your-own-cards-out cardstock.<br/><br/>I'd only pay for something <i>really</i> special (say, a mock-leather bound edition) if it was a game I knew really well and loved. There was a time when I'd have bought a mock-leather black book of Laws Of The Night. Now, well, if you offered some version of foil-covered shiny version of Paranoia XP, with a digital thing on it, I might be tempted. But I'd never pay for that kind of overhead on a new game.<br/><br/>I won't pay more for frills, such as the "The Roach" in the Shab al-Hiri Roach or the red tissue paper that wrapped my copy of Breaking The Ice. However, those things make me think that the designer cares, and make me more likely to buy something else from them.<br/><br/>I'll pay more for, say, Shock:, which looks like a beautifully designed book, than I would for a hypothetical ring-bound version of Shock:.<br/><br/>I'll pay more money if some goes to charity.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Actual play is handy, but I'm more likely to buying because there's something to steal, so I'll start with interesting.<br/><br/>There are definitely games for which I've "overpaid", which is to say, paid far in excess of the apparent page count and production.  With the exception of the Game of Thrones Deluxe edition, which was a whole other set of reasoning, I am more likely to do this at a convention, though the reasons for this are mixed.  Having people who can speak about the product definitely helps, but being able to flip through the product also makes a big difference.  My FLGS doesn't shrinkwrap (well, at least one of them doesn't) but they're unlikely to have the smaller games on their shelf, so conventions are the only opportunity I have to physically pick this stuff up.<br/><br/>Two notable examples are both from the Wicked Dead booth: John Wick's "Wilderness of Mirrors" and Annie Rush's "House of Horiku".  I paid $8-10 for Horiku (which is 12 pages, staple bound, no color - very minimal) and I think $20 for Mirrors, which is only a little bit bigger, but has one of the most fantastic covers you will ever see.  I picked both up at Gencon, and had not planned on getting (or had even heard of) either beforehand.<br/><br/>Now, I feel like I got a good deal on both.  Mirrors has proven itself as awesome several times (plus, it has cachet) and Horiku had a cool, steal-able XP mechanic.  But if I were purely crunching the numbers on pages, words and such, both games were ripoffs, so why did I pay the premium?<br/><br/>First off, Mirrors really looked _that_ good.  It makes you _want_ to pick it up.  And as soon as you do, that's an opening for the pitch, which is succinct and interesting.  It's a game for doing one thing - planning intensive espionage - and it's a thing which both interested me and for which I could not think of a ready alternative.  Also, it had John Wick's name on it, which I have faith in.  All in all, it seemed expensive, but it had all the hallmarks that reminded me that I wasn't paying for volume, I was paying for the total product, and once you switch over to that thinking, the sale is easier.<br/><br/>Horiku was an upsell, on fairly spurious grounds.  I had mentioned that the Scorpion book had resulted in me laughing my ass off, so Wick pushed a ninja game on me.  Since I was already engaged with him, and the upsell had reasonable grounds, I failed to politely dismiss it our of hand, so I picked it up to look at it.  Now, in this case, production worked against it.  It's clean and professional, but it's production is within the bounds of what can be accomplished with a binding stapler, some cardstock and a laser printer.  This did not look bad, but since I can do the same thing at home, spending 8 bucks seems overkill.  However, there was definitely a social component, and Annie Rush makes good stuff - her name wasn't as much of a sell as Wick or Sorensen, but it's got legs.  Of all things, I was sold by the character sheet, which used some symbology I was unfamiliar with, but which looked interesting.  That was enough to tip it into the realm of curiosity purchase, where the under $10 price tag was ok.<br/><br/>Now, notably, I was pleased enough with Horiku that I later grabbed another one of Rush's games in a similar format, and it was much less to my taste.  Bad for me, but nicely illustrative of the fact that I had fully made the transition to buying the product.<br/><br/>Buying at the FLGS is similar, except with less engagement, so issues of appearance and layout matter more.  Appearance will  impact whether I pick it up at all.  I am unlikely to buy a game for it's layout, but a game with a good layout is likely to make it easier for me to get a grasp of what it's _about_.  Beyond that though, FLGS shopping kind of exists in a vacuum, which is kind of a shame.  It's worth noting that I'm _less_ likely to buy a funky edition of something at the game store, since it will either be sealed (and thus unavailable to review) or open (and thus probably less pristine than I'd like).  Even more, the cost on hand is almost always going to be too high for an impulse buy.  If I'm getting a deluxe edition, it's because I ordered it.<br/><br/>Anyway, online, is a different ball game.  Among other things, I have the option of ordering a PDF, and when I purely intend to rummage  through a game for ideas, that's not a bad approach.  The shorter the game, the more likely I am to just get the PDF, since longer games are harder to read onscreen.  I am reasonably likely, if I dig a game, to then pursue a print copy, but if I can get a deal on it because I bought the PDF, all the better.  <br/><br/>I will pay more when I feel the company is treating me well, even if it costs them little or nothing.  Matt Snyder made a sale of the revised ed of 9 worlds based pretty much entirely on the classy fashion in which he handled the upgrade from first to revised.  In contrast, EOS press is in the middle of alienating me as a customer at the moment as they released the PDF of their WOTG companion this summer, and printing and shipping problems have meant that the book has still not shipped (and I know this only because I check their boards occasionally).  I can still buy the PDF at full price, though.  <br/><br/>Anyway, bottom line for me:  Gimmicks may sell your first product, or at least catch my eye.  Customer Service is going to sell or not sell your subsequent ones, and if proactive enough, might sell me the first one too.  I might buy you're game because it's awesome.  I'm more likely to buy your game if _you're_ awesome.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Posted By: rumblePut simply, I'm a collector. There are things I buy simply to have. I usually do have at least a passing interest in the content but all that does is bring the product into my peripheral vision. Then the bling gets me hooked: The Cthulhu library edition, the Dredd steelbound, GURPS Prisoner, the four issues of Inter*Action.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
wow someone else with GURPS Prisoner<br/>
I am closer to the collector, in that i try for completeness<br/>
Someone else up there above me in comments said <br/>
<br/>
Other than that, gimmicks generally annoy me instead of attracting me. I hated some of White Wolf's gimmicks in the 90s, such as the claw-rips through the cover of the original Werewolf and the spiral-ound plastic cover on the original printing of Aeon Trinity (without special care, the books disintegrated within days in both cases.) <br/>
<br/>
Now my copy of Aeon Trinity is still intact, and I bought it new back when it was published. So sometimes it will last.<br/>
<br/>
What gets me to buya  book is the content. More the setting than the system. I love the setting only no rules thread btw.<br/>
I own the 2 Iron Kingdom Guides even knowing I wont get a person to game with me in the setting. Because I love the ideas, the look, the feel, the setting, the concepts.<br/>
Same with Mongoose Publicatiosn and WARS:RPG...Loved the art on the cards, bought the book. Wont ever use it, except to pirate stuff from if I ever get to game a SF style d20 game.<br/>
I will buy the next Call of Cthulhu edition, because I love the content, the setting, been reading HPL since Jr High School, there is the continuity.<br/>
So for me to buy something (I cannot get above 45 dollars in a single shot and most days 29.95$ feels too much) it has to appeal to me<br/>
Who will your book appeal to?<br/>
That is my question                        </div>

                            I'm confused. It seems like you're moving your own goal posts a little bit. <br/><br/>First, you said this: 
<blockquote>something to draw people who havne't heard of me, or who wouldn't otherwise consider the book for just its content alone.</blockquote>
Now you're saying this:
<blockquote>If I get the "right" people to playtest and help push my game, others interested in the content will pick it up. Of this, I have no doubt. But how to reward them, if I only plan to produce a certain number of copies in a premium format?</blockquote>
So, first it was attracting collectors who AREN'T interested in the content. And, now it's rewarding customers who ARE interested in the content.<br/><br/>Which is it? Is it both? What's your goal? I'm still not seeing an answer to that fundamental question. No goal too often means failure because you have no means to gauge success.                        </div>

I can't do both? <br/><br/>It's simple. I've invested quite a bit of myself in developing this game so far. I think it'll take another year or two before release, because approaching it drains me quite a bit. <br/><br/>Consequently, I'm not giving it away. <br/>No ashcans, no previews, nothing but the blurb. <br/>I may LOAN copies for review, but that's it. <br/>Well, maybe my brother gets a free copy. <br/><br/>I'm under no illusions -- it's a niche game. I think it will be just as exhausting to play as it was to design.<br/>So I'm going to spend some time doing it right, as best I can. <br/>There WILL be a premium edition. Whether that will be the only edition is another question. <br/><br/>A premium edition will attract a customer's eye if a store picks it up and puts it on the shelf. <br/>Anybody's eye, whether they were interested in or aware of the content in the first place. <br/>And people who are interested in the content will be looking for the publication, premium or not. <br/><br/>"I want to own/play" is different from "That is _so_ cool." <br/>I get that. But I think I can have my cake and eat it too, in this case. <br/><br/>Case in point: <br/>I have Ligotti's Gothic Tales. I keep wanting to purchase it in hardcover, but I already have the paperback. <br/>I suspect that if the paperback didn't exist, I'd own the hardcover. But my motivation for the hardcover is lower now because the paperback exists, and I own it. Not to mention that the hardcover is nearly 5x the cost of the paperback. <br/>The softcover is "I want to own/read". The hardcover is "That is _so_ cool." <br/>If the softcover didn't exist, I wouldn't have to make the choice. I'd own something _so_ cool that I could read anytime desired.

                            So, here's what a premium version is for me:<br/><br/>Boxed Set. The rulebook. A small "pitch" pamphlet for me to give to potential players. All dice necessary to play. All other props. Printed, colour character sheets. "Con packs" with pre-gens and scenarios. A soundtrack CD. A DVD with an actual play session.<br/><br/>...most of that is pretty basic, and can be printed from a home printer, yet I'd pay double or more on the total product.                        </div>

                            I don't know if I'd do a premium version of Panty Explosion, but Matt and I have talked about doing a deluxe edition. Is that the same thing? What I'd like to do is:<br/>
<br/>
Fix all the spelling and grammer errors (premium!)<br/>
<br/>
Add in the other 30 pages of background info we cut.<br/>
<br/>
Do way more art (I was sick during the time I had alloted for art and never got to draw half the stuff I wanted)<br/>
<br/>
Include information on playing male characters, playing without a Superintendent, playing through an entire school year and other stuff that we just never got around to.<br/>
<br/>
Add in a easy to photo copy reference sheet.<br/>
<br/>
I think thats about it. In my mind thats not a premium edition, but a new edition that replaces the old one.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what I would do for a premium edition. Panty explosion is already designed to look like a school notebook (with rounded corners and lined pages). We could spiral bind it to get the full effect, but really I hate spriral binding. Matt and I had talked about handing out a pair of panties with the games logo on them whenever some one bought a copy of the book. That seems premium to me.<br/>
<br/>
I think its more a question of what is approprate to the book. I don't think theres anything wrong with putting together a nice package, especially if the project calls for it. It's a mistake to do gimmick stuff just for the sake of having the gimmick. Not every game benefits from foil stamping, weird binding or a hardcover.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe that without knowing what your game is actually about it's hard for any of us to give you the kind of feedback you want beyond encouraging you to make sure the editing, layout, design and artwork are as good as you can make them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But here's something interesting. Linda Meddly recently released a hardcover version of castle Waiting (a comic). It's a very high quality hardcover. If you have a comic shop near you its worth checking out just to see how nice the book is. Now Linda offers several premium extras that you can purchase and add to the boo. Color tip in plates for the chapter headers (very cool), a dust jacket (also cool), a fake library card and sleave from the comics fictional librarcy that you can put in the back of the book, and a little sculpted thing to clip onto the end of the books attatched bookmark. Each one is optional and costs a little extra. My housemate bought the book without any extras, but is considering getting the color plates and maybe the dust jacket.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I had a dream of a Premium Edition: It would be me adding a few pages here and there, then going back through the whole book, and in red text in the margins, adding Director's Commentary (Author's Commentary, but still) as if it were a special feature in a movie; Tell people why you used those setting elements, what inspired you, what thoughts you had, early playtest notes/disasters, how things changed, etc.<br><br>BOOK: Director's Cut.</br></br></blockquote>

                            The only premium edition I'd pay more for is the hardback version of something instead of the softback version. Or something like Andy is talking about. In fact I'd pay quite a bit more for that ... But then, I'm not a collector, but I do like to feel I'm getting the most value for my money.                        </div>

                            Speaking to Andy's idea, I wonder if it would be instructive or interesting to see a set of drafts that were snapshots of a game's text and mechanics as it developed?

I've seen sausage getting made. I want that day back.<br><br>But I like the idea. The revisions stuff is so true. As John reminded me a week or so ago, there was an old draft of Primetime Adventures that had rules for recovering from wounds.                        </br></br></div>

                            Yeah, maybe not just a file dump but a companion document that notes interesting evolutions with commentary.  <br><br>Wound recovery rules are essential!

                            Much more valuable comments I can apply practically. I continue to observe this thread for further insights. <br><br/>For personal projects, I don't keep old drafts. I just edit a single document, so the best I'd be able to do would be design commentary on the final document, to the best of my memory. I keep backups, of course, but I don't bother with actual versioning until I get to published versions. <br/><br/>Walkthrough demo/con adventures is a good idea. Not just samples, but actual guidelines for applying the rules to a sample adventure that can be used to demo the game.                        </br></div>
