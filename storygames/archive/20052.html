My takeaway from the discussion was that Alignment and Class(/Race) are the metrics by which D&amp;D as a system measures "good roleplaying" and XP by which it rewards the same. <br/><br/>I'd be interested in talking about how, as gamers and designers, you like to measure good roleplaying (if at all) and choose to reward that. What methods have you seen? What do you use? Is roleplaying a thing that should even be rewarded, or is it its own recompense?<br/><br/>At least in D&amp;D Alignment and Class act as proscribed styles of roleplaying. You're a dwarf? Here's a paragraph or two of how we expect Dwarves to act. You're Lawful? Here's how Lawful persons act. We were keen to make Alignment specifically attuned to promoting, for example, Lawful behaviour/roleplaying and giving XP out for, say, rescuing princesses. I guess I'm curious as to if good roleplaying and diegetic activity are well coupled by this reward, or whether it's all very trite and Pavlovian?<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443270/#Comment_443270" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T21:46:28+00:00" title="February 25, 2015  9:46PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2015 9:47PM by Rickard.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dog treats for anything that's not a physical task, a competition or boring in the first place, should be erased from any kind of game design thoughts what so ever.

(I submit that it was not, though it has since sometimes been repurposed to that end. Poorly.)<br/><br/>I don't like games that suggest that "Good roleplaying" should be rewarded, because "Good Roleplaying" is useless and vague as a criteria.  I like games that tell you exactly what sorts of behaviors to reward. <br/><br/>Alignment (And class, and race) fall down because at the end of the day, they are vague, and there are no real rules for rewarding people based on them, only punishing people who "break" the vague statutes.  So they end up being a sort of flogging punishment that the GM can use to try to beat players into line, rather than a reward. <br/><br/>OTOH, Rickard, I'm sure, will appear to discuss how ingame rewards for good roleplaying are a "bribe" and should not be used. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443272/#Comment_443272" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T22:02:55+00:00" title="February 25, 2015 10:02PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's two models I like.<br/><br/>One of them is the one you find in Tenra Bansho Zero, where players toss around the "<i>aiki</i> chits" as "applause". (Golden Sky Stories uses a similar system, and fans of PTA will recognize it as being very similar to fanmail.) It's cool, because there's a neat underlying philosophy here: when you're in harmony (the general meaning of "aiki") with the table, people respond positively to your actions, and react to that with a mechanical response.<br/><br/>Chuubo's Marvellous Wish-Granting Engine also uses this mechanism in the form of Emotional XP. It works really well, because it brings players together--also a mechanism I've observed in Golden Sky Stories. I don't find it to be manipulative or anything like a Skinner box, or even like Pavlov's experiment. Rather, it's a mechanical reflection of what's going on at the table: the players are appreciating one another.<br/><br/>It's only a bribe if you're pre-conditioned to see it as such. A quantum bribe, if you will.<br/><br/>The second method is something you could call "tracking": a mechanical device such as XP which follows the actions of a character along certain paths. One such example is the Milestones from Marvel Heroic, or the Quest Arcs from Chuubo's: as your character engages certain story elements which correspond to a particular arc, they advance in power or some other capacity. D&amp;D is, of course, a classic example of this, with the path being "looting treasures". Dungeon World makes it more apparent with its XP-earning end-of-session questions. Some of Burning Wheel's artha awards (persona for achieving a goal, for example) fall under this.<br/><br/>Tracking is all about mechanically reflecting the <i>character's</i> actions at the table. And you might notice the common thread there. Applause is oriented towards the player's attitude, and often comes from other players. Tracking is oriented towards the the character's actions, and comes from the game system (although it's typically adjudicated by the players).<br/><br/>Either way, it's a way to make abstract things concrete in some way. And I very much value that, because I'm the sort of person who likes to analyze characters and plots and to see how certain events change characters and move them forward. And in a weird way, neither of these techniques are completely rewards, even though they contain the concept of incentive. They're just acknowledgements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443274/#Comment_443274" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-25T22:37:21+00:00" title="February 25, 2015 10:37PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The key word here is Acknowledgement, not Rewards.

I get worried when we start talking about any sort of mechanics in terms of "need";  We don't "need" ANY mechanics.  But mechanics can improve things.  That's why we have... pretty much all mechanics. You don't "need" them, but they make your game better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443291/#Comment_443291" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T02:35:23+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:35AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like CarpeGuitarrem's thoughts here:<br/><br/>There's a difference between using XP (in whatever form) to encourage certain behaviour in the *players* (e.g. when you do something everyone finds funny, you get a +1 to your next roll) and using mechanical aids to track progress through the game-state.<br/><br/>For me, XP in D&amp;D falls into the latter category (I'm thinking particularly of XP-for-gold here - I shudder at the thought of "XP for good roleplaying" as a medieval torture method in terms of where it falls in the evolution of RPG technology). It has nothing to do with roleplaying whatsoever.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, it simply tracks how long you've survived (indirectly) and what you have managed to achieve (directly), which has to do with various combinations of smart play, low-risk vs. high-risk play, pure tenacity, and a good deal of luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443293/#Comment_443293" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T02:44:22+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  2:44AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 2:58AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Several thoughts:<br/><br/><b>1) "Good roleplay" XP in general</b>.  <br/><br/>Some people love fanmail and say it binds games together and encourages people to appreciate each other and communicate.<br/><br/>Some people hate fanmail and say it wracks their games with performance anxiety and turns roleplaying into a popularity contest.<br/><br/>I have seen "good roleplay XP" function exactly like fanmail, for good and for bad.<br/><br/><b>2) Alignments.</b>  As for "play your character according to defined parameters, get more XP", that's an excellent way to encourage broad-strokes consistency across measurable actions.  It clearly works.  The problem, I think, is that most of us don't define "good roleplay" as broad-strokes consistency across measurable actions, so the question of whether XP can encourage what we <i>really</i> want remains unanswered.<br/><br/><b>3) Types of formal rewards.</b>  I once tried awarding XP to players for making the fiction feel real via gripping performance or sensory description.  It didn't work at all, because anything we got caught up in also made us forget about handing out XP.  Handing it out after the session broke the feedback link, so that didn't function as an incentive.  What worked better was simply kicking each session off with a requirement for some sensory description.<br/><br/><b>4) If you want your game to reward good roleplaying</b>, I would say: define what that means, and then structure play so that doing that is the best way to get the players their game goals.  (Formal awards can be used or not as befits that structure.)  Of course this is easier said than done!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443294/#Comment_443294" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T03:03:39+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:03AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Dave.<br/><br/>(As far as your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> goes, my own attempt at a simple but far-reaching take is linked in the OP.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443295/#Comment_443295" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T03:20:10+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:20AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 3:48AM by AsIf.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back in my AD&amp;D days, my campaign featured a lot of deity stuff, they were very active in the world (shades of the "Thieves World" series) and everyone's standing with their deity - whether they had claimed a deity or not (didn't matter because this was actually about alignment) - was based on their alignment behavior.  I graphed this out in a way that was loosely explained in the DMG, and I've never heard of anyone else who actually sat down and did this: <br/><br/>I had an X/Y graph for each PC and after each session the Player and I would sit there and count up the "significant" things they had done, and then assign each deed an alignment.  I assigned a positive and negative value of absolute 1 to each of those actions, found the average in both G/E and L/C dimensions, averaged that with the X and Y coordinates of their previous position on the graph to determine their new position, and then connected the two dots with a line segment.

The diagram in the Wikipedia article about the overjustification effect is worth looking through and understand. Look at when a tangible reward, not related to the task other than being given because they did it, really makes a difference.<br/><br/>Cognitive Evaluation Theory focuses on how you can get intrinsic motivation from a task, when you express yourself as a person (autonomy) or master the task (competence). Both autonomy and competence are also supported by flow theory - a theory about how to achieve happiness. The major studies that lead up to that theory also says that tangible rewards can decrease the intrinsic motivation in favor of extrinsic motivation. That is, some people will start doing the task for the reward instead of for the fun of doing the task.<br/><br/>But all this is just about how you should NOT design a game. The first paragraph is instead about what ways you can go do design certain behavior. And it's hard not to fall into this trap to give mechanical rewards for tasks. I'm aware of it, and I <i>still</i> have a hard time not to involve those kinds of rewards, because it's so commonly used in game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443321/#Comment_443321" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T13:47:34+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  1:47PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 1:49PM by 2097.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco uses the two colors of dice to ensure a good mix of failures and successes. Less mercantile than Fate. I agree that it works well.<br/>I think the Fate points are less reward/consolation (even though that is part of their purpose) and more a sort of "economy model". I've had it collapse more times than it worked well, but that's their purpose I think.<br/><br/>And I don't put Fate points in the same category as GURPS 3's "for good roleplaying" points.<br/>It's more something you can "buy" and "sell" (as problematic as that is). I don't have any problems with the drama points in DramaSystem either (the bennies OTOH seem more iffy).<br/><br/>ETA:<br/>To answer more directly, I think running Fate kinda depends on people thinking playing out flaws can be cool. The transaction also fills the purpose of affordance; that the rules encourage you to do this, not just allow it, and that you can do it without all the problems of the anti-Taschenlampenfallenlasser culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443336/#Comment_443336" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T15:08:43+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:08PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really see Fiasco as relevant to this discussion at all, since to me the dice types feel completely arbitrary and mostly meaningless. <br/><br/>2097 - what is your feeling about "rewards" when they are collectively judged, rather than at the whim of one individual?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443341/#Comment_443341" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T15:28:52+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:28PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 3:29PM by 2097.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't really see Fiasco as relevant to this discussion at all, since to me the dice types feel completely arbitrary and mostly meaningless.</blockquote>\nIt was a reminder since I read Rickard as meaning that in Fiasco, people are failing for the sake of the fun of failing and I wanted to bring up that Fiasco does have the dice colors as a way to determine when to fail and when to succeed, and that Fate's compels filled a similar role.<br/>Like, if the GM compelled the player in the Shoggoth tunnel "you have an aspect of 'scaredy-cat'... how about dropping that flashlight now and running?", the group would surely feel different about it. Similarly, in Fiasco, if you're handed a "bad die" by the group, you know you've got their permission to mess up.<br/>Ironically, I've mentioned earlier that a few of my players in Fate would tend to buy off all compels.\n<blockquote>2097 - what is your feeling about "rewards" when they are collectively judged, rather than at the whim of one individual?</blockquote>\nJust as problematic. The bennies in DramaSystem come to mind, as do the awesomepoints in Old School Hack.<br/>In fact, the game that truly unsold me on this type of adjudication was a party game about constructing crazy news paper head lines where the winner each round was determined by voting, so collectively judged. Instead, games like Dixit and Balderdash solve the problem in a great way.<br/><br/>Rickard's aversion to "dog treats" has been well known for years, but I always assumed it was about the subjective adjudication (which I really dislike) and not about the conditioning aspect of it, which I dig.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443342/#Comment_443342" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T15:31:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:31PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Can I see the goblins from where I stand?" &lt;- I have no problems with this.<br/>"Did I describe the fight in a cool enough way to get the bonus?" &lt;- I do not like this<br/>Like it even less when there's competition involved (again looking at you, DramaSystem).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443343/#Comment_443343" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T15:34:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:34PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Did this Aspect influence my behavior in a meaningful way?" &lt;- I thought I would be against this, but I've had no problems with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443346/#Comment_443346" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T15:58:35+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  3:58PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Did this Aspect influence my behavior in a meaningful way?" &lt;- I thought I would be against this, but I've had no problems with it.&lt;/p&gt;</blockquote>\nSo...you DON'T actually have a problem with arbitrary decisions, you have a problem with certain KINDS of arbitrary decisions. <br/><br/>Also, doesn't Fiasco involve voting on dice types?

Though I think part of why dice in Fiasco felt so arbitrary was the fact that "Do you think that scene will have positive or negative effects for the character?" is basically disconnected from everything.  It doesn't even tie to how or what the character did in the scene, necessarily, it's strictly a vote on dramatic pacing.<br/><br/>Anyway, yeah, I think we should scratch the Fiasco discussion, because I don't really think it has anything to do with the original topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443357/#Comment_443357" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T16:56:31+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  4:56PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a game that tends to bring out and encourage roleplay of "bad" characteristics through its mechanics so I think that's relevant, as a contrast to games that specific use <i>rewards</i> for the same purpose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443358/#Comment_443358" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T17:11:23+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  5:11PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 5:12PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the right question for adjudicating dice in fiasco should be more like "what do you think could make the situation worse?" which again, is more a vote on dramatic pacing as Airk wrote, and even a vote on dramatic direction if you consider the question above.<br/><br/>Perhaps Fiasco may be considered again into the discussion but from a different point of view: Stop thinking on dice as currency and instead look at all the mechanics in the game that allow players to acknowledge each other's contributions by building the story over it, instead of blocking their input. Certain limits are imposed here and there (like with the dice), but most of the time, the flow of the game is attained by using other players contribution to make yours, which is a really nice form of acknowledgement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443359/#Comment_443359" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T17:13:18+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  5:13PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 5:24PM by 3Jane.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, CarpeGuitarrem mentioned all the games that I loved!

So, it's a thing of different tools for different players, but all revolves around acknowledgement, which is in turn used as fuel for inspiration and game flow. I can read people's emotions on the fly even in tense situations but my abilities doesn't work on everyone; some people unconsiously keep the same face and manners as a self-defense mechanism, so having a mechanic to help them communicate better surely helps. <br/><br/>Whenever I play with people who I can read easily or who are more openly honest about what they like or not, mechanical rewards get in the way of the fun and are easily taken as a recurrent joke. When I tried fate points into another game, players kept pushing the button even when they didn't wanted or needed the points, just because it had turned into an inside joke for us. I felt it ruined a bit some scenes, but I couldn't take it out from the game because players really enjoyed the joke.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443369/#Comment_443369" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-26T18:25:31+00:00" title="February 26, 2015  6:25PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2015 6:30PM by Rickard.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Fiasco uses the two colors of dice to ensure a good mix of failures and successes.

That creates a great arc and make the failures more meaningful.<br/><br/>The end, that's the last few scenes, the aftermath table and the epilogue.<br/>I'm mentioning the dice colors in this context because I think the Fate compels are meant to evoke a similar ebb and flow. Some scenes go bad for your character and the Fate points give you permission to mess up, to let the flashlight drop.\n<blockquote>The participants need, however, to buy into that premise.</blockquote>\nAnd Fiasco has a lot of great design elements to afford such buy in. The relationship-focused character design has many benefits, one of it is that you're almost from the start looking at your character from the outside rather from a deeply invested, immersed stance.<br/>In the middle, the spotlight mechanics afford some investment,<br/>and in the end the "This is Jane when she" third party style sentences create distance again for the denouement (and help you pump up the horror since you're not "Jane" anymore).<br/><br/>I believe this is part of the purpose of Fate points also, to afford the idea for players to have their characters do things the players believe are suboptimal. To overcome the "Don't go into the attic!"-reflex and help <em>create</em> or reinforce the buy-in.<br/>It's less "yay, I get a point to use later, that's gonna be a nice +2" and more "hey, player. It's ok for things to Go Bad now. It's part of the game.

I'm not versed in psychology but in advertising. What this roleplaying tool does (when you analize it RAW) is to validate the GM for manipulating players and/or validate group pressure over a single player. This tool has seen so much abuse that I understand why he despises it.<br/><br/>Of course, the other side of the same tool is that it's actually useful, when used perhaps more in accordance to the initial intention of the designers: to give shy people a chance to express their preferences for the playing agenda.

I think there is certainly a place for systems that work to stifle bad behavior or problem players, but I wouldn't want every system to tie the hands of good players in an effort to weed out the bad. To a certain extent these are social issues between the players and not the responsibility of game designers. If players use the mechanics as weapons against each other or as tools of manipulation, those are people I don't want to play with. If the only thing stopping Jim from being a jerk to me at the table is a rule in the book, there is a bigger issue than the system.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443403/#Comment_443403" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T04:00:11+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  4:00AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2015 4:29AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the observations from <a href="/forums/profile/3Jane%27s">@3Jane's</a> post, but I think that's just one side of the coin; some other players use fanmail as dictated by social pressures rather than play, which renders their feedback useless.  <br/><br/>I think there are some keys in the details:\n<blockquote>when they give the rewards to other participants, the action encourages them to verbalise what they liked about what those people did.</blockquote>This practice sounds like it'd greatly enhance the clarity of the feedback!  And I've never seen it happen before!  Every fanmail game I've played, one player has said something funny or clever or intense and another player has tossed them a token and roleplay has continued uninterrupted.  Zero "what did you like about that?" chat.  How did your group wind up doing this?<br/><br/>Brainstorm: a game could use different colors of fanmail tokens.  You throw different colors for different things.  For example, red is drawing us in with portrayal, black is pushing or turning the fiction in a direction that we're excited to explore, and white is making us laugh.<br/><br/>If these tokens can then be spent for anything, the rewards could match the achievements -- red goes toward character development, black adds GM opportunities, white lets you interject in scenes where you're absent, etc.  I already do something like this in my supervillain game -- it works fine, but the game isn't set up to focus on it, so no one wants to bother with picking out the right color bead to toss.  So we just go by role at the time of the award (villain/GM/other).  But if another game benefits from "what did you like about that?" chat, then maybe it'd be appropriate there.\n<blockquote>It also shows me who needs more spotlight and encouragement because I can see who has a stack and who hasn't.</blockquote>This just reminded me -- there's some fanmail game (PtA?) where players start out holding the tokens they can <i>give</i>.  The tokens they collect go in a separate pile.  So when you look around, you can not only see who'd <i>getting</i> love, but also who's <i>giving</i> love.  In my experience, the people who aren't getting excited enough by what's going on at the table to hand out tokens are the ones who might need extra GM attention.  Not character spotlight time per se, but some sort of opportunity to help set the tone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443404/#Comment_443404" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T04:01:13+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  4:01AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a>, that whole alignment-behavior progression chart (and deities having an opinion on it) makes alignment 1000 times cooler to me.

This was never seen by Players as a "reward" or as a "punishment", because it was a literal in-game consequence of their own in-game actions.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443406/#Comment_443406" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T04:22:55+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  4:22AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2015 4:30AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Deleted my objection to Rickard's rewards-hate, as I just noticed that <a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">@Bedrockbrendan</a> already <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/443401/#Comment_443401" rel="nofollow">said the same thing</a>.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443407/#Comment_443407" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T04:36:06+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  4:36AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Why are you so angry? </blockquote>\nFrustration, and some more things, but honestly: all those are just excuses.

I've obviously not experienced the same thing as other people did. My preferences might be also because with regards to social pressures, I think I prefer things to be out in the open instead of non-verbal cues such as sighs or who is listened to more attentively, because the latter simply make me uncomfortable and unwanted without knowing why and how I transgressed against the group rules. If the problems are out in the open, at least I can make an informed decision about what to change and whether to stay with the group or leave it.<br/><br/>Also, this touches on geek social fallacies. Not all groups are for everyone, not everyone is for all groups. And that's okay.\n<blockquote><blockquote>when they give the rewards to other participants, the action encourages them to verbalise what they liked about what those people did.</blockquote>This practice sounds like it'd greatly enhance the clarity of the feedback!  And I've never seen it happen before!  Every fanmail game I've played, one player has said something funny or clever or intense and another player has tossed them a token and roleplay has continued uninterrupted.  Zero "what did you like about that?" chat.  How did your group wind up doing this?</blockquote>\nI haven't played or read Primetime Adventures, but giving verbal feedback is required by the rules of Tenra Bansho Zero, Burning Wheel and Mouseguard. (I think it may also be the case for Chuubo's Emotional XP as well, but a) I don't remember, b) it's not as central game concept there anyway, so.)<br/><br/>In TBZ, which is the game I was referring above, you're supposed to specifically say what you're handing out the token for. That's partly because it's disallowed for several players to give a token for the same thing, and partly because the game rules explicitly recognise the value of feedback. The GM is supposed to kickstart the process by clearly setting an example at the start of the game (hopefully it'll make it easier for the shy/reserved people to follow an already set example; sometimes it's not enough to simply say "here are the game rules, do it" - people need to see that internal social rules of the group also allow expressing an opinion on the performance of others).<br/><br/>In BW and MG you hold a discussion at the end of the game, asking about each belief/instinct etc in particular and checking if they were fulfilled, voting for the MVP award and so on. And yeah, the MVP voting might turn into a popularity contest and it might turn out that the group doesn't appreciate your contribution as much as they should have. But my thinking is that they wouldn't have done it anyway but wouldn't have told you, and at least now you know and can act accordingly.\n<blockquote>This just reminded me -- there's some fanmail game (PtA?) where players start out holding the tokens they can <i>give</i>.  The tokens they collect go in a separate pile.  So when you look around, you can not only see who'd <i>getting</i> love, but also who's <i>giving</i> love.  In my experience, the people who aren't getting excited enough by what's going on at the table to hand out tokens are the ones who might need extra GM attention.  Not character spotlight time per se, but some sort of opportunity to help set the tone.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's a great idea! That's not part of TBZ - there's simply a central supply of the tokens - but I did notice another TBZ GM (hi Neil <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> hand out stacks of tokens to individual players for ease of access, or encourage the players to take them themselves. And then, indeed you can see who's engaged with other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443420/#Comment_443420" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T08:55:16+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  8:55AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks!

"Label it so we don't double up" is also a lot less judgmental than "justify your preference" -- kinda slips the evaluation in there very subtly.<br/><br/>What kinds of things did your players say when awarding tokens?

I'm used to being the weird one out, getting out, being alone and having to rebuild your social scene, on a big scale (I emigrated to another country to escape gender and religious discrimination, I also moved around the country several times for work related reasons). You could try making friends over things that aren't a part of your core identity. Have you got any Toastmasters clubs around you? This helps you get to know a lot of people, brush up on your public performance and organisation skills, and boosts your self esteem.\n<blockquote>"Label it so we don't double up" is also a lot less judgmental than "justify your preference" -- kinda slips the evaluation in there very subtly.</blockquote>\nOh, I never thought about it that way (as a justification). Thank you. I can see why people would be reluctant to say anything if they perceived it that way.\n<blockquote>What kinds of things did your players say when awarding tokens?  Did you have to nudge them at all, or did they pick up on useful explanations intuitively after your first demo?</blockquote>\nIt was a couple years ago so I won't be able to quote. It was stuff like "this description made me shiver!" (to the gm), "oh yeah! *fist bump*" (after an outrageous, entertaining action), "of course you'd do that, you're in love with her!" (when acting in character), but I'm sure some were more specific.<br/><br/>I ran a TBZ game (one-shot) three times.<br/>Group 1 consisted of experienced storygamers and game designers, mostly friends plus one random, on a con devoted to indie and storytelling games (Indiecon).<br/>Group 2 consisted of a half-storygamers-half-trads mix, all friends, at home<br/>Group 3 consisted of mostly trad (I'm guessing) randoms on a con where people usually run trad games (Conception).<br/><br/>I listed the groups/games in a descending order in terms of player engagement, innovation, feedback, openness to other players, trust towards the GM, knowledge of source material (Japanese culture, anime) and general "spark".<br/><br/>Storygamers, on average, picked up on things intuitively. They happily engaged in PvP (pregenerated characters were deliberately pointed at each other), gave feedback around the table, pushed their agendas. After the initial kickstart, tokens circulated around the table. They found the TBZ system had too much bookkeeping which was supposed to guide players towards what they'd do anyway. I think Hot War emerged as a better alternative.<br/><br/>Trad gamers were more concentrated on interacting with the GM, I had to pull them into the story, give them a quest, and generally they were passive about pushing their character agendas. It was harder to get them to hand out tokens - some caught on, some didn't. Some didn't push the system's buttons as much and therefore didn't get the rewards. Some had great fun anyway, some didn't (in the same group). Unfortunately, it's the failures that stay with you, and I'm still racking my brains as to how I could have done it better. Maybe it's not always possible in a con one-shot with strangers.<br/><br/>If a player already wanted to do drama and wasn't interested in BIG FIGHTS and mechanical conflicts, they found a lot of TBZ unnecessary. If a player wanted the resources for the BIG FIGHTS and to throw their weight around, TBZ would nicely guide them towards drama and encourage feedback. More than one game session was generally required for people to reliably catch up on the feedback loop. If a player simply expected to go for a ride and be entertained with the minimum interaction effort, essentially being a dead fish, TBZ had no bite.\n<blockquote><blockquote>In BW and MG you hold a discussion at the end of the game</blockquote>You've gotten "roleplay feedback" info from this?  I'm surprised.  I mean, yeah, one player gets a "good roleplay" award for Embodiment, but that's one unit of feedback per session.  The rest of the awards are for book-defined stuff or for Workhorse &amp; MVP, which my groups always judged by character achievements rather than by how the players played.</blockquote>\nOkay, we're going into the dictionary territory. That depends on what you mean by "roleplay". For me roleplay means filling your character's role, and encompasses more than just the player's thespian abilities. Therefore if someone pushed for their character's goals, this definitely counts for me as roleplaying, even if they didn't have the most convincing voice acting, best jokes, most convincing arguments or whatever. I'm happy if a player talks about their PC in third person and describes the result of their conversation ("She comes up to the guards and attempts to convince them to let her talk to the queen"), as long as they actively do stuff that's in their beliefs, put their characters at risk etc.<br/><br/>Also I have only ran BW as a GM, so I don't know what it's like from the player's perspective. (I'm one of those people with an instinct of "if you like something and nobody's doing it, do it yourself". I ran TBZ, BW, Chuubo's, but I only got the chance to play GSS, TBZ, and MG fairly recently).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443439/#Comment_443439" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T11:39:25+00:00" title="February 27, 2015 11:39AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>What kinds of things did your players say when awarding tokens?

More like - it helps people who like actively engaging and fiddling with the system/crunch to generate a cool story as a byproduct. It seems aimed at players who like to *game* and *emote* instead of just *storytelling* if that makes sense.<br/><br/>As for TBZ tokens and people who didn't need it. I think it encouraged people to explicitly signal and verbalise when they liked something and what they liked about it. Even when the players felt they didn't need it, I personally enjoyed the dynamic being more explicit. People didn't express dislike towards the tokens - rather, some didn't like the Fates (with the required upkeep) and some didn't like the combat resolution.\n<blockquote>I definitely see how pursuing beliefs counts as roleplaying, I just meant that if the <i>game</i> rewards you for that objectively, it doesn't function as inter-player feedback.

It's a chance to collaborate.<br/><br/>For me as the GM, when I see the player didn't hit on their beliefs, it's a sign that I'm not giving them enough spotlight, or overwhelming the game with my ideas instead of engaging the player flags - in which case I need to brainstorm more, or the player is turtling and not biting in which case I need to check whether they're actually enjoying the game system or would prefer to switch.<br/><br/>Then, I don't need this person to go out and tell me "I was bored", "I felt ignored", "I have no clue what my character would do" - their lack of Artha points tells me this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443445/#Comment_443445" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T14:55:17+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  2:55PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/> Sounds like a good example of "hitting the in-betweeners".

Though I'd love to meet the saintly playgroup that doesn't need a little prompting to live their character a bit more. <br/><br/>The tokenistic nature of the reward-acknowledgment is important here, I think.

I had a player in my group who was opposed to things like giving Bennies for good RP or giving RP XP awards because he was concerned about fairness and felt GMs could never really be fair here, and would always reward the more socially adept player. I also know people who object to them because they dislike the notion of your character advancing in his gun skills because he was charming on an occasion or because he was being true to his personality. <br/><br/>For the first objection I think that is something of a mindset issue. Me and the player in question debated the topic a lot on the point of fairness. I think a lot of it was shaped by our individual experiences in life. For me, I am fine with a human referee making judgment calls and striving for fairness, even if being 100% truly fair all the time is never going to happen. I also think it is wise to give points for effort here to encourage people who may be trying to role-play well, but just don't have the natural social skills of someone else at the table (because for me what matters most is the level of investment at the table). However my friend did make many good points for the opposing side. I just never felt "somewhere, someone will be unfairly evaluated" is a good reason for rejecting any attempt to be a fair arbiter of more subtle things in the game. <br/><br/>I am more sympathetic to the argument that good role-play shouldn't translate into things like XP or bennies, because there is no real connection between those two things in the setting. There is always a bit of handwaving in any XP and progression system, because real life is  a lot more complicated. But there is so much handwaving when you get better at attacking because you role played your gruff but sincere warrior at the tavern that one time. That said, I cut my teeth on 2E which had RP awards, and as long as their are fairly small, I don't mind them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443449/#Comment_443449" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-27T15:13:54+00:00" title="February 27, 2015  3:13PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only mainstream game advancement system that really ever made sense to me in a "You did it successfully, so there's a chance you get better at it" is the one in Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>The thing is, I do understand <i>some</i> fear of unfairness when there's this much opinion involved.<br/><br/>I guess it's the level of the reaction that surprises me a bit.

Present instead situations where they <i>can</i> act out in character and see if they think it's fun in the first place. Why do you really feel the need to bribe them if they don't want to do it?<br/><br/>The other one of my two biggest concerns is that other players can see through the tangible reward and see it for what it really is: acknowledgment for their effort. But if they don't care about the mechanical reward, why even have it in the first place? Just present more situations for them, or consequences of their actions, so they can act out in character even more. That's a reward <i>related to the task</i>, and it presents new situations that is solved by doing what they like: act out in character.<br/><br/>To me, design-through-rewards is a combination of not knowing how tangible rewards work and laziness. For the latter, instead of designing a structure of play that enforces a type of behavior (example: situations where they can act out in character), you end up with giving out these mechanical rewards whenever the players' behavior is good.<br/><br/>Design-through-rewards is easy. It's just "+1 XP if you break your oath". It conveys, in a clear way, what the players are supposed to do. Compare this to describe how the game master should create situations that goes against the character's oath. But to be able to do that, you need to attract the right audience that would <i>enjoy </i>playing characters that will break their oaths and, to do that, you need the right pitch for the game. That's a lot of work. Assuming that people will think the task becomes fun if you dress it up in a tangible reward like this is also lack of knowledge about how these kinds of rewards work.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/>- some players will only do it for the reward.<br/>- rewards should be related to the task. XP for "good roleplay" is not.<br/>- create instead a structure of play that enforces one type of behavior<br/>- BUT you need people that want to do it in the first place<br/>- BECAUSE I personally don't see the point in making players do something they don't think is fun in itself.<br/><br/>I can totally understand why people think in terms of design-through-rewards, because it's so wide spread in all kinds of games. Just take the loot system in any CRPG which are all based on the research of operant conditioning. How loot drop can sometimes wield a really useful item so killing the rats doesn't feel a waste of time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443479/#Comment_443479" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T18:29:29+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  6:29PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2015 6:31PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard, although I disagree with much of the broad-strokes anti-reward stuff you said earlier, I do agree with most of your last post.  Generic rewards totally unrelated to the behavior they're rewarding, or "rewards" that do nothing but acknowledge what's already happened -- these underwhelm me too.  And mechanical rewards <i>instead</i> of a proper structure of play that inspires and supports the desired behavior is just awful.<br/><br/>I guess it depends on how we use the term "reward", but <i>some</i> usages include all sorts of feedback and consequence, not just appreciation tokens or character improvement points.  The way horrific encounters drive down character Sanity scores has been described as the "reward system" of Cthulhu play, for example.  In one sense, losing Sanity represents a bad thing that happened to you, but in another sense, losing Sanity removes barriers to how crazily you're allowed to react to the horror.  Many players prefer such dynamic <i>constraints</i>, evolving in some relation to play, over simply <i>deciding</i> how much the horror is impacting their character.  In that respect, we can view a <i>good</i> reward system as one that keeps our supporting/inspirational structure fresh!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla" title="Sodzilla"><img alt="Sodzilla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla">Sodzilla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443480/#Comment_443480" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T18:34:08+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  6:34PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2015 6:34PM by Sodzilla.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just out of curiosity, how do you folks feel about the "Banners" variant from 1st Quest, where you get XP by spotlighting someone else's issue?<br/><br/>While I can still see how it could get messed up (because some people would still choose to give more spotlight to the more dramatic/popular player), I think having a mechanic that rewards helping someone else have fun avoids some of the pitfalls mentioned.<br/><br/>(Also, out of curiosity, does anyone know where I could find a copy of 1st Quest?

Like I said before, tangible rewards works - according to several scientific studies - only if it's a competition, physical activity, or a boring task. In other cases they do nothing or can decrease the intrinsic motivation for doing the actual task (seeing through what the reward does, or doing the task only because of the reward).<br/><br/>Rewards are also a subcategory to feedback, and feedback is a must to create an interaction. An interaction consist of two or more components that exchanges information. That information is feedback of each others' actions. Rewards I like are those that comes as natural responses to the players' action. Throwing in a treat is not.<br/><br/>The way XP works in D&amp;D is that you use mechanical things to get mechanical rewards. (Gygaxian D&amp;D is, <i>to me</i>, also a competition with the game master as an adversary). I have nothing against that. It's just when the feedback - in this case mechanical reward for doing something creative (like expressing yourself) - doesn't have anything to do with the actual task, that I object.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443485/#Comment_443485" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T20:18:34+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  8:18PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In that vein, I'm curious how you'd view the fan points and story points in my game Within My Clutches.

If you receive them while GMing or NPCing, they're Story points.<br/><br/>Every player has a secret Master Plan that they don't have opportunities to show in the normal flow of play.  <br/><br/>When you get enough Fan points, you get a Master Plan scene for <i>your</i> character.<br/><br/>When you get enough Story points, you get to set up a Master Plan scene for <i>another player's</i> character, imposing your own constraints about whether it progresses or derails or what.<br/><br/>The idea is that the reward suits the accomplishment:<br/>- If everyone is digging your character, you win the opportunity to show more of them.  <br/>- If everyone is digging your story-making, you win an opportunity to direct the spotlight more and set up more situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443486/#Comment_443486" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-28T20:18:39+00:00" title="February 28, 2015  8:18PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2015 8:21PM by AsIf.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>What would you say if I rewarded players for making interesting characters with lots of kicks (that drew them into role playing) rather than rewarding the roleplaying itself?</blockquote>Huh!  Well, if you actually <i>knew</i> what character features would play well in game, then I think that would be great!  I don't trust my own clairvoyance enough to do that, though...</blockquote>I feel like Mike may be suggesting something similar to what I came up with for DayTrippers, which supports Player-based kick-play without requiring clairvoyance.  There are three parts to this subsystem, here's how it works:<br/><br/>(1) <i>"Progressive Character Generation"</i> (allowing Players to spend character development points during play, not just during pre-play), (2) <i>"LifeShaping Events"</i> (personality-influencing events from the past which Players may create at any time, not just during pre-play) and (3) <i>"Character Development Scenes"</i> (a flashback scene showing us how you learned karate, for instance - perhaps we never knew your character knew karate - which can be used to buy yourself karate skill and place its acquisition in your character's past).<br/><br/>You don't get XP for buying yourself a skill.  But there is an XP reward if the Player makes a LifeShaper that causes <i>problems</i> for their character (such as "chemical dependence" or "wanted by police" etc).  Then there's also an XP reward if the Player makes use of a LifeShaper or CharDev scene to solve a <i>current</i> problem (i.e. a problem in the current session/scene).  This is not a reward for "roleplay" per se, rather it is a reward for making your imagined past actions meaningful in terms of today's story.<br/><br/>Remember Kwai Chang Caine's flashback scenes in every episode of "Kung Fu"?  <br/>That's kinda what I'm shooting for here.<br/><br/>I'm curious what y'all think of this approach.

If a person is uninterested in story generation, rather than actively opposed to it, they're not being tricked or forced into anything.<br/><br/>There's also one more benefit of tying story and system together that hasn't been covered above. It solves the problem of playing with people of mixed preferences.<br/><br/>Here's the problem:\n<ul>\n<li>in a game that requires system mastery and sacrificing some character-expressing options for the greater good of the party (this is my impression of Pathfinder), story-oriented people are going to feel restricted.<br/></li><li>in a game that gives you great freedom in creating a story (this is my impression of  Fiasco), system-oriented people are going to feel bored, or without the ability to meaningfully influence the events.<br/></li></ul>\nHowever, in a game with a loop of system incentives for generating story:\n<ul>\n<li>story=&gt;system part of the loop means that story-oriented players will generate valuable system resources for the system-oriented people to use (even though story-oriented players themselves don't care or need those resources, like my story-gamers didn't need TBZ tokens),<br/></li><li>and system=&gt;story part of the loop means that system-oriented players will generate a story for the story-oriented players to engage with (even though system-oriented players themselves don't care that much for the drama).<br/></li></ul>\nSuch a game would create a happy ecosystem, where both sides generate something the other side needs (almost like trees generate oxygen for mammals, mammals generate carbon dioxide for trees). You can view that as trickery, or you can view that as cooperation without having to sacrifice some of your fun for others' fun.\n<blockquote>Great points.  "Good roleplay points" needn't be bestowed upon one player by others to reflect their judgment; they can also be earned directly by one's own actions, for everyone else's edification.  Learn how to play from those who are racking up the Artha; see the Artha-poor and lend a helping hand.  (The latter's never happened in my BW play, but the former was definitely key to my learning curve.)</blockquote>\nSorry to hear that in your experience people didn't help the "poor performers".

If you ever get a game where people dish out points to someone to keep them get moving, then I feel the "encouragement" in those points will diminish. It has happened in some of these games I played, like <b>Psychodrame</b> or <b>Shab-al-Hiri Roach,</b> where shy or uninspired players got points just because they had so little points.<br/><br/>I would myself create a structure for scene framing where each participant must show off the character in some way, probably through conflicts, and also require to involve other characters in their scenes. Each character can have one or more relations to each other to make it easier to involve them. The relations could also be the backdrop to what will happen in the scene, as well as a basic situation or problem.<br/><br/>If you really want to have points, lets the relations grow stronger for each involvement in the scenes. When one relation (or the sum of them) got enough points, it will explode and present the spotlight moment (if you really need one). When the session is over, discuss why some characters got the least points and make sure to create new relations; or have other participants spend some of their points to create new ones. It's possible that the total sum of the points are shared by all characters and the ones with the most points must "give back" some points by buying or changing the other characters new relations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443662/#Comment_443662" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T15:11:39+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  3:11PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey now\u2014I don't recall anyone ending up especially Artha-poor in our BW game!

RP rewards handed out by a GM are particularly bad in this case, I think: they don't seem to serve any purpose at all, and don't feed back into the game in any way.<br/><br/>Fanmail seems to work best *after the fact*: you play a game with fanmail, and then you get used to the social reinforcing behaviour, so you start doing it even when the points aren't there any more. That feels great.<br/><br/>I agree with Rickard about some of the research around rewarding behaviour (which is in itself fun).<br/><br/>However, I have had great experiences with games which reward specific game actions, like Keys (in TSoY/Lady Blackbird), escalation in Dogs in the Vineyard, and similar devices.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how those two things line up, but it's possible that we just haven't figured it out yet (the science in this field is still developing, it's very new!).<br/><br/>For instance, I suspect it's possible that things like "point rewards" are very effective when we're dealing with a task we enjoy/want, but don't do (because of some limiting factors: shyness, limited time, limited willpower, forgetfulness, etc). Think of marketing techniques, social pressure, having a coach or buddy cheer you on at the gym, "rewards points" on shopping cards, and so forth. There's no question those thing *work* at some level.<br/><br/>The pacing, acknowledgement, and tracking elements of many game rewards are very key, too, I think - their function as a reward is sometimes just one aspect of the role they play in that game's design.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443695/#Comment_443695" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T21:45:41+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  9:45PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm not sure how those two things line up,</blockquote>\nBut I feel the same way.

What game designers need to realize is other kinds of acknowledgments not related to <b>mechanical </b>rewards; feedback related to the task; structures that makes people (game master or player) listen to, and use other contributions in their contributions.\n<blockquote>However, I have had great experiences with games which reward specific game actions, like Keys (in TSoY/Lady Blackbird), escalation in Dogs in the Vineyard, and similar devices.</blockquote>\nDon't mix up <i>mechanical </i>rewards with other kinds of feedback. The escalation mechanic is an example of what I'm talking about when I talk about gameplay or structure of play. It's a mechanic that leads to something else, where the sum of all mechanics interacting will create a certain outcome (in my interpretation for this specific example: dogs being assholes).\n<blockquote>Think of marketing techniques, social pressure, having a coach or buddy cheer you on at the gym, "rewards points" on shopping cards, and so forth.

Few actual players are complete stereotypes with <i>zero</i> interest in story (or system, or whatever), and interests wax and wane over time, and a system which survives variations in mood and attendance with a strong symbiotic loop is useful.  And, even if two players <i>do</i> have complete disinterest in each other's play, there can still be social or other reasons to wind up at the same table, so taking turns with the fun is at least equitable.</blockquote>\nYeah, if we were all living in a perfect world where we were running games for clones of ourselves, then we wouldn't need these kinds of things, but we're not;  "Gamifying" RP can get people who really want a "game" to engage with...to engage with RP.  And have fun doing it.<br/><br/>It's also useful to build the reverse loop so that people who don't really have any interest in the mechanical side still contribute to it.  In this way, all parties are served.<br/><br/>Also, I tend to agree with Bedrockbrendan - I think psychology is one of those spaces where it's really dangerous to extend the findings of a study in any area that looks/seems like it's the same thing;  Its very easy to discover that it's not the same and therefore everything you were looking at is wrong.<br/><br/>After all, it's important to remember that these are GAMES, and games mean that people expect to follow rules to do things and get results.   You're not "artificially" adding something to that by giving people something they can do that gets results.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443805/#Comment_443805" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T07:37:03+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  7:37AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke at RopeCon last year said "You can't gamify a game", don't know if true or not.

Tons of people like football and tons of people like basketball and virtually nobody likes "get the ball across the field" -- they want "more game" than just that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as you can tell from Rickard's last response, "add more game" is a hot-button phrase to some people, who will get visions of skinner boxes and stop reading the actual content of your post when they see it.<br/><br/>I've heard "more game" used to mean:<br/>- more rules<br/>- more formalized procedures<br/>- more strategy<br/>- more mental demands (memory, odds calculation, quickly synthesizing vast info, etc.)<br/>- more physical components (tokens, counters, meeples, action cards, etc.)<br/><br/>So you'd probably do better with "more traction", "more constraint", "more system", "more crunch", "more designed play" or something else for discussion purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443936/#Comment_443936" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-11T22:13:25+00:00" title="March 11, 2015 10:13PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts.
