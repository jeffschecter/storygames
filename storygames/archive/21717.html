The journey is half of the adventure.<br/><br/>The problem is that D&amp;D doesn't do a particularly good job of making that exploration interesting. There aren't many choices to make in modern editions when these tasks arise. Make a [skill] check. Roll high, you're good. Roll low, you're not so good.

Still well within the toolkit of standard D&amp;D, just zoom in a bit more on the things that interest you?<br/><br/>So stuff like: take the reasonable route, or the riskier shortcut (more difficult, but same check gets you further along the way)? Fail and expend resources: maybe you get hurt, maybe you watch your sword clatter down the cliff. Partway through, reassess your odds: at this rate, will you make it, or would it be wiser to take double back and take another route?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475053/#Comment_475053" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-27T21:06:07+00:00" title="June 27, 2018  9:06PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that the way to do it is the same way you make all mundane tasks interesting - you focus on the beauty in the situation, and the emotions it evokes in the characters and the players both. <br/>That and the narrative significance of the tasks involved.

Like, details that no one could notice until it's too late. You will tell the players about them only if they ask about them, if their characters look or are near enough to notice, etc. You can also give one of them out on really good rolls if things go that way, but try not to. The idea is that this whole thing should be interactive.<br/><br/>These things could be the slippery moss growing on what looks like an otherwise firm climbable surface. A crack on the ceiling of that room you're about to cross. The faint glowing mushrooms that seem to go brighter as you approach. Players will only get this info and it would be up to them to decide if it means anything or not. If it your prep it means there's a hazard, spring the trap when they don't take precautions, ask for a saving roll if these are not enough. Have them cross these things safely, no rolls required, if they play it right.<br/><br/>These details can also lead to opportunities like recovering one resource, finding a shortcut, learning lore from the place, etc. Or you can just put some things to get them paranoid <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><b>1-3 Things that can be picked up and/or used for something.</b> Like cover, or to store or hide things, to create a hazard against enemies. A thick layer of dust. Pebbles or dryed leaves that make noise when stepped upon. Flammable things, shallow water, places to hide and ambush. Furniture in a house or a bar, or even a dungeon. Statues that can be pushed over. Things that make thick smoke when burnt or have a terrible smell. <br/><br/>You better make these found on plain sight, at least most of them. Put these among the things to be noticed only when it makes sense. Enemies could also use these against the PCs!<br/><br/><br/>Also, whenever you describe a place, think of an emotion and let it fill the place. Hatred places will show signs of violence, past or possible. Sadness can instill a forest, specially in certain hours of the day, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475058/#Comment_475058" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-28T05:34:28+00:00" title="June 28, 2018  5:34AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what we do is to focus on the lack of clarity. Like, when they have a cleric willing to expend slots, water is no problem so we skip past that with one sentence. When they have <i>lesser restoration</i>, hygenie and disease is less scary. When they have a ranger in their favored terrain, we skip the nav roll. Usually they haven't covered all the bases. Encumbrance has been a major focus in this campaign, in a good way (after a while, it became more "hmm, what do I carry and what do I leave?" than "aaargh, I can't grok this stupid encumbrance system"). If Jen, their kurbits-painted horse, dies, they're in trouble since the horse carries so much.<br/><br/>When there is a lack of clarity of outcome, emotional engagement will follow. Last session a PC caught serious illness and the exhaustion levels were racking up. So every morning, the disease saving throw was the focus of the day. Zooming through all the navigation and skeleton bashing with the minimum of engagement to resolve those things, then when it's time for the disease save, everyone goes quiet, chips in their insp, cheers, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" title="Vivificient"><img alt="Vivificient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/869/nJT73EZCYKXZO.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vivificient">Vivificient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475059/#Comment_475059" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-28T06:01:35+00:00" title="June 28, 2018  6:01AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>play the video game Hunter in Darkness.</blockquote>\nThanks for pointing to this.
