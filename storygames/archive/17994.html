So yeah, your character may be an adventurer or a recenlty created vampire but, what's your objective in the game? Right now i'm looking for a list of questions or at least a nice random table to help players create their own objectives/motivations. So far:<br/><br/>-I like the question "What do you want your story to be about?" (though I can hardly remember from which game I picked it up)<br/>-Relationship trees. I love relationship trees. I'm a tree hugger.<br/>-I like the idea of an event marking the character's life, like in DRYH, and turning it upside down. Getting back your life is always a nice motivation.<br/>-At least the main guidelines of the setting should precede character creation, to give players some ideas.<br/><br/>Yet so far some of my players still get the blank page syndrome when they need to create their character's objective. What kind of tricks you use or want to try?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406596/#Comment_406596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-19T08:11:53+00:00" title="February 19, 2013  8:11AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two biggest sources I see for hesitation are:<br/>-No idea what the setting is, or what the possibilities are, and<br/>-Fear that the decision now will impact everything later (and make it suck)<br/><br/>So I address those in reverse order:<br/>"This is just a baseline, and it can change later if you get a better feel for things and how they fit together."<br/>and then<br/>"Think about the cool book you just read, or comic super-hero you were talking about, or movie you just watched.

We couldn't even bring the story to an end or at least, an interesting cliffhanger. How does that work in AW?

Is feels like for people that just play to find out what happens, picking up an objective for their character from the beggining is kinda hard. Players love challenges, but it's like they also love them to be unexpected, and some players may feel this takes away some of the fun from it.<br/><br/>So a random objective creation seems like a nice in-between choice for players that can't come up with an objective on their own. At least, I'm planning to offer this as a choice, not as a requirement for character creation.<br/><br/>Rickard, taking note of that; as a question it would be stated after presenting the basic setting as "This is the world.

You find out what the character does, how they survive (of course in the apocalypse there's always shortages so it makes for an easy list of things to consider) who they deal with regularly, what causes them problems.  You mindfully ask questions looking for things they want and need to do, you have a conversation to find out what makes them tick.

If not, then there's the questions and then the fishing trough the game. I'm trying this because most of the times it's not like you need a story for every player; there are players eager to follow and push on to another player's story without stealing all the spotlight. Actually I use to play like this myself, I kinda enjoy more the story when it isn't about my character, but when I can use my character to contribute to it.<br/><br/>It also helps a lot to have players focus on a specific situation, see their reactions and take note of what makes them tick about it, so you can use that later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406876/#Comment_406876" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T16:50:31+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  4:50PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2013 4:54PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think coming up with cool goals for a character is not that hard, and a really fun thing to do. "How do you wish the world was different?" "What would need to happen for that to be the case?" Or from the other side, "What's the most terrible or frightening thing that could happen to this community?" "What kind of person or threat would have the power to make that happen?"<br/><br/>Simple, cliche goals work great. "I need to rescue/find my lost lover." "I need to find a way to get back home." "I need to save my family from the impending disaster."<br/><br/>Ask them about a favourite book or movie, and draw some basic character goals from that. Adapting them to the current game concept/system/setting will make it seem much more original than you might think! (Lord of the Rings: "Okay, I just inherited this weird artifact of power, and I need to destroy it before the bad guys get their hands on it." But you're using a game which doesn't give you "hobbit" as a character choice, so you get: "Also, I'm courtier with ties to the criminal underworld." No way this is going to look like Lords of the Rings anymore!)<br/><br/>However, given players who are really not sure what to do with a blank slate, here is a thing you can do:<br/><br/>Lay out a few interesting or grabby details of the world/setting/situation. Then point at them and ask them how it affects their character. What opportunities does their character see? What kind of trouble does this cause them?<br/><br/>* "The head of a powerful corporation in charge of selling mechanical slaves has just died under mysterious circumstances. What's your relationship to this corporation?" <br/><br/><i>"I'm a mid-level employee secretly wishing to overthrow the corporation. I see this as my chance to make it to the top, so I can change the nature of this whole organization to something more wholesome."</i><br/><br/><i>"I'm the assassin who just offed the head of the corporation. Now I need to get out before their extensive security forces flay me alive!"</i><br/><br/>* "A mysterious ship just crashed on the shores of your island. It's packed with silver that is supposed to be cursed, and there are weird, long scraping marks along its hull. There's no one on board."<br/><br/><i>"I'm the local warlord. I need to get that silver under control before the members of the rebellion get their hands on it and manages to buy some weapons, which would allow them to put up some serious resistance to my war band."</i><br/><br/><i>"I'm a local convict. I need to escape from my cell and steal some of that treasure before someone can get to it and take inventory!"</i><br/><br/>And so on.
