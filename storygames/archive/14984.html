(There are occasional other points in the game that invoke AUF obligatorily, but that is beside the point just now.) There aren't any RPGs I can think of that have <em>zero</em> judgement-call rules, although there are a few that have only a very small amount. There are some very 'light' games that rely mostly on judgement-call rules, and I happen to find that pattern very effective for short-form gaming.</p>\n<p>Again using AW as an example, we have the "at the start of session" moves from several of the playbooks. You don't get to make decisions about when these occur - they happen exactly when the circumstances calling for them are met.

That "when" comes with a huge spectrum of ambiguity from "totally clear" to "totally ambiguous", as your examples illustrate.  In many games, when to use a rule is only ambiguous (i.e., requires a judgment call) due to poor presentation of the procedures.  In RPGs, this is often true: perhaps what "roll to attack" really means is "once you get within range, roll to attack".<br/><br/>Of course, that's not the whole story.  Any RPG procedure whose use stems from a particular fictional situation begs the question, "Okay, does <i>right now</i> count as that situation or not?"  I'm not talking about "Roll when your Humanity hits 0"; though that <i>represents</i> a particular fictional situation, the rule is invoked by a formal game quantity.  I'm talking about procedures you use when <i>your character is outnumbered</i> or <i>your character is agitated</i>, etc.  Some such situations manage to avoid judgment calls and ambiguity: either you're outnumbered or you aren't.  But other situations are simply ambiguous: how agitated counts as agitated?<br/><br/>So, if you want to <b>attach rules use to particular fictional states</b>, and any of those particular fictional states <b>might ever be ambiguous</b>, then you can't have a game free of judgment calls on which procedures to use when.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, not knowing which procedure to use when is a sign of a shitty game.  So attaching mechanics to ambiguous imaginings is a risky proposition.  Our hobby shows that it can be done!  But I'd be inclined to avoid that hurdle if I could.  How to avoid it?<br/><br/>- <b>Ignore ambiguity.</b>  Let players resolve ambiguous stuff by just talking.  Avoid mechanics until the players get to the next concrete thing that you, the game designer, care about.  Provide a framework and logic for play that enables them to in fact get to that concrete thing by just talking.<br/><br/>- <b>Destroy ambiguity.</b><br/> - - put a point value on any and all fictional elements as they're introduced<br/> - - restrict players from introducing content outside of defined parameters<br/><br/>- <b>Avoid rules.</b>  Provide rules to help players navigate the social dimension of the activity (basically, collectively inventing and communicating something they can all enjoy), then leave the fiction itself alone.<br/><br/>Other games' goals necessitate ambiguity, and some of them try to bridge the procedural gap with lots of <b>guidance</b>.  Perspective, attitude, orientation, rules of thumb, advice, examples -- these are an effort to help the players to quickly determine, "Yeah, this character is worked up enough to impede his performance on fine motor tasks, so we should roll Agitation now."<br/><br/>I think many good RPGs do a little of all of the above, to <i>minimize</i> the amount of procedural ambiguity in play, without going so far as to make <i>sure</i> it <i>never</i> happens.  For example:<br/><br/>- cull rules that are ambiguous and non-vital<br/>- list game-mechanical ratings of fictional elements expected to be most important<br/>- outlaw known problem content (no teleporters!)<br/>- teach players how to resolve stuff themselves<br/>- provide principles and media metaphors to guide arbitration<br/><br/>Whether the end results look like shitty games or not seems to depend on whether the players bring the skills to make the judgment calls easy, and/or the attitudes to make the judgment calls fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340668/#Comment_340668" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T16:59:20+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  4:59PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Why would you want to attach rules to particular fictional states?" is a related question.

Turning rulings into rules, swapping ideas for new rules (like classes or custom dungeon details), etc. puts the ruleset in the realm of being more of a toolbox for a variety of play situations, rather something more sharply-focused.<br/><br/>- in a game like, I dunno, My Life With Master, there are definitely judgment-call rules (when to award the sincerity die, the intimacy die, etc.), but the structure of the game is codified strongly by the various formulae: when stat x is greater than stat y, or when stat z reaches 0, event A happens. <br/><br/>In LL and games like it, there's a sort of style that comes up where GMs and players are encouraged to adjust, tweak, and change things on the spot, which in turn encourages them to do so on their own and develop a little culture of doing so. It's Metallica mix tapes all over again. <br/><br/>In MLWM and other games with more explicit structure in play, there's sort of an "Am I getting this right?" feeling that can develop in play - I consider this potentially anxious-making scenario the price of unlocking higher levels of play-experience consistency. <br/><br/>At the same time, it's not at all difficult to rely upon judgment-call rules (if applied in narrow circumstances) to create a particular play experience, or aspect of the experience. In Kagematsu, for example, a great deal of the game involves the Kagematsu player deciding whether a given act by a Woman player inspires love or pity. Given that, tactically, the Kagematsu player is best served (I think) by handing out lots of love instead of pity, it creates an interesting element of trust: will Kage-san uphold consistent standards of feminine propriety, or will he be understanding, tolerant, and gentle, his heart open to all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340686/#Comment_340686" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T22:10:02+00:00" title="August 26, 2011 10:10PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>So, if you want to<b>attach rules use to particular fictional states</b>, and any of those particular fictional states<b>might ever be ambiguous</b>, then you can't have a game free of judgment calls on which procedures to use when.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, not knowing which procedure to use when is a sign of a shitty game.</blockquote>\nGreat points!

And if it's unclear, there's greater incentive for the gaming group to ditch rules in favor of roleplay. (Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, assuming no one in the group invested heavily in social skills under the impression they would be useful.)<br/><br/>At the same time, there are also substantive characteristics of the rules  themselves to consider, as in when are players likely to submit to the rules? Elements like tactical choices, a focus on creating an interesting process of conflict, and emphasis on making the outcome interesting win or lose, or even redefining win and lose altogether, make it more likely for players to subject their player characters to the rules. While these issues aren't strictly about when to use the rules, they do have a lot to do with whether the players are like to use the rules, which is a related issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340705/#Comment_340705" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-27T09:43:30+00:00" title="August 27, 2011  9:43AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rules that aren't fun or that are too complex seem to be the most likely to be ignored.

There are lots of different types of judgment calls in different types of games, but I don't think whether or not something involves judgment is the actual distinction that's interesting. In chess, for example, whether to move your knight or your rook is a "judgment call" based on what you think the best strategy for victory would be. In <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, whether or not a character can use his Crack Shot trait is a decision that's based off of interpreting the fiction, and involves a form of "judgment", but there's rarely much dispute over whether it can be used or not in the specific instance of a raise or see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340717/#Comment_340717" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-27T12:07:49+00:00" title="August 27, 2011 12:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Er, Dan, we're not talking about <i>any</i> judgment calls, we're talking about <i>rule-use</i> judgment calls.

The rule for bringing it in is something along the lines of "when you concretely bring the trait into the fiction". They're definitely dependent on interpreting the fiction. There's no specific "crack shot rule" in the book. Whether or not a player's Crack Shot trait can be used is almost certainly a "judgment call" as this thread defines it, but it rarely has any of the negative connotations that spring to my mind when I hear the phrase "judgment call". In my mind, it's in a completely different category than a "do what's good for the story" kind of judgment-based rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor" title="GregPogor"><img alt="GregPogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_e5387V2_bKU/TVEgYJ8ZWtI/AAAAAAAAAcw/CFb4Akfg5SE/avatar_storygame_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor">GregPogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340742/#Comment_340742" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-28T03:37:05+00:00" title="August 28, 2011  3:37AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only game I know of that formalize precisely how and when the rules occur is Apocalypse World : rules are defined by Moves (eg. Seduce or Manipulate Someone), which come in play when a) the player explicitely announce their character is doing such a move, provided they also describe what they're doing (<i>"I try to manipulate him" "Cool, what do you do?"</i>) or b) the character does something that's described as a Move (<i>"I tell him \u201cI'm pretty sure a big guy like you isn't affraid of a small fry like him. Why don't you go deck him?\u201c \u201cCool, you're trying to manipulate him?"</i>).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the only moment you roll the dice in AW.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanically, Moves define moments in the shared narrative when the outcome isn't automatic. You roll the dice to see how much things go in your character's way. Moves are defined like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>When you try to <b>seduce or manipulate</b> someone, roll+hot. On a hit, they ask you to promise something first, and they do it if you promise. On a 10+, whether you keep your pthey need some concrete assurance right now.  concrete assurance right now. </i><br/>\n<br/>\nMoves make some things interesting by providing suspense to the situation: the outcome isn't sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoves conditions and results are pretty concrete. They are explicit things, actions that you can see from the outside. It's never "when you fall in love" or "when you feel moody", but things like "you try to take something by force" or "read a charged situation". Also, Moves are for the players. As a player, it's up to you to push the narrative in a precise situation if you want to make a move.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat tends to reduce judgement calls to a minimum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340793/#Comment_340793" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-28T23:06:17+00:00" title="August 28, 2011 11:06PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite><br><b>Bad Santa</b>: The whole D&amp;D 3.5 social system not affecting players generally has a lot more to do with player agency and division of power between the players and GM than the quality of the rules.

It doesn't seem to really count as concrete and verifiable in any <i>game</i> sense.<br/><br/>Which is why I started considering whether these things were really games at all.<br/><br/>OTOH, your prior post did get me thinking about the kinds of goals that players actually give themselves. Those are mostly considered social level goals. Like, consider "How does one "win" a party?"<br/><br/>I suppose by getting invited to the next one, right?<br/><br/>That's the level of player goal I was tthinking of after your post, and that's really very tricky to hash out.<br/><br/>Now, getting back to the original question, if we stop thinking of RPGs as proper games, when and where to apply rules ( or, instead of "rules, we can think of them as mini games surrounded by the amorphous blob of the total activity) becmes a different animal to consider, as do questions like who is applying them/initiating them and why they're doing that at all.<br/><br/>Jeez, I think I just made that clear as mud, didn't I?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341206/#Comment_341206" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T09:23:49+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  9:23AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 12:26PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I completely agree: winning a typical RPG is like winning a party.  There are definitely things you want to achieve, but you can't actually "win".  If you achieve some nebulous amount of what you wanted often enough, you probably come back for more.  This is definitely <i>play</i>, but not a <i>game</i>.  The rules (roll to hit) and constructs (characters) and cues (dice) are all there to help us play, and give us game-like moments.<br/><br/>Maybe one or two or a thousand games arise in the course of a given RPG session!  It's all up to the play group, and the way they relate to the play tools they have.<br/><br/>So, from that perspective, we should probably assume that the players are quite capable of enjoying free play, and that the rules should serve to support free play, rather than to fight or supplant it.  Rules that inspire, for example.  Or rules that organize who gets to do what.  Or rules that can be fallen back on as crutches when free play gets stuck.<br/><br/>Hey, I just described trad "games"!<br/><br/>Take White Wolf games.  You use the char-gen etc. rules to get inspired.  You divide up into Storyteller and character-players to structure a unique social interaction.  Then you free play, and roll a shitload of d10s when free play is insufficient to quickly reach mutually acceptable outcomes.  My preference has always been, if you <i>can</i> reach good outcomes without dice, don't roll 'em.<br/><br/>If WW phrased their games this way, maybe they wouldn't get so much hate from the indie crowd.  They're perfectly fine as inspiration, organization, and crutches for free play.  They're just not proper games, and they rely on groups being good at free play in order to work.  (Well, okay, I should admit that they can suck at the vital "get the group on the same page about the point of play" issue, but only if you pay too much attention to the crutches.  Ignore that and focus on the inspiration, and you'll be fine.  That is, read the flavor text, ignore the combat rules!)<br/><br/>Having said all that, I do believe that RPGs <i>can</i> have proper game goals.  Your typical D&amp;D module, where it's win and loot or lose and die, is an example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341241/#Comment_341241" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T12:03:19+00:00" title="September  1, 2011 12:03PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 9:12AM by komradebob.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yeah Trad games are like that.<br/><br/>We don't talk too much here ( or places like RPGnet) about why trad games are good, or what we're <i>really</i> doing with them.<br/><br/>I think that's partly a commercial factor. I mean, shit dude, what would happen if somebody big just came out and said what we've said? All those rules mechanics writers? Well they wouldn't be out of a job, but we would be back to square one, with wildly dis-unified mechanics all cobbled together and a happy mess and so on.<br/><br/>I'm kinda starting to feel okay with that actually. But it is a weird starting point.<br/><br/>And really, even your D&amp;D example isn't really that different. It really just suggests it is all still a party, but maybe the game elements are harder, and we're all okay with TPK being a possible outcome. To me, tthat's still the bits of game stuck in the bigger thing, the event, as it were.<br/><br/>BTW, it was your game arc tool thingie and the way you described its use that got me thinking about some of this stuff...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341461/#Comment_341461" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-02T19:57:50+00:00" title="September  2, 2011  7:57PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 12:27PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, saying, "screw the wisdom of the folks who've been most successful at creating products for this hobby!" seems kinda stupid, although Ron Edwards' (unverified by me) contention that D&amp;D never made any money makes it less so.  But, actually, it doesn't feel that weird to me to look at White Wolf and say, "the rules writers are disposable, but keep the artists and fiction-writers: people are buying the books for that stuff, and not necessarily to even play!"  In RPG land, pretty products that get individuals to imagine might sell better than playable games.<br/><br/>So, if our objective is playable games first and sales second, ignoring industry leaders makes more sense.<br/><br/>As for a D&amp;D mod, I dunno.  Saying that you can be cool with getting TPKed isn't that different from saying you can handle losing Trivial Pursuit.  Both exist in larger social contexts, but they're both still games.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that a given D&amp;D mod <i>forces</i> you to play it as proper game; just that it's reasonably <i>clear how</i> to do that if you do in fact want to.<br/><br/>I'm glad you found the pacing dial interesting!  Different folks respond very differently to it.  At the very least, it serves as reminder/proof that I really mean it when I say "care about and express what you do and don't want to cover in play!"

Yay!!!! Talking with them, they seem very much in the old-ish 90s WW mindset...And they sound like they're having a ton of fun at it. And they seem very much of the "mechanics don't matter, we have our best time when we don't engage the system" mindset.<br/><br/>And yet, the former anthro student in me ( as well as the guy who likes to hang out at dirty hippy indie game sites) says "Hunh. There is something going on here. There's ritual/structure. There're expectations. I think there's a game there, but it isn't the one in the book mechanically, so what is the <b>actual</b> game being played???"<br/><br/>2) Once again picking back up my neverending project to make a minis non-wargame and describe the fun in that in writing so I can distribute it, even just locally among people I already know.<br/><br/>So, bringing this back full circle, I've been trying to think of the RPG activity first as a social event. I jokingly refer to it s a themed verbal-costume party, but I'm kidding on the square.<br/><br/>For me, for what I'm trying to do, I suspect this line of constrained concept, only slightly outside of the normal way we think about this stuff, might prove to be fruitful.<br/><br/>So I've been recently trying to type out my little bit of design as first and foremost a peculiar sort of party. It's changing my way of looking at not only the voice I'm trying to use, but also how I look at things like real world time, player actual goals ( as opposed to character goals or even goals of manuevering the fiction), and how and when to insert moments of game-activities and who can and should call for them and why they should.<br/><br/>Which is where I get back to the original point of this thread: When should rules ( these moments of game embedded in the greater activity in my way of thinking) be called for and used?<br/><br/>Well, one thing that got me thinking about this was the use of rolls in Cthulhu Dark. I don't have a link right now, but it's around somewhere. What struck me about that design is that a call for a roll can be made by any player at any time.<br/><br/>That's pretty different to say the least. (actually there's two main kinds of rolls that can be called for, too). Graham doesn't go into too much detail about why a player might want to call for a roll. It's just kinda assumed that experienced/natural players wil just "get" the concept and run with it.<br/><br/>As for player "actual" goals, I'm also positing that most of these have to do with social recognition. That's the level that is really relevent to people, and what makes a game group gel and continue and also perhaps interact outside of game night as a social group, and I think that's something folks are really looking for, more than a bumped up character or even a quality piece of fiction being produced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341474/#Comment_341474" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-03T00:44:50+00:00" title="September  3, 2011 12:44AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 9:15AM by komradebob.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anywho, under that approach, there's no direct conflict with use of judgment calls, because it isn't a game at all.

That approach -- focusing on social event -- makes total sense to me.  <br/><br/>I think that sometimes looking at game goals can tell the story just fine, but that's only when the game rewards dovetail with the social rewards.  In a typical RPG, we look for feedback -- e.g., a friend's glance that says "That thing you just made up was cool!" -- that formal rules usually don't give.  <br/><br/>This is why fanmail is such a potential game-changer.  (Although every attempt I've made to port it into another context has failed.  Rewarding specific things takes too much thought, and rewarding anything during character-immersion time takes the wrong kind of thought.)<br/><br/>As for the judgment calls, I think knowing when to invoke which procedure is still a major component of a successful activity, even if the correct answer is subjective rather than objective.  The connection between chatting and bobbing for apples is made only by the social glue, and the transition between the two can be haphazard, subject to disagreement and debate or inertia, poorly presented, or whatever.  In RPGs, I think most of us prefer a stronger connection between free roleplay and rules use than "we're all buddies here", and we prefer to not break roleplay for debates about whether or not to use a rule.  Arguing about whether to bob for apples can be a fun form of socializing and a completely <i>not</i> fun form of RPG play.  Unless you, y'know, find a way to <i>make</i> it fun.<br/><br/>The pacing dial is often invoked by "if you're <i>not</i> having fun" and requires no discussion or consensus, so that's an example of one approach.  But I think the typical question for rules use is-<br/><br/>Oh, hey, that's relevant to this thread.  Time to unwhisper?  Anyway:<br/><br/>When we can't easily agree on what happens next in the fiction.  Like, what does the undead ninja do to Fred's character Dogboy with his attack?  Either no one wants to take responsibility for it, or people have conflicting ideas about it, or it takes forever to weigh the pros and cons of the options.  This is more complex and time-sensitive than most decisions made at a party, right?<br/>- killing Dogboy would be dramatic and exciting and show off the ninja as a scary foe!<br/>- killing Dogboy would mean Fred can't play him anymore... what else can Fred do now?<br/>- horribly maiming Dogboy would fit with game's chosen genre of Action/Horror<br/>- but the good guy wins Action movies, so Dogboy shouldn't be disabled<br/>- Fred had a good idea for avoiding the attack, and we don't want to ignore it<br/>- based on what's been described in the fiction, it seems most likely that the ninja would miss Fred<br/>- if the Ninja misses Fred, wouldn't he hit the electric field and be instantly vaporized? but that's stupid... but fictional consequences are important...<br/><br/>We have rules so that at times like this, the game designer steps in and says, "By agreeing to play my game, you have submitted to <i>my</i> determination of what should happen here, which is as follows:"<br/><br/>And then if we hate the outcome we can say we hate the game without having to hate each other.  And if we like the outcome, then hey, awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341552/#Comment_341552" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-04T11:28:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2011 11:28AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 9:17AM by komradebob.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right!<br/><br/>Now what i'm trying to figure out is how to give succinct guidelines for the subjective parts!

No playing Fritz Von Wackenstein, the Mad Director with stats or anything). The mechanics that exist are all up at the player level. The stuff that mechanics usually exist for, the in-fiction stuff, is pretty much glossed over and pushed back up to decisions at the player level.<br/><br/>Which does mean that, well, it's inevitably pretty subjective and clear that actual people present at the thing are going to be making decisions about the fiction and also when to engage mechanics.<br/><br/>The flipside is that most of your example stuff about the characters is going to have to be decided by the players on the fly. The exception being the issue of what happens to Fred's ability to play. One core principle I want to work in is that everybody does get to play throughout, but then also no one is inherently attached mechanically to a single character ( although I expect and forese that people will indeed become attached and consistently play certain characters in the "film" being made).<br/><br/>I'm also, frankly, a bit of a dirty-hippy.  Just the sort of person who would give out all sorts of gold stars to children if I was a teacher, and for all sorts of things, because I think recognizing contributions are an important part of this kind of thing. They'd go to the players, and be player to player given, and on multiple different sorts of grounds. I'm still working on that as well.<br/><br/>Mechanically, I'm also planning a post production wrap session where particpants get to decide how the just produced "film" goes over. One result is that it bombs horribly or the project gets cancelled by the studio. Others are results are happier ( Breakout Success!!!) but all are in the hands of the group as a whole. Similarly, there's a tally of different sorts of points and awards for Best [fill in blank]s of different sorts as a finale to the "game" portion of the social event.<br/><br/>More broadly than my project though, I think this does get to the idea that why people play and their goals and win conditions on the social level sometimes are a bad mismatch for wins mechanically.<br/><br/>I wonder if there is some broad way to clarify the sorts of things that are goals/vicctories/defeats on tha social level. The old Bonus XPs for Good Roleplaying seems to be getting onto that track partway. What are the other sorts of things people value in players in common post-D&amp;D trad play?<br/><br/>I'm also seeing a parallel to the more negative concept that <i>You Can't Resolve Out of Game Problems With In Game Solutions </i>here.<br/><br/>In this case, I'm thinking that you shouldn't reward Above Fiction Level Good Stuff by In fiction rewards. But, you should, somehow, recognize and reward it, and more officially. Even if it sounds a bit dirty-hippy school teacher-ish at first.<br/><br/>I mean, at some level, we alrready do reward that stuff don't we? If someone does a great character portrayal that we ove as a group, we tend to give them spotlight time that lets them be a bitty spotlight piggie for a bit. If someone has a great idea, we tend to incorporate it. If someone is just a plain good plays well with other people sort, we tend to invite them back again, even if they aren't a great actor or plotmeister.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know that just veered wildly off, but here I'll bring it around to rules use of a sort more broad than my personal project.<br/><br/>Good timing of calling for rules use, good choice of rules use ( appropriate? dramatic? fair and not badger-y? keeps things moving rather than pointlessly slowing things down ( your arc here)?), all kinds of stuff regarding rules use really...that's on point for social recognition as well.<br/><br/>Informally, that kind of subjective rules use will have all kinds of impact on whether people enjoy themselves and whether they come back to play again. It will also have all kinds of impact on <i>how</i> a group plays again. Do they come back for a totally new game, like a one-shot or short arc with a different GM? Do they jump into an open-ended campaign with a single consistent GM? Do they give one another leeway to freeplay? Do they end up finding ceratin kinds of mechanical play is inherently fun and agree to engage with it, or do they simply tolerate it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341573/#Comment_341573" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-04T20:55:11+00:00" title="September  4, 2011  8:55PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 12:27PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh!  "Good call on using that rule for that!  Here's a Social Point!"  That's an exciting idea!<br/><br/>It kinda inverts the normal gameplay expectations, though.  Normally, you do stuff in a game to succeed in the game, and then the social rewards follow that based on how your group values that kind of performance.  Most games don't try to manage that higher-level "I like playing with you!" stuff.  It can be <i>awkward</i>, and it tends to mess up the "special <i>game space</i>" that's a hallmark of gameplay.  <br/><br/>I have a game where you reward each other for spouting good conspiracy theories, but the process of determining and communicating "I see how you've connected those two elements to each other and to a conspiracy, so yes, here is a token" makes it hard to roleplay your characters.  So <i>distraction</i> is an additional RPG hurdle (though maybe less so for B Movie).<br/><br/>I guess it depends on how easily the "well played!" reward-giving process integrates with the primary activity of play.  Y'know -- just because people may ultimately play to feel liked, they don't want to play the "take turns liking each other" game.  They want to just do an activity that they're good at and let their peers see and appreciate it.  I'm good at making shit up -- give me a game where the group needs for lots of shit to be made up, and suddenly I rock!<br/><br/>So, to me, your proposal sounds best-suited to a game-activity <i>about</i> creativity.  So maybe it should be about, like, making movies or something.  Huh.  That's kind of brilliant!  You might need to spend more play time on the making than the movie, but that's just a hunch.<br/><br/>Can you give me a dialogue snippet of how you'd expect this to go?  Like:<br/><br/>P1: I think Blood on the Noodles needs a shocking soundtrack!  Something raw and industrial, unpleasant scraping sounds and whatnot!<br/><br/>P2: Eww.  Then no one will want to watch it.<br/><br/>P3: No, wait, we just need to turn it way down, barely audible, so it's putting people on edge without grabbing their attention!<br/><br/>P4: Brilliant!  P1, here's a blue Inspiration token, and P3, here's a black Problem-solving token!<br/><br/>P1: Aww, thanks, P4, here's a Good Teammate gold star.<br/><br/>P3: I think this is a big risk for audience response.  Let's roll on the Wild Card Table to see if it sparks riots or gets us praised as geniuses or something.<br/><br/>P2: Good call!  Here's a yellow Tool Use token.<br/><br/>I'm still drawing a blank on how to import that into "normal" roleplaying.  I mean, I'm sure there's a way!  But, if one of the goals is to highlight the act of roleplaying, as opposed to system-manipulation, then social management rules need to stay out of the way as much as fiction resolution rules do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341575/#Comment_341575" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-04T21:02:50+00:00" title="September  4, 2011  9:02PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 12:28PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Separately:<br/><br/>A few months ago, Lula and I were brainstorming a make-a-movie game where everyone roleplays a different part of the team vying for creative control against the others.  The star wants to look more badass in this scene, so he has his agent harass the producers with contractual crap until they give in.  The composer wants a song in this scene, so he busts out a list of movies publicized by their hit albums.  All this jockeying is resolved as the scene is narrated, so you get to cover the whole film in play.  At the end, depending on how much agent-harassment, album publicizing, etc. has gone on, the movie will make each participant look good or bad and will rank high or low on various scales like tickets sold and critical acclaim.<br/><br/>So, um feel free to steal some of that, or rope one or both of us into a collaboration!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341586/#Comment_341586" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T00:10:28+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 12:10AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in reverse order, my answers/comment/babbling:<br/><br/>Regarding your movie making idea about members of a film company vying for crative control:<br/><br/>That's actually really very close to what my initial thoughts were like, and I still have some inclination to go in that direction. I'm personally still sorting out my own feelings in that regard.<br/><br/>At this point I'm mostly shooting for a co-operative activity, although please don't take that to mean consensus only or without challenge. I'm thinking more in terms of the challenge being related to stuff like " Can you work in someone else's ideas?" and "Can you pick really good times to call for some rolls that split things into different plot directions", "Can you pull in loose plot threads in a satisfying way?"<br/><br/>I think I would still like to pull some of the kinds of things you're talking about in for an "Advanced" version or rules add-on for the project.<br/><br/>Weirdly enough, one of the side concepts I'd been working on was a between sessions planning party party activty/event. In that one "Studios" would show up at a soiree ( like, an actual party for the real people) and try to hawk their ideas for game events ( where the film is "made"), and one of the ideas I had was for people to make up their own persona to represent the various actors, directors, whatever who the Studios were trying to recruit for their next film project. In this case, the social level "wins" would be in terms of what projects were next to be produced and who was invited along to participate. Hamming it up as the Hollywood types schmoozing one another would be a big part of the fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341587/#Comment_341587" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T00:53:53+00:00" title="September  5, 2011 12:53AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now, I can't really give you a good idea of what I imagine dialog to be like, because with what I'm imagining, there is both in game dialog where there are scenes going on and basically freeplay, and there's also inbetween "filming" periods which amount to brainstorming development, and there's also Real People Socializing periods.<br/><br/>Can I give you a rough outline instead?<br/><br/>First off, I really do want ot clarify that my major goal is to give people like me who love miniatures gaming toys something to do with them other than play wargames/battle games, even if the toys themselves are bitty soldier types. Even if the film being created is an action movie/war movie themed thing. If you've evr gotten a chance to find an online copy of HG Wells Floor Games, it gives a good example of miniatures toy play that isn't a wargame. I want to take that sort of imaginative toy play, but gussy it up a bit and make it fun and acceptable for real lie adult people, wargamers or not.<br/><br/>Sooo...this thing is going to be meant as a multi-form. Which is basically just an Aussie term for games that don't fit neatly into the categories of LARP, notr tabletop, nor wargame ( assuming minis and terrain are used, which they may or may not be depending on a particular design. Obviously, I'm interested in the ones that do use that kind of stuff).<br/><br/>Okay, so, initial planning. Some guy or gal, like me, looks at their collection of toys and puts together a mental list of things they'd like to use. They pick a themed set, probably more than they'll ever actually envision using. Trust me, us minis fans do tend to either personally own a lot of stuff and/or know other inis heads they can borrow stuff from for a given theme.<br/><br/>We'll call them the Producer, or maybe The Studio. I haven't quite decided yet.<br/><br/>Then they come up with a basic concept, kinda like an elevator pitch for a movie, that relates to their collection. Well, actually, the two go hand in hand, so I'm not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg exactly. They may come up with a title. They also should come up with some basic stuff. Maybe some key characters, maybe some names, maybe just some stuff that they really think ought to be in a film of the type that's going to be made.<br/><br/><b>A key thing here though is to not over create at this stage.</b><br/><br/>So, here's someting I came up with and tried to run a couple of years back with different ( but related) mechanical concepts:<br/><br/><b>Title:</b> <i>The Eight Red Devils of Juarez and The Curse of Dracula </i>(title given in Spanish)<br/><br/><b>Theme Concept</b>: A cheap, crazy Mexican B-Movie in the vein of those weird old movies from Mexico you used to find in bargain bins of VHS tapes. Stuff like where <br/>Luchadors would be fighting Amazon Aztec Wome from Mars.<br/><br/><b>Plot Concept</b>: It's the middle of the Mexican Revolution. There's a small village somewhere in the boonies of Mexico where Dracula has been secretly imprisoned. Greedy treasure seekers have disturbed his prison and awakened the King of Monsters. A group of dangerous ex-Villista banditos are being pursued by corrupt and greedy Mexican Army soldiers, and have come across the village while looking for a place to hole up. Downtrodden but fierce village women and their local priest face off against Banditos, the Mexican Army, and Dracula and his growing army of monsters ( who are all fighting with one another too). What will happen??????<br/><br/>Of course, at this point, they gather the appropriate toys and maybe come up with some other elements. A few key character names (initial). Maybe some ague motivations. They probably also should come up with a few things like "Must-have" events, stuff thta only seems right to have happen. A bar fight. Someone gets turned into a monster. A betrayal between the bad guys. Maybe a love triangle. A bad guy switches sides.<br/><br/>Again, brief and vague. None of that is set in stone, and Must-have is in quotes because while it's going to be strongly recommended, it isn't a 100% sure thing, but more an indication of the Studio's vison for the thing. A bit like the formula that Barton Fink keeps getting pushed on him by the studio head in that film for wrestling movies they want him to make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341589/#Comment_341589" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T01:59:57+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  1:59AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued]<br/><br/>Right, so there's the broad fictional basis for the thing. The Studio is going to be the event initiator and likely the host for the party. Their job now is to get some pals together to play the thing. I think a minumum of 3 is necessay and the sweet spot is probabiy 4-5, with max out at 8. I could see slightly more playing if the party/social aspect was big and people were wandering in and out of active play, which might actually work well under the right circumstances. I wouldn't go more than 12 unless you were really planning for some people to be off socializing outside of the main play area and nobody was drinking too much.<br/><br/>Space consideration:<br/><br/>A table for the toys is necessary. I'm going to call this the Studio Backlot. The Studio lays this out ahead of time. There are some considerations.<br/><br/>The Backlot needs to be accessible and needs to be off limits for food and drink, so other areas for that stuff will also be necessary. Near the same space, there needs to be some room to move around, for when things go briefly LARPy ( which I hope they will). <br/><br/>A few chairs should be handy for people to rest or use in Larpy situations, but people aren't going to be expected to sit around the table the way you would in a tabletop RPG or Wargame.<br/><br/>There also needs to be some space for either a wipe board or a fold out card table or a big sheet of paper to write stuff on or similar. It really will depend on what you have to work with. This is just a space for spitballing ideas and keeping track of them. It needs to be accessible to people, but a card table and note cards or eally any number of solutions could work.<br/><br/>For the set up of the Backlot itself, we go a bit away from a standard tabletop minis battlegame mindset, and try to think a bit more like a film studio. It needs to be only roughly set out in its supposed physical relationship. Interior sets and exterior sets don't need to be in proper consistent scale to one another, and they only need to be representative of the stuff that is likely to be relevent to the film.<br/><br/>There should also be some space available for re-arranging as play develops.<br/><br/>One table edge or all edges can be considered to be Casting/Props room areas. That's where extra stuff can be stashed, whether it's toys that might be sued or dice or extra index cards or whatever. Things in those areas are just there to be convenient and aailable. They don't represent stuff physically there the way tey might in a wargame.<br/><br/>Optimally, there should also be a lounge area where food, conversation, and so on is encouraged and people can take a breather from the game activity. It could be for extra people not directly playing or for the presumed/scheduled break periods.<br/><br/>Time outline:<br/>As a conceit, the production crew ( that is, all of the players) have a total of 6 Weeks ( six real time hours) to shoot the project from start to finish.<br/><br/>As a further conceit, there is only enough film for 4 hours of filming ( although naturally that will be cut down in editing to make a proper film for release). Again this is 4 hours of real time.<br/><br/>This is a working concept. The idea really about keeping things relatively focussed for a one-day event, like a house party game, so maybe something that starts at 1pm on a Satruday and ends by 7pm ish. It could go longer or shorter and I'm playing with ideas for that related to the type of film ( A pilot for a series on TV vs. a Feature Film vs. A Saturday Morning Serial movie episode, for example).<br/><br/>Real world time:<br/>The folks show up more or less randomly as they tend to and you let 'em look at all the cool stuff and talk freely about concepts while settling in. Catch up for a while, have drink, and slowly ease into general socializing. This is pre-production and doesn't count against time limits. People can start brainstorming a bit too, and write ideas about characters on cards/board and post them or whatever you have. Make sure they initial anything they write down. Don't take too long though.<br/><br/>Official start of brainstorming<br/>Start on an easily rememberable time mark (write it down) and begin the official brainstorming session. This is just semi directed bull session related to the film project: Some character development concepts, ideas about sets, placing toys around the backlot and so on. Take maybe 15 minutes. Remeber to write ideas down and put initials by them.<br/><br/>When it looks like something has cooked pretty well, go on to the next production step: Casting Call<br/><br/>Everybody who is playing tries out for parts. You should have some characters by now, certainly your lead characters, heroes villains, rivals, etc. Everyone should "auditon" for one character they'd like to play. Take turns however seems best. The person auditioning should give a sentence or two about how they imagine the character. Then, they should give a short example of how they'd play them. Other players can call out suggestions or ask questions or set up situations. Other participants can be called on if need be to step in as another already reated character or one made up on the fly. Auditions should only be maybe a minute or two long. Players should ham it up a bit, using voices, body language, speaking patterns, whatever.<br/><br/>It's not only perfectly okay if multiple people audition for a given character, it's encouraged. Just make sure that all characters already created have been covered.<br/><br/>Second round of auditions: Players now choose a different player and a different character than the one they originally auditioned for and have them try the role out. Otherwise, as before. Encourage players to pick some less developed characters to hae their pals audition for. Choosing wildly inappropriate seeming player to character comboes for this round should be incredibly enlightening and thus encouraged.<br/><br/>This might take up to 30 minutes. Don't go too much longer!!!<i>No one inherently gets a role from the audition</i>. The goal is to see what the group collectively is thinking and gets some further character development, as well as get some audience feedback from the group on who does a good/interesting interpretation/portrayal of the characters the project is working with.<br/><br/>Wrap this part up and write down the time used and announce it. This comes out of the total Production Time ( the 6 hours).<br/><br/>Take about a five minute breather for Real World socializing and get ready for the initial scene shooting. This doesn't count against Production Time. Let people schmooze and grab drinks, but also encourage further brainstorming and chatting about plot and characters.<br/><br/><b>Initial Shoot/ Test Shoots of Opening Scenes</b><br/>This is the nitty gritty part of opening up the story.<br/><br/>There will be Four Scenes shot.<br/><br/><i>and I'll get back to that part, because it's late here and I'm really very sleepy....</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341608/#Comment_341608" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T09:22:19+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  9:22AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks, this thread is going to look strange for a bit.
