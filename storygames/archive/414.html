                    Well, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock:</a> is nearing completion. I'm dealing with my printer, I'm having my rules text edited, I just finished the bibliography (12 pages all by itself, assuming I don't think of anything else to go in there!), and this thing, as you might suspect, is bigger than intended. I still have examples to write (good lord, that's hard work), but the light at the end of the tunnel has been confirmed as Sanctuary, and not a Sandman's flashlight.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who's playtested for me. Thanks for the critique and direction.<br/>
<br/>
And hey, if you haven't heard of the game or want to know something about it, this thread's probably an excellent place to ask.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to pre-order a signed copy of the first print run of the book, PM me to make arrangements.                </div>

                            Oh, yeah, since people are whispering the obvious questions: $23 plus $4 in the US, $5.25 international.<br>

You can Paypal it to me: joshua@glyphpress.com.<br>
<br>
This offer's open until I'm done writing and designing and it goes off to the printer. Then you'll have to wait until Brennan makes the announcement at IPR.<br>
<br>
Thanks folks!<br/>

Also, I wish I was going to hit my March target. I'm gettin' as close as I can, though!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Kuma, yeah, A PDF will be available. I don't know what pricing will be for it. That will take a conference with my colleagues that I haven't had yet. I <i>guess</i> you could pre-order a PDF if I had the price, but I don't, so you can't. <br/><br/>Also, the colon stands in for all punctuation, including a colon (and excepting a question mark or exclamation point). So one will do.<br/><br/>Maybe the second edition of Shock: will be called Shock::?<br/><br/>Guy, the UtB revision was put on hold until I could get Shock: done. I'd say, end of April? Sorry to keep you (and a few others) waiting. Some of them have even sent me money when I don't even have anything to sell! I just had to get my priorities clear with these two projects. Shock: is, of course, more complicated than I anticipated and has taken a lot more of my game design efforts over the last couple of months than I anticipated.<br/><br/>Let this be a lesson to anyone planning on publishing: don't announce a release date. It does no one any good. Just keep interested parties updated as you approach release. Burning Wheel takes this another step further, telling no one anything before release. I'm not sure that's so great, either; it's not like they don't sell out of books every time they make a run, but I think there are probably players out there who would get hot for their supplements if Luke et al. let people know what they were working on.<br/><br/>It's a tough thing to figure out! I think a lot of mainstream media are really brutal with their buzz generation to the point that their audiences are becoming cynical.<br/><br/>Under the Bed was released with zero publicity. It was an experiment with that, and it had the predictable results: no one had heard of the game when it was released. Once it came out, there were some great AP posts that helped sell it, but there would have been more out of the gate if people knew it was coming.<br/><br/>So I'm trying to learn from that experience: telling people about Shock: before it's released, letting them know what it will be like, showing under the hood during its development. A fair number of people are interested in it, and they know what it is now. All you folks who are pre-ordering are the vanguard of the game's arc, the punk fans who knew the band when it was still in the garage. So I'm thankful to you for getting the word out and being the first on the ground to explain and get your krewes playing. You're a resource I wouldn't have without this pre-release talk.<br/><br/>Oh, and one last thing: if you want to pay with a credit card instead of directly though PayPal, please send money to joshyspam@swingpad.com instead of the glyphpress address. Thanks, and sorry if I had to reject your payment!                        </div>

Josh totally sold out. He was SO much better when only me and my three friends were buying his albums.  Now he's all "Corporate" and "The Man"-ish.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
