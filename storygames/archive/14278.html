I'd prefer it be someone from here than Random Dudefellow From The Internet (though, I know that most of you qualify for that title, I feel like we're a slightly closer-knit community than, say, RPG.net).<br/><br/>Is anyone looking for a temporary roommate?  I mostly just need a place to keep my clothes and sleep.  I'm Canadian - we're known for our being neat and polite, right?  <br/><br/>Hit me up with a whisper?  I want to go to GenCon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
