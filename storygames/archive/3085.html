First time posting here, though I've lurked for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm running a sword&amp;sorcery; game set in the world of Conan. Using, naturally, TSOY as system. Now there is a slight problem with the game as it goes too easy. Most likely it is only that the players and I aren't really adjusted to tsoy way yet, but in the grand tradition of fixing things that aren't broke:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Story-arc card</b>. It is bit of cardboard that has a goal ("I steal the Jewels of Gwahlur!") with a harm track on it. It is like an npc, except that it is not a person and when you 'kill it' you achieve the goal written. Difference with bdtp is that you can have several of these going at the same time (which is the reason you really need a token for it), they don't have to be just one scene and the opposition may be inanimate or incabable of fighting back. If you transcend you get to complete the arcs you have open.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are few different types. One small track with 3 boxes, one with full six boxes and perhaps one with pair of tracks if there is someone else trying to achieve the same goal before you or otherwise stopping you. Could look something like this <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~aleator/arc-cards.pdf" rel="nofollow">this(link)</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is this supposed to fix?<br/>\n<br/>\nTSOY is about choices, relationships and <u>the characters</u>. How do I conclude that? Because it is an easy game. If you need to roll a 6 (the best result you can without getting a new character) at the first session, you can without a lot of an effort. What gets it interesting would then be bit like in dogs: moral choices, relationships and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\nConan is about challanges. Or rather about Conan overcoming said challanges. Except sometimes it is about revenges. No one really cares about Jewels of Gwahlur. We care about how cool it looks when Conan goes about stealing them and the people (girls) he meets on the way. In tsoy, with my group, you could end up with "P: I get the Jewels of Gwahlur!, &lt;roll !&gt; GM: Ok. You explore the temple and find the Jewels. What now? P: &lt;sighs with boredom&gt;". Or that I as a GM push for smaller stakes, such as climbing the walls, searching, fighting monsters. Which is almost exactly like the story-card idea, except informal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do I think I get with these?<br/>\n<br/>\n* The cards act as training wheels by remembering me to keep things complicated and players not to take too big steps at once.<br/>\n* Slower pacing during which we can explore the characters better.<br/>\n* Another opportunity for cool secrets. "Secret of The Barbarian:  when the arc is about violence, subtract one harm done against you're goal."<br/>\n* Another prop to the gaming table.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the problems?<br/>\n<br/>\n* It is not exactly clear how to calculate harm towards the goals.<br/>\n* This overlaps bit uncomfortably with keys. What would you do if your Key of Mission would come with harm tracker included?<br/>\n* How likely it is to go out of synch with the actual play on the table? You slay the opposing general and get bad result on check to advance the arc? (this really frustrated us with Burning Empires)<br/>\n* Accidentally making a goal about something trivial.<br/>\n* Anything else?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70597/#Comment_70597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-20T06:57:03+00:00" title="May 20, 2007  6:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To focus laser-like on some tiny aspects of the big and exciting thing you have said:<br><br>First, it would be, as I see it, totally unacceptable if a Key of Mission came with a harm tracker.  If I have a Key of Mission, it's because I want my character to be a [noun] on a Mission.  You'd be making an aspect of my character destructible by the actions of other characters as they worked to harm the goal, and without giving me any clear recourse: I-character <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wants</span> the goal to be completed, and would happily accept any help towards that end, contrary to I-player's wishes.<br><br>Also, can't missions sometimes be without limiting conditions.  Can't I have a mission of "Protect the Princess/Widget/Country" or something?  Then the state of the key is even more obviously a way for me to influence the content of the game.<br><br>Second, if your group was frustrated with right action on the ground being paired with setbacks in the greater setting in <i>Burning Empires</i>, I'm not sure if this is going to work out for them.  The thing which you're trying to fix is people rapidly achieving their goals and not knowing where to go from there (and let me say, from my running-<i>TSOY</i>-experience, I am totally with you there), and the thing that you're hoping to achieve is more time for moral and emotional exploration, but if in the past you've seen your players watch arc-trackers as a sign of their performance, then you may be introducing a mechanic for frustration.  If one of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> players kills a general and doesn't advance the "Crush your enemies and see them driven before you!" arc much, would they take heart from the fact that they had done a cool thing and still had more time to do more cool things?  Or would they see the second roll as having bogarted their coolness?  <br><br>I'm not making any guesses as to the answer.  You're the one who can find out.  I'm just trying to make sure you've considered it.<br><br>Now, to return to the general cool thing:<br><br>Are you familiar at all with <i>Capes</i>?  It has a mechanic very similar to what you're talking about here.  Players can Declare Goals or Events, which are conflicts linked to some story occurence.  "Goal: Dr. Malicious robs the bank."  "Event: The time-bomb goes off."  That sort of thing.  The thing is, before that goal was declared, anyone could have just said that Dr. Malicious robbed the bank as part of their narration accomplishing something else.  Before the Event was declared, nothing would protect us from the bomb going off.  But after they have been, no one can narrate that unless they roll dice and win the conflict.  So, to analogize, declaring a goal or event in <i>Capes</i> is a lot like bringing down the pain in <i>Shadow</i>, in that it involves a player saying "This is cool, let's pay attention to it," and in that it dilates the action with respect to some single task/occurrence.  I've found it a lot of fun.  Have you considered that maybe the goal with your group and these arc cards is to make them player- or group-created?  Accidentally trivial goals would be rare, then.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70641/#Comment_70641" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-20T15:22:37+00:00" title="May 20, 2007  3:22PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I point you to my alternative, but slightly similar, solution in <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Errantry.pdf" rel="nofollow">Errantry</a>?. Because this is a (Solar-System-based) quest game, it involves collecting what I originally referred to as "plot tokens" - they got renamed "boons" for genre-appropriateness.<br><br>Basically, you can use your successes to gain some kind of useful thing, piece of information or help from an NPC, and when you have enough of them (as defined by a reducing pile of tokens of a size you determined at the start of the game) you use any that you haven't already used to fulfil your quest.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
