This is an RPG based on the computer game... no, <i>inspired by</i> the computer game. <br/><br/>The structure of the game is in seasons. Each season, every player can gather supplies, vote on whether or not to Open the Gates! (basically, to let the outside world in, for good and for ill), and work on one commissioned project. You *can* do any of these things; gathering supplies is pretty important, but you don't have to do it, if you're okay with the consequences.<br/>Gathering supplies is resolved first, and then everybody votes on whether to Open the Gates! <br/>Then we take 2d6, assign one die as "good fortune" and the other as "ill fortune". Higher is usually a more intense result - so higher good is better, higher ill is worse. Double sixes means you've found a tunnel to the underworld, which is chock full of monsters, gems, rare metals, and natural phenomena. <br/>If you want to work on a commissioned project, you can decide to do so at any point in the season. <br/><br/>Free play comes between each of these things. It figures into these various checks and rolls like so: <br/><br/>The consequences for a bad supply check can put your character's friendships in jeopardy (long hours at work - where you been, man?), but if you don't do it at all, you're guaranteed to have shortages. A good supply check can net you a surplus in a particular thing, like safety, food, ore, or living space. <br/>A good commission roll means the thing you made is really great, and will give you one lucky break, one time. A bad commission roll means the project is Doomed, and the GM can unleash a terrible thing, one time, on someone or through someone using the thing, whatever it is (a bridge collapses, a sword kills someone's wife, etc.)<br/>Open the Gates! introduces new characters, generally - be they merchants, refugees, nobledwarfs seeking to commandeer the fort, skilled tradesdwarfs, goblin raiders, kobold thieves... or maybe your scouts stumble on a nearby human- or elf-town while out ranging! A double-six, as I mentioned, means you locate a cleft that leads to the underworld.<br/><br/>That all said, the type of play I'm trying to produce is basically frontier-town survival fiction, with hard-pressed relationships, scarcity all over, and constant background threats of violence and loss of autonomy.<br/><br/>Hopefully that helps! It certainly helps *me* to see it all laid out like that - it's looking pretty good! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302005/#Comment_302005" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T17:31:31+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  5:31PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat.  <br/><br/>My first thought is that it would be cool if characters had an affinity for a certain particular kind of basic work -- the resource gathering part, and when you choose to act in accord with that affinity, you gather more/better/faster, whatever.  It would be neat if that affinity were luck of the draw.  On top of that, you'd have a trade (probably a single trade would be best) in which the character was trained that you choose.  And when you work on a commissioned project that fits your trade, you produce more/better/faster.  On top of that, maybe some kind of Great Work becomes available as your commissioned project but only when you have a certain level of mastery over your trade skill and/or a mood takes you.  So I guess, I'm in favor of option four, but with pretty severe benefit for working inside your specialties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302019/#Comment_302019" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T19:50:00+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  7:50PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good, Chris. <br/>And by "severe benefit" do you mean "a lot of benefit"? I'm guessing yes. <br/><br/>Just as an aside, at this point the resource gathering and the project-commission...ing are both handled with a d4 roll. I'm debating whether to increase the size to d6, to allow for more factors (and for less stinginess with the bonuses! +1 on a d4 means a lot). <br/><br/>Great Works, strange moods, and artifacts haven't actually made it into this design - maybe something like "spend a unit of surplus appropriate to your profession, and work long hours, to the detriment of one relationship" could turn a commission into a Great Work/artifact. Gotta think on this one... this begs the question "What do Great Works do?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302022/#Comment_302022" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-23T20:21:22+00:00" title="November 23, 2010  8:21PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2010 8:21PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This Hocus move from Apocalypse World is intriguing:\n<blockquote><i><b>Fortunes:</b> fortune, surplus and want all depend on your followers. <br/>At the beginning of the session, roll+fortune.
