He seems like he is ready to handle some simple rules and basic turn-taking.  I was wondering what the general opinion of smart game lovers is of the games that might be appropriate for this age range.  I realize there probably isn't anything out there that is approachable for him that I would really find engaging (except in the way that playing with my son is always engaging, of course), but I'm wondering if there's anything out there besides Candyland and Chutes and Ladders that I should be looking at.<br/>Thanks,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling" title="Maltese_Changeling"><img alt="Maltese_Changeling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling">Maltese_Changeling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244228/#Comment_244228" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T09:00:11+00:00" title="November 30, 2009  9:00AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At 3, a stripped-down version of Carcasonne is possible (i.e., no farmers whatsoever).

My daughter (6) still shows little inclination to follow rules or take turns, so I play much more freeform games with her, basically collaborative storytelling. I'll tell a story, then ask her a leading question to get her to start telling the story for a while.<br/><br/>My daughter watches me play games, and sometimes makes up her own versions of them, which I play with her. We made up a version of How to Host a Dungeon called How to Host a Princess Party. I made a simple d6 table of possible guests to the Princesses birthday party. She rolls, and then adds that guest to the party. She routinely fudges the rolls to get the guest she wants.<br/><br/>After watching me play Race for the Galaxy with her godfather, she created a game called "Fortunes and Misfortunes". We take turns drawing from the deck and placing the cards in a row. Each card adds a fortune or misfortune to the story. For example, the Rebel Outpost is a castle that the Princess visits (a fortune). The Alien Scout Ship is a "bad spider" misfortune. Oddly enough, almost all my cards turn out to be misfortunes and hers turn out to be fortunes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244244/#Comment_244244" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T10:18:40+00:00" title="November 30, 2009 10:18AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may want to check out <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/shadows/shadows.html" rel="nofollow">Shadows</a>.

There aren't really any choices for the players to make, but one of the first things to learn about games, it seems (even if one goes on to "unlearn" it later) is the notion of how rules (moving x number of square, taking turns, etc.) shape play.

We take turns hitting each other: I tell her what she needs to hit, and she rolls the die (usually a d8--she likes those). If she hits, she rolls another die for damage (usually a d6--gotta keep it fair).

I tried playing Uno with my daughter (who, I believe, was 5 or 6 at the time) and she quickly got overwhelmed by the number of cards in her hand. She eventually stopped looking through her hand for the card she needed and resorted to drawing more cards, which just accelerated the problem. <br><br>They can manage a game like War or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-200-Slamwich/dp/B00000DMFS" rel="nofollow">Slamwich</a> where you just lay down your top card each turn, but an Uno hand would get too large for them to handle.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
