Apocalypse World is an obvious example, with its ample lists all throughout, be they of character names, possible questions to ask, qualities for stuff, and so on. How We Came To Live Here doesn't exactly seem as obvious, but in my time with the game I came to see nothing as so important than the list of possible sins. That list was passed around regularly between the players, while the Inside and Outside players would cackle balefully. Most recently, I was playing in a playtest of Brennan Taylor's Bulldogs using Fate, and he did a very neat thing with alien races, where every race has a set of six or so aspects, of which any individual member has only two. So every race has its own list of aspects which players must choose from when creating characters. <br/><br/>Its this last one that really got me thinking, because normally aspects function in an open fashion. They're defined somewhat, in that "this aspect should be your trouble," "this aspect should be your high concept," kind of way. Even outside of the DFRPG, the same holds true; in SotC, you know your phase one aspects should indicate who you were before World War I, while your phase two aspects should indicate who you were and what you did during the war, and so on. But never had I encountered in Fate pre-set lists of aspects, from which I was only allowed, and was in fact required, to pick two for my character. It changed everything for me, immediately. It wasn't creatively constraining in the slightest; in a way, it was freeing. I knew what the alien species was like immediately by looking at that list, and then by picking two from the list, I knew exactly what type of individual my guy was, within the spectrum of the race as a whole. And those first two aspects (which, for those wondering, were "Vicious Little Bastard" and "Never Met a Vice I Didn't Try") had major weight for my thought process in picking every other aspect. It was invigorating. <br/><br/>Part of this was clearly the list itself, the aspects that were on it and their high quality, yes. But another part of it was the thrill I received from being handed something by someone else and running with it. The rules said, "Here are your options. Pick two." And I got a major kick out of, first, making that selection, and second, taking it forward. It's the same kick I get again and again and again from AW, and it's the same kick I got every single time I looked at that list of sins and said, "Okay, now, how can I work 'laying with an animal' into my plans, because I totally need those extra dice?"<br/><br/>I was wondering if anybody else knew of any other games that used lists effectively in this fashion, or if not, then why other games with lists don't quite succeed in the same way. Or maybe even if you think it's not really the form and function of a "list" so much as it is the contents of the lists in these games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303924/#Comment_303924" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T12:40:42+00:00" title="December 10, 2010 12:40PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2010 5:25PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be flippant, but ..

I never really played AD&amp;D, not until 3rd or 4th ed. I have the books for AD&amp;D, but I was young at the time, and when I did play it was a severely reduced form of the game. So I barely ever cracked the book except to sometimes look at spells and weapons. <br/><br/>But I'm curious about those lists in AD&amp;D. I have no idea to which lists you might be referring to, and it might very well be those spell and weapon lists. I wouldn't think, though, that it would invigorate me in quite the same fashion. Maybe the spells, in that "use them in creative ways" sense. But still, not quite the same thing. Care to elaborate at all, or just wanna tell me "go look at the book"?<br/><br/>And duh, of course. Should've thought of In A Wicked Age and Fiasco, both of which definitely fit in with this. Those examples raise another question to my mind, but I'll hold off for the moment, to see if anyone else points out examples that make me thwap my forehead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303929/#Comment_303929" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T13:10:42+00:00" title="December 10, 2010  1:10PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not an RPG or story game, but I just played Pandemic for the first time.

This can be a short list, or a longer list. OD&amp;D has Fighter, Cleric, and Magic-user. AD&amp;D has 10 or 12 different character classes. Your class is probably the most important part of your character.<br/><br/><b>Equipment!</b> You roll to see how much money you start with, and then you buy stuff with it, off one or more lists of equipment. These are the basic tools you have to negotiate the dungeon with. Spells and skills and stuff are extra bonuses, and even weapons and armour are often restricted based on class -- but everybody has access to flaming oil, lanterns, ropes, grappling hooks, iron spikes, and stuff.<br/><br/>edit: Oh yeah, spells! They are pretty much the same as equipment, except the game never tells you how to use a small hammer or a mirror.<br/><br/><b>Wandering Monsters!</b> The DM rolls to see what kind of monster shows up. These lists, much like Vincent Baker's lists, are descriptions of the setting. These are the kinds of monsters that exist in whatever particular setting, but instead of a person, the dice to the picking.<br/><br/><b>Treasure Tables!</b> After you get past the monsters, the DM rolls up treasure. This is pretty much the same as wandering monster tables. Where certain locations have different lists of possible monsters, most monsters have different lists of possible treasure.<br/><br/>The principle is pretty much the same though. Somebody writes down a bunch of setting details before play, then the DM or MC deploys those setting details during play. Whether you just pick at the time or roll dice to pick from a list depends on the game, and what you want to use the lists for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303971/#Comment_303971" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-11T00:55:06+00:00" title="December 11, 2010 12:55AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2010 12:57AM by Simon_C.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some things I like about lists:<br/><br/>- You can use them to display a range of choices clearly<br/>- Giving people concrete choices rather than free reign can make the choices easier<br/>- You can use lists of options to convey setting and tone<br/>- Sometimes you think it will be hard to list all the possible things, but then you try and it isn't<br/>- Lists can make really clever points quickly.

I think it keeps a lot of the strengths of lists Simon mentioned (conveys tone/clever ideas briefly, makes choices easier, helps the list creator figure out what his game is about in that category, et cetera) while explicitly allowing for more creative input from the list chooser.<br/><br/>On the other hand, as the oracles from In a Wicked Age and some other list-like game elements have shown, sometimes being constrained to "just these! no others!" is creatively stimulating and fun (I mean, that's the whole reason these games have rules, after all). I think maybe it's related to the Czege prinicple - portions of your decision making/imaginary space/whatever are out of your hands, and that adds an element of interest that you don't get from just making up everything in a given situation yourself.<br/><br/><b>edited to fix grammatical error</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304017/#Comment_304017" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-11T17:43:45+00:00" title="December 11, 2010  5:43PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Umberto Eco, an italian scholar and historian who is also one of the world's most renowned semioticists, just published something like that... the italian title is "Vertigine della Lista", which means Vertigo of lists, and it examines the way that lists were used in literature ("either to convey the finite, or to suggest the infinite", or something like that).

I totally want to try making that game, Alberto.<br/><br/>One of the things about lists for me, now, is that I'm almost more attached to the nature of lists than I am to open options. This isn't entirely true, but I do very much think that there's an element of the Czege Principle going on here. I do very much think that choosing from a list feels so much more evocative than coming up with something on the fly. Could just be the mode I'm in right now, but at the moment I'm far less enamored with Fate's ability to make up aspects right now, than I am with lists and the ability to allow for the creation of unique story and character even though everyone gets the same exact friggin' lists. <br/><br/>As for the finite/infinite element of lists, I think that one of the most interesting things AW does is condense options into specific, clear lists, which then dictate exactly the style of play that can proceed. You can never "Just Kill A Guy;" that's not a move on the list. Instead, you have to Go Aggro or Seize By Force. Those lists very much control the way that the game functions, and in a good way, too, because now I have the kind of codified definitions of the world that were talked about in that interview. I know how to look at the world and see, "Okay, I can fit a Go Aggro in here." Same with HWCTLH, where I can see "I can fit a sin in here." The finite nature of the lists puts a constraint on how the world can be perceived in the game, which ultimately makes a tighter game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_304552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304552/#Comment_304552" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T09:22:15+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:22AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am fascinate by a quote at the end of that Umberto Eco interview.<br/><br/>"If you interact with things in your life, everything is constantly changing. And if nothing changes, you're an idiot."<br/><br/>I have lived my life in perfect accordance with the sentiment of that quote, and I am now a person that I would never have guessed that I would be. I think that this is actually the real appeal of RPGs for me. Where will the story go? We will not know until we kill out babies. (metiphorically ;-) ) It is also the appeal of the GMless game. Giving up the need for any real "control" allows for real genius to emerge. Lists can be a powerful tool for these types of games, especially if the list is constantly changing. I have been trying to design a game that mechanizes the idea of an evolving list. It is proving to be an interesting endeavor. Being an amature with no time and a mercurial attention, I think that I am literally on about version number 6 or 7.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_304555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/304555/#Comment_304555" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-15T09:31:20+00:00" title="December 15, 2010  9:31AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2010 9:33AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ability scores and skills are lists, too.
