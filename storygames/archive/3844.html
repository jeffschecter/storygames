I am not one of those movie reviewers that is trying to be mean cause it brings ratings or any such non-sense and certainly not because I want to hurt anyone's feelings but because, unlike normal criticism, is actually helps a lot of people.  <br/><br/>It helps sell books: bad reviews are good publicity and I write my reviews to say "I didn't like this and why but you might."  Not to say every game is a gem but i bring to the table the good and the bad and someone out there likes this game.<br/><br/>It helps others make informed decisions.  The market will bear out the rest.<br/><br/>It helps designers target me and all that dig what I dig.  Since my reviews are all based on play and my comments include a group of people's perspective on play then I think it would be useful to bring concerns to the table.  I was really happy that my comments, although not taken wholesale (which is grand) were addressed by gregor's rerelease of Best Friends.  I'm going to play again and do an undate post GenCon including the new information.<br/><br/>Now, let me first say that there are very few games I actually regret buying (and I buy a lot).  I have literally over a thousand traditional RPGs that go unused on my bookshelf.  I read them and absorbed them into the gaming brain to bring out when useful.  The only time I regret buying them is when I see there was something else I bought later that I could have used.<br/><br/>Here is an example: There is ONE book I returned to the store from I bought it from in exchange for another game.  years and years ago I bought Immortal.  I read it cover to cover and thought "what crap!" and returned it for Legacy (a Highlander wannabe).  They tried to rename everything in gaming while retaining all the same shit - hit points were called one thing and AC was called something else obscure and hoity-toity.   When I was done I knew very little about the game.<br/><br/>A few years later a buddy of mine bought the abridged version with all the language cleaned up and said "gee, this game is pretty cool."  I read it and rebought the game now that I understood what was going on.<br/><br/>So far I have not come across an indy game I didn't like on some level.  I have bought games that weren't my style and games that didn't do what I needed them to do but none I could say I regretted buying.<br/><br/>That being said and by no means meant to just be reactionary but I honestly did not like Donjon and in retrospect, Sorcerer.  I don't like the die mechanic.  I produced some unsatisfying results.  First Donjon, to me, is hard to figure out if it's completely tongue-in-cheek or can be played in a fun but serious tone.  I had no luck the two times I ran it.  I liked the ideas there but not the die mechanic.  In Donjon there were too many rolls and those rolls were too random.  Additionally what I really wanted was a cool dungeon SIM game where the game was more about the dungeons than about the characters.  <br/><br/>I will quote Fred "Calling Dictionary of Mu a Sorcerer supplement is like calling the Sistine Chapel a supplement to the Bible."  We played it three times and it fell flat every time.  The stories we told and our plans and inclusions in the Dictionary rocked but that was almost always despite the rolls not because of them.  I have heard it said that Sorcerer is incomplete without the other Sorcerer books but to be honest I am not interested in that sort of buy in when I have so many games that do stand on their own and Mu would make an excellent port for them.<br/><br/>I know thousands of people have enjoyed Sorcerer and that mechanic but my experiences have not been among them.  This is a situation that I don't think Ron needs to do anything about nor can I say I am playing it "right" but it's been my experience, none-the-less.<br/><br/>So what Indie/Story Games have you regretted buying, would rather use something else (other than your game), or would just give the designer a bit of advice that would otherwise make it better for YOU.<br/><br/>My AP Review of the first part of <b>Hero's Banner </b>should be up this week and the second part will be up after GenCon.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>- Don                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86223/#Comment_86223" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T13:35:29+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  1:35PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            intro: after don's well worded piece i'm going to sound like a barbarian. here i go.<br/><br/><br/>game i regret buying:<br/><br/><b>Faery's Tale</b>. i feel like i've seen this a dozen times before. pick a class. choose from lists. i hate this format. i don't want to play this with kids; i want to play games with kids wherein they tell me (if i'm facilitating) what they are and what they can do and then i balance the group out power-wise by trimming or fluffing and then we throw down. too many numbers (for kids), too much like changeling with the "are you this, or this? one or the other."<br/>hey, and what the fuck is up with the brownies? so, pixies: adorable flying things with pixie dust. oh, i guess girls are supposed to play pixies. sprites: little knights with thorn swords who ride bees. oh, i guess boys are supposed to play sprites. pooka: can transform into animals. i guess the queer kids are supposed to play pooka, as that these faeries are ugly, change form, and are loners. so, sign up for your gender roles early, kids.<br/>brownies: their powers are to clean up around the house and be invisible. oh, like wives. fuck off.<br/>abilities seem skewed and most aren't too interesting. instead of cool magical stuff, it's all like "brave" or "fortunate" or "lucky". yeah, that's right. also, while the good/evil thing i guess makes sense when it comes to source material (fairy stuff, not to be confused with fairy tales) it's still hella boring and teaches kids that people do things "for evil"... like, as if "evil" existed and was something that ANYONE actually strove toward. Disney doesn't need your help in the disinformation department.<br/>also Expend Hp To Do Magic Stuff is boring. (edit: for kids. can be awesome otherwise, except if point of game is to do magic stuff, then is at cross purposes to "fun")<br/>Narrator judges when you get to rejuvinate your hp/magic meter is boring.<br/><br/>all that being said, the art is totally gorgeous, and i'm totally going to play it when i can find folks who want to twist shit around and have crazy (imaginary, but i'm open) faery sex and deal with corruption and loss and expenditure of life force for "magic", which is to say "manifestation of beauty in a dark world". and lots of faery death. shallow little graves.<br/><br/>if this makes me an asshole, it's better that you know now. i don't know Patrick, Sandy, Christina, or Robin; i hope they are happy with their game and i'll tell them that i don't have a ongoing gaming group, they or anyone else are welcomed to make snide remarks as to why this might be or to call into question how active my sex life is.<br/><br/>// <br/><br/>what would make this game good for me: well, i like faeries. if there were some ideas about different kinds of faeries that were non-exclusive... crap, i just wrote and have deleted a list to choose from. there's two directions here - the little kid direction, and the adult gamer direction. instead of making an introductory trad-feeling game, i'd like to see a more free-formy kind of game which wouldn't have kids picking up pencils to cross off essence scores, or looking at character sheets to know what abilities ("gifts") they had. <br/><br/>you know, this is hard to do without describing a game in particular that i am making. <br/><br/>i guess there's not really that much i like about it. now on, i'll read reviews before buying things.<br/><br/>thanks for reading.<br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86230/#Comment_86230" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T13:48:45+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  1:48PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shock:, but only because I bought 1.0 without knowing a) it's not really playable without additional materials (freely available online, yes) and b) 1.1 was coming out almost immediately.

I can name the ones that I bought, peeked at, went "Nope!" and turned right around on RPGNet Sales, but I was able to pick out a little something cool each time.<br/><br/>In return, though, I can name a game I regret selling: <b>CONTINUUM</b>. I have bought this game THREE TIMES.<br/><br/>The first time, I read it, thought the background was awesome, found the game unplayable. When I returned to the US and started selling all my games to clean out my junk and pay for rent (before I ended up finding awesome work), it got sold. I mean, why not? I wasn't going to run it again.<br/><br/>Later on, I felt nostalgic for it. Bought it on eBay for like $10. Read through the cool background section again. Because the background sections were like 100ccs of pure awesome in the brain. But then in a later culling I sold it again.<br/><br/>I bought it last year for the Third and Final Time on eBay. It now sits on my shelf in its respectable position next to Blue Planet, the other game that I will never play but proudly own and read. The background and ideas that Continuum spawned were worth reading, and every once in a while I go through the alternative history of the world section when I want some ideas.<br/><br/>I have Playstation games I regret buying, though. <b>Killer 7</b>. What the fuck?  I got it in a bargain bin for $5.00, and I sold it later for $5.00, and yet I still feel like I lost out on the deal somehow because of the 20 minutes I spent playing it. <b>The Kangfu</b> (part of Japan's "Simple 2000 Series"): They took Kung Fu, mixed it with a storyline using real Cantonese voiceovers, and set it in this classic Shaw Brothers style game. And yet, the game wasn't complete for them without making sure It Sucked. You only had two attacks: Punch and Kick; WTF, is this NES?? They took Cantonese Kung Fu/Shaw Brothers, and drained it of all its fun and action. Again, I sold it, net loss of about $5, but I totally regret that purchase. <b>SIREN aka FORBIDDEN SIREN</b> I regret that it was too hard that even Mensa said "fuck you". The second one (Forbidden Siren 2) is perhaps one of my favorite games, and probably one of the best three horror video games ever made. But the first was as fun as sitting naked on broken glass, but you couldn't tell that until after about a day or two of playing.<br/><br/>Oh, shit, I think I thought of one: GURPS 4th (characters book). After all the work that we put into deciding that this was the system that we were going to use for a campaign run by one of my gaming group members, that campaign never took off. Part of the reason? Rules sucked the life out of us.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86291/#Comment_86291" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T16:05:24+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  4:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Shock:, but only because I bought 1.0 without knowing a) it's not really playable without additional materials (freely available online, yes) and b) 1.1 was coming out almost immediately.

Out of the many books I regret the most? Almost anything related to Asian campaigns. Yeah, it feels real to notice that most of <acronym title="old world of darkness">oWoD</acronym> Asia resembles really bad Wapananime, complete with bad the amateur-grade illustrations (one exception would have been the Nagah splatbook, which managed to be from White Wolf, be cool and be about a fictional Asia).<br/><br/>Heck, while I'm at it, my main regret for <cite>Mage</cite> was, despite its awesome concept, was that it would have been  really hard to play, much less teach to other people. So much for an easy entry into roleplaying...<br/><br/>Mind you, I'll never regret buying <cite>the Infinite Tapestry</cite> and parts of the <cite>Mage Storyteller's Guide</cite> (or something, I can't remember\u2014 there were two Mage Storyteller's Somethings, and I'm talking about the hardcover one, not the floppy softcover one, although that was cool as well). The former because it was full of awesome and the latter for the Biscocchian Co-Prosperity Sphere. One day this will get run, Storyteller System or no.

Like they steal babies and replace them with dopplegangers. Or, if you come upon a fairy circle they play music that makes you dance until you die. Or, Oberon and his wild hunt, which drives everything before it lest they be slain. Or, you wander off into fairy and when you come back 10 years have passed.

I have bought games that weren't as cool as I thought they would be (for example, the Amber diceless game) but I got them for a good enough price that I don't regret having them.<br/><br/>I don't regret buying Shock and even played it just fine at Go Play NW, though I am looking forward to the update.<br/><br/>--Dan</blockquote>\nOh, we played Shock: ok--it's just that it was because of having done a demo, and thus picked up most of the missing bits, at GenCon, rather than because it was in the book.<br/><br/>Still, Shock: is definitely on my regrets list. I definitely wouldn't've bought it if i'd skimmed it to decide, rather than gotten a demo to decide. And it's not the missing rules bits (like setting the fulcra) that was the real problem--those are elements i could've improvised, even if i hadn't known them due to the playtest. It's that i have no idea how to get a story like the one in the intro from rules like those in Shock:. <br/><br/>And now i'm wishing i'd polished up my comments an why it disappointed me, and gotten them to Joshua before v1.1 happened, so now i'll have to see if someone else had the same problems, and they are therefore fixed. Shock: v1.1 happened much quicker than i'd expected, and totally snuck up on me. Well, if not, maybe there'll be a v1.2 some day.<br/><br/>Oh, and, strictly speaking, i don't regret buying GURPS Basic Set 3rd edition. But it is the only other game that i've paid too much for--i knew before i bought it that it wasn't worth to me what it cost. But i wanted it for reference, and when i saw a used copy at $6, i couldn't pass it up.<br/><br/>A smidge of regret for the few times i accidentally re-bought a game. But, with the exception of ShadowRun 3rd, I've simply given all those to a friend, and he does the same for me when he somehow acquires a  duplicate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86409/#Comment_86409" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T04:24:06+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  4:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 4:29AM by Lord_Minx.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay, cool thread. ^_^<br/><br/>Some games I regret buying (And plan to sell soon.):<br/><br/>- <b>The Bargains:</b><br/>One of the gaming stores in my area has a bargain bin with all hardcovers in there for 10 Euros and all softcovers for 5. Over the last few years I bought a few games there, and while some have been prety nice, I actually, kinda regret most of the to some degree. <br/><br/>The worst offender here is defenitly "Children of the Sun", a game that sounded awesome but ended up being really, really REALLY bad. Like, "The world looks like a vagina and the races seem like they are designed by and for furries" bad. It reads like somebody slapped two completly different game books together, the first half sounds like-your-typical-fantasy-game (Argh, dozens of pages of nothing but history. BORING history. No explanation of what this game is actually ABOUT,...), while the latter half reads like a bad cyberpunk/modern game. I still haven't found how teh two are really connected, the name-giving "Children of the Sun" aren't mentioned either and for a game that calls its genre "Diesel Punk" there's a strangely complete lack of Diesel. (Or any other modern technology. All the tech is "Arcanotech"...)<br/><br/>Another bargain game I regret buying is "Blue Planet". It had/has many fans of RPGnet and I like SciFi, but I was still disappointed. I was hoping or something, I don't know, more like Seaquest or THS and got something that, while not really BAD, was pretty uninspiring. Like, it's got potential, it could be as cool as THS or Ex Machina, but just doesn't cut it. Where CotS makes me want to throw it away in rage or ritually murder the authors, Blue Planet just makes me sigh sadly. A shame...<br/><br/>Another game I'd hoped would be <b>so cool</b> but that was disappointing was the "Metabarons" RPG. I love the Metabarons and Incal comics, I love the setting and I was hoping to get a game that supported the wierd, mythical, cool-stuff-turned-to-11 feel of the comic and instead I got boring setting info (the small bits of setting info there were...) and a luke-warm rehash of the Star Wars d6 rules. *sigh* Can't stop thinking about what his game could have been. But even with the heart-breaking and the tears, this is a borderline case of "Games I regret". While I'm thinking about selling it or trading it for other stuff, there's also stuff in there that isn't half bad, like the starship rules. Still, lots of wasted potential in there...<br/><br/>And the last two of the bargains-I-regret are "Everstone" and "Dreaming Cities". I group those together because they are, in my mind at least, related through both using some Tri-Stat variant and both being ultimately "meh". No big hate here, it's just that, for those 20 Euros, I think I could/should have gotten something I enjoy more...<br/><br/>- <b>The Indies:</b><br/>There are two Indie games I kinda-sorta regret buying to some degree (Vague languange used to indicate internal conflict and not to cushion my opinion.), and those are "Shock:Social Science Fiction" and "Lacuna Part 1" Second Edition.<br/><br/>The problem I have with Shock seem to be the same other people have with it: I still haven't figured it out. No idea how this thing is supposed to work. Joshua was nice enough to offer us 1.0 owners free pdfs of 1.1 and these might make it easier, but so far, after reading the first half, it hasn't, really. Might change in the future, but, well...<br/><br/>As for Lacuna, the poblem is a bit similar. I love how the book is made up, the art, the design, ... I LOVE the setting/idea/mood of the city, of hunting rogue personalities and infiltrating the collective mind and I love the various ideas behind the mechanics, static and so on. But so far, I can't think how to actually run this. Not sure where the problem realy lies, but the game has left me thinking "Wow, awesome, I wanna do this!!! But, well, how?".<br/><br/>Both of these games are borderline cases, like the "Metabarons" RPG: They have interesting stuff in them that makes me thing I might do something with or "get" them in the future, but the problems I have with them are enough to nag and annoy me, to make me think grumpy thoughts about other things I could have done with the money or time. But like I mentioned in the beginning, there's a real conflict here...<br/><br/>Well, I hope any authors (or fans) of these games won't start jumping off bridges over these, but then I don't really expect them to. ^_^<br/><br/>M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86411/#Comment_86411" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T04:28:42+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  4:28AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 6:29AM by Andy.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>jake, how did you not tell me that story? that is so amazing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Jake, I do hope you're kidding, really I do. </blockquote>\nNot kidding at all.

I found an enthusiastic home for it, though, so I count it a partial victory.<br/><b>Lacuna</b>: It's beautiful (though the chaotic internal borders start to inhibit the actual text, which is not so pretty) but it doesn't seem to actually do anything interesting or fun.  Might have been a cooler systemless setting.  As it is it wasn't too fun to read and it won't get played here.  On the other hand it was less than twenty bucks so I'm not exactly seething with anger and regret.  I can always frame the cover.<br/><b>Deliria</b>: Again, pretty, but far too huge a fiction:system ratio.  And then the system isn't terribly interesting.  The overall theme of the game is unlikely to find an enthusiastic audience at the table here, so there's nothing to salvage.<br/><b>Nobilis</b>:  To be fair, I don't regret buying this, but it did fail.  It is beautiful and it was a delight to read and it gave me all kinds of inspiration for other things I have been working on.  I love it.  But it's not going to get played around my table and it's not going to get re-read so I found a home for it, too, where it will be played.  That's a kind of success story as far as I'm concerned but as a game it failed for me.<br/><br/>I just got my <b>Shock:</b> 1.0 in the mail and read it last night and I am not disappointed.  Of course, any downside to the purchase is mitigated by the fact that it's also a pre-order for 1.1.  I grew up with really half-assed photo-copied or even mimeographed indie games in the 70s, though, and this is nothing like as incomplete as some of the stuff that we found playable.  There are some missing elements to be sure, but nothing an experienced gamer can't piece together adequately -- that may make it fail as a game (generally) by limiting its audience, but it doesn't look like a failure for my group in particular.  I'm looking forward to seeing 1.1 but I'm also a little concerned -- there's a lot of really cool stuff in there that I would hate to see filed off to satisfy critics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Firefly%20Games" title="Firefly Games"><img alt="Firefly Games" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Firefly%20Games">Firefly Games</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86482/#Comment_86482" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T08:34:40+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  8:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 8:35AM by Firefly Games.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue&gt;The part that seems to be missing is the dark side of faeries.

Wicked acts earn a faery Dark Essence, which slowly corrupts her Essence, or magical life force. When your faery's starting Essence pool has been turned to Dark Essence, she become a dark faery - either a fallen fey, like a redcap if she is a sprite, if some kernel of goodness remains, or a goblin if she freely gives her heart to evil. (Fallen fey are a twisted version of their former selves, while goblins take new forms &amp; new Gifts). Dark faeries, even goblins, can regain their true selves by strength of character &amp; acts of heroism, replacing Dark Essence with pure Essence until they are redeemed. Faery circles and redcaps are in the core book. We're doing 1-page Faery Lore sheets as expansions, and while we don't have the Wild Hunt or changelings yet (though I do have an adventure on the way based on a stolen baby &amp; changeling), they are likely topics for future Faery Lore sheets.<br/><br/>I hope that clears up a few questions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86485/#Comment_86485" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T08:52:08+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  8:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though the sting has gone away from my initial realization, I sort of regret buying The Riddle of Steel.<br/><br/>It has some neat ideas and the combat system is very cool, but the "traditional" GM advice in the back felt like a slap in the face with its idea of the totalitarian, ass-kicking, illusionist story-author.  Also, the combat mechanic, one of the main selling points of the game, assumes that everybody knows exactly what armor looks like and what parts of the body it covers.  I know that if I started playing this and the GM told me that I got stabbed in the neck, despite wearing armor and a helmet, and with no warning that the armor coverage was "up to interpretation", I'd be pissed.

The clan/tribe/tradition/guild books reinforced rather than integrated those different playstyles and caused unnecessary player friction rather than awesome character friction.<br/><br/>Plus, for the money I spent, I could've single-handedly fed an indie game developer for a month. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86518/#Comment_86518" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T09:57:28+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  9:57AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought a lot of <b>Mage</b> books, despite having only played the game maybe 4 times.

Actually, a few years ago I was starting to regret my purchasing habits. Some of the biggest offenders:<br/>\n<br/>\n- D20, I have several boxes of D20 books. I don't regret the core 3.5 books, or Arcana Unearthed/Evolved and supplements, but I regret most anything else I've purchased (other than modules).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Seventh Sea. I bought just about everything. Because I kind of enjoyed a demo.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Deadlands. The game concept was cool, and perhaps if I had stuck to just the core book it would have been ok, except, no matter how much I want to love a Wild West game, I have yet to figure out how to turn it into a playable RPG (ok, so Dogs in the Vinyard is the shining exception).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Loads of SF games, especially after it became obvious I wasn't likely to play SF again anytime soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I sort of regret some of the later Glorantha material I purchased. I regretted buying some of the earlier material and sort of resolved never again (which is what fueled both the 7th Sea and Deadlands purchases). I should have stuck to just the RuneQuest material and skipped the Hero Wars/Quest material.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe good thing is that I have learned to be much more selective in my purchasing. I look at a book and ask how I will use it. I've bought a lot of games for cool settings, but the reality is that using an encyclopedic setting is difficult (even my favorite RQ/Glorantha campaign did it's best without reliance on much more than the rule book and Cults of Prax - though the map from Trollpack was very inspiring), and many simpler settings just don't have much appeal (often because they are just too simplistic).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a while, I could probably have justified some purchases just on the idea of broadening my horizons and giving me ideas. But long ago it became impossible to keep up, and most things I've purchased have never even been read, some not even had the cover's cracked (possibly not even in the store for things like some of the 7th Sea and Deadlands stuff). Back, say around 1980, when I was actually trying to play some of the multitude of games I was purchasing, we joked that I was buying practically everything that came out, even then, I couldn't buy everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86562/#Comment_86562" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T11:45:05+00:00" title="August  8, 2007 11:45AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Fading Suns</b> and <b>Fading Suns D20</b>.

I read a lot of online stuff alluding to Sorcerer being jam-packed with wicked-cool techniques and then opened up the book to find out that part constituted a very minor portion of the actual text. The juicy new-wave/indie/story-game goodness wasn't as bright and colorful as I thought it would be, and you had a lot of stuff that looked like pretty traditional game mechanics (including some odd statistical relationships). Basically, much like Eruditus looked at Mu and thought "hey, this would be sweeter with another system," I totally felt that way about Sorcerer itself.<br><br>Speaking of advice, another game that gives me pause is Lacuna Part 1 (2nd Attempt). It's really, really, really cool. But, well, I feel like the Internet talk about it says more than the actual book does. I pick up this thing, read through it carefully, get confused, and just kind of shrug -- I can't isolate the key stuff. Honestly, I need a book that lays it all out on the table, with phrases like "Say yes or roll the dice" and "Use pool refreshment like a rock star." Not having that part was really messing me up and made me very unsure of what would happen if I just picked up the book and muddled through. I feel like I'll have to do a lot of work before I can play it. Not a bad buy, but I'd really rather have shelled out some more cash for something that was less artful but included more guidance as to what to do with it.<br><br>And, speaking of the part that I wanted only being a small part of the actual book (as Sorcerer, above): the Riddle of Steel. The good parts of the game are really underdeveloped in the core book. Through shipping weirdness, I managed to get The Flower of Battle, the weapons and fighting supplement, before the core book, and that greatly inflated my expectations as to what kinds of stuff I would find in the main tome, since I figured there'd be pages and pages about historical fighting styles, the nuances of different weapons, and generally well-explained mechanics. The TROS main book's actual section on combat is pretty short and leaves a lot of nuances completely unexplained, the weapons are kinda generic and have barely any text associated with their entries, and the Spiritual Attributes were sprinkled around strangely in the other stuff -- it felt more like reading someone's notebook than a finished game. All in all, TROS ended up feeling like bits of "fantasy heartbreaker" around a juicy kernel of fighting-ness.<br><br>I also totally regret buying 95% of the D&amp;D (3rd) books I've ever held in my hands, in retrospect. I spent like three years just having that game get more and more and more frustrating every time I touched it.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86840/#Comment_86840" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T02:18:39+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  2:18AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 2:18AM by Andrew Kenrick.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>The worst offender here is defenitly "Children of the Sun", a game that sounded awesome but ended up being really, really REALLY bad.</blockquote>\nThank goodness I'm not the only one there.
