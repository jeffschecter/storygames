I never feel like these apply to me. I don't dress up. I don't consider myself very "mainstream," but I don't feel like an outcast in my daily life, either. And I don't game because I want to escape from reality or "become someone else." I game because: RPGs tickle something in my brain, I love the genres upon which they tend to focus, and because the "group story process" fascinates me.<br/><br/>I'd love to see an RPG documentary/report/whatever that actually represented the kind of people I game with 99% of the time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92917/#Comment_92917" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T07:41:26+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  7:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 7:42AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is tricky.  I saw that report yesterday morning and was surprised Slate had it.  Then I watched it and realized: <br/><br/>It's a crew with a camera looking for things that will look interesting on a camera.  People in costumes are visual.  Four people sitting around talking till the conflict is found and then playing some cards are not.<br/><br/>It's one of the sins of TV news.  You go with the story with the picture, whether it's more important than another story or not.<br/><br/>And, of course, the people who wear the costumes and whatnot -- the ones interviewed because they are interesting to the camera -- do have a point of view about why they do that.<br/><br/>I, too, would have liked to see the story you want to see, Mark.  I'm just wondering, since the narration and action in the kind of game we're talking about are not cinematic in any way, and often not very presentational but more muted, WHAT would actually come off on a camera.  It sounds kind of dull visually.  I could see, however, a <i>This American Life </i>style radio documentary -- edited and with odd bits of music added in -- conveying some of it.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92920/#Comment_92920" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T07:45:01+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  7:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me, too, Buzz.

It doesn't have to be big explosions and fursuits to get people interested in something, just... visual stereotypes.<br/><br/>She's probably a more interesting candidate to interview than a gamer who's all normal-looking and well-balanced, even if the former consists of maybe 10% of the community.

Especially if you want to try and decouple this kind of gaming from videogames.<br/><br/>Consider comic books. For a long time the only articles you'd see were variations on "Bang! Zoom! Comics Are Big Business," and then maybe in the last 10 years, there's been a switch to "Bang! Zoom! Comics Aren't Just For Kids Anymore" thanks to cross-over writers like Neil Gaiman, Maus being taught in schools and universities, and of course the recent comic-based summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>While we should always push for better coverage, and take opportunities to foster it, the fact that we're here at all is still news to a lot of people. We're going to see a lot of "Did You Know People Play Games?" articles before we get to "Gamers Are Just Like You And Me," and maybe, if the stars align properly, "Why Aren't You Gaming Yet?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93330/#Comment_93330" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T23:16:16+00:00" title="September  5, 2007 11:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.
