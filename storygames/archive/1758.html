                    Does anyone have experience sitting down with non game designers and introducing them to design? Can you share your experiences?<br/><br/>Last week I met an artist who wants a game designed. He makes home-made art coins that come from a fantasy setting that has arisen out of his art. The setting isn't a hearbreaker or Tolkein clone. It sounds quite interesting. He wants some kind of gaming experience that revolves around these coins. I'm absolutely certain that he can benefit from exposure to indie gaming ideas, but he probably also has illusions or preconceptions that need to be exploded.<br/><br/>I've written up a short agenda for our meeting, but I'm sory of going in blind. How would you approach this kind of a discussion?                </div>

                            Stay away from theory and jargon completely.<br/><br/>Talk to him about what the game might be like when you play it. When someone plays this game, what do they do and say? Why is that fun? That's what game design is. No need to muddy the waters with anything else at first, in my opinion.                        </div>

<p>Yeah, I think John's right. Give him answers when he wants them, but otherwise, just do the basic, "What's the game about? What do the rules encourage the players to do? How does your game support that?" schtick.</p>
<p>My guess is, there's stuff in this world that he's created that has to do with something abstract he's into. Politics, violent combat, exploration of high mountains, whatever. Make the game about that stuff.</p>
<p>Is there a pic of these coins around somewhere?</p>

                            You say he wants the experience to revolve around the coins - the physical reality of the could be easily exploited, for nstance by flipping them or using them as markers or tokens. He'll probably think you're the best thing since masking fluid if you can get the coins themselves in on it. And flipping coins is an easy-to-comprehend resolution system, since its one which is applied to real life pretty often.                        </div>

                            Hey Tony,<br/><br/>I'm on the margins of a similar situation. Danielle and I met a comic artist this past weekend. It turns out he's had some success with his comics, and now he's looking at the possibility of a roleplaying game. The particular challenge here is that he's friends with another comics guy who published a game about his own comics, and so he's inclined to trust this other comics guy more than the designer he's been working with. The other guy's game is a big setting with traditional mechanics, and so that's what this guy is trying to pull from his designer. Because the other comics guy is a close friend, it's hard to tell this guy that no one plays the other guy's game.<br/><br/>So the message to this guy has to be that what he needs is a game that people who read his comics would like, not a tool to get gamers into his comics. People who read his comics is the relevant audience. And then the guy has to make a decision about whether the gameplay experience his readers might best appreciate is more like his authoring activity than like the comic reading activity. Except he doesn't even have a frame of reference for making that decision.<br/><br/>So my prescription here, and for your artist guy, would be an actual play experience. Minimally it would provide a frame of reference for the authoring/reading decision. And hopefully the creative result will give serious credibility to the collaboration/authoring option. (One hurdle specific to these guys is convincing them to trust players to understand the thematic juice of their settings, to trust them to be authors. Do you remember R.H. Junior bombing on to The Forge a few years ago looking for advice on creating a roleplaying game from his Tales of the Questor webcomic, only to fiercly resist anything but an authoritative world and mechanics that restricted players to control over character actions only?) I have to believe that what when the option is tested and the trust bears creative fruit an artist is going to understand and feel the thrill of collaborative creativity inspired by his art and want that for his game.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            Great post, Paul.<br/><br/>I imagine it can be hard to convince people that they want something that basically generates fanfic instead of, say, the equivilent of those crappy video game adaptations of comic books that may be okay games, but don't really resemble the comics.  Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_computer_and_video_games#NES_version" rel="nofollow">Batman</a> (1989).                        </div>

                            The trick is that you have to make the artist's coins, not just any coin or other substitute, central to and necessary for play...<br><br>(a la Bacchanal, or, to a lesser extent, nearly any miniatures game)                        </br></br></div>

                            Thanks guys! Do to a twist of fate, I did not get to read any of these responses before meeting the artist, but I think they're going to be very helpful going forward.<br><br>So here's what happened. I basically pulled together a bunch of questions to ask in order to get a feel for where we would go.<br><br>What are you financial goals for this game?<br>- What kind of financial return are you looking for (from "I'd do this for free" to "I want to become rich")?<br/>- What are you feelings on various distribution channels (online, POD, on the shelf in game stores, etc.)?<br/><br/>This discussion helped to set expectations and avoid obvious pitfalls like "I want to get rich selling my D20 supplement in game stores".<br/><br/>What resources do you have to bring to bear including:<br/>- time<br/>- money<br/>- artistic collatoral you've already created<br/><br/>When you talk about money, it immediately focuses the discussion on practicalities. I like practicalities.<br/><br/>What are you design goals for this game?<br/>- What tone do you want to have?<br/>- What kind of agenda interests you (with a two minute intro to GNS)?<br/>- What kind of stories do you want to tell?<br/><br/>The agenda discussion was very interesting. As John might have predicted, the terminology didn't light up the room. However, once we got to talking about different kinds of games without using the terms, we made some real progress. We talked about MUSHing, and his negative experiences of what it means to try to "role-play" in an environment that doesn't foster it. This conversation really clicked. It turned out to be important to make the point that at this point we're not deciding "what kind of game are we going to make", but just learning to understand what some of the options are. <br/><br/>At the end of this discussion we basically reached a point where he conveyed to me some kernel of the experience he wanted out of the game, and I was able to say "OK, my job is going to be to try and come up with some mechanics that support that."<br/><br/>We didn't come anywhere near to coming up with a game, but we did reach some important milestones. I was able to see that he had realistic goals, and he was able to see (I hope) that I had some ideas and background that might enable me to write a game he'll like. Our next step is for me to come up with an outline and sit down with him and see what he thinks.<br/><br/>Paul: good idea with the actual play. Luckily the guy isn't a total outsider to RPGs. I think I can sit him down with something and see what clicks.<br/><br/>As for the coins... I WISH I could post a picture. The artist wants to keep his ideas close to his chest, but suffice to say they are pretty damn cool. I don't know if I can come up with the right design, but tossing these babies around the table is going to be fun.<br/><br/>And Sempiternity, thanks for mentioning Bacchanal, I'd totally forgotten abou it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>The dude owns copyright on his coins. Keeping them close to his chest just means he's going to get less help than he could get otherwise.</p>
<p>I've yet to see an idea stolen in this community. It's not the idea that sells. It's the implementation.</p>

                            Yeah, I understand. It's not the coins. You can buy them in a couple of places here in Seattle. It's rather that he's been burned by companies in the past (he's an inventory and is no stranger to patent struggles) and doesn't want his ideas in the wild. I'm sure he wouldn't mind sharing them, it's just that it's his decision to make, not mine.                        </div>
