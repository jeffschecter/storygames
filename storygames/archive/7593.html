All you'd need is a strong character-driven story-line to link your combat scenes (and that should be easy to get from the kind of source material the Wushu games are based on).<br/><br/>3:16 because it already has a built-in storyline, as well as well-defined combat scenarios (defined abstractly and just needing description to bring them to life). And, of course, the characters' military roles are already very well defined. All that is needed are some personal goals for the characters.<br/><br/>Maid because it has mechanisms for creating all the main characters, their primary goal is part of the setting, and it includes a number of well-defined scenarios. All that is needed is a way to generate define the opponents and combats in detail.<br/><br/>Has anyone else done much along these lines?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168435/#Comment_168435" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T02:29:39+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  2:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've fiddled with solo games now and then in different contexts.

You get a packaged interactive experience rather than a system.<br/><br/>Could you do the same with some sort of randomized system, where your input is formalized and then reacted too? I think yes, indeed most computer AIs are doing exactly this when they supply opposition in games.

There are times when I am making decisions essentially in-character as my protagonist, but also times when the Mythic GME has me using logic to interpret it's random input, which is GM-like thinking.  <br/><br/>@ David, specifically:  One of the solo games I'm doing with <i>Mythic</i> has drifted into a kind of 'GM mode', in that I have become as interested in the events and story surrounding a character that was originally just a throw-away NPC.  I promoted him to PC status, so I now have essentially two PCs, sometimes cooperating,  sometimes competing, and sometimes dealing with completely separate storylines.

It requires at least three people.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, this is totally relevant. In the last week or two, it's had two solo playtests! I ran through a whole game on my own, pretending I was three players (with different profiles and styles). It was more like work than like play for the most part, but there was a moment where I got really excited about the story and couldn't tear myself away. The intensity surprised me! And now I just found out that someone I don't know read the rules and played a whole game by himself. He had a good time, for what it's worth. I wonder if he used the same methods I did...<br/><br/>I know that for me, however, RPGs are all about interacting with friends--it's a social, personal process. So I've never tried to find a solo RPG. It doesn't sound that appealing. I mean, it would have to be REALLY exciting to be worthwhile, for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson" title="Chris Peterson"><img alt="Chris Peterson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cpeterso.com/html/img/merman-confounded.200x200.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Peterson">Chris Peterson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168703/#Comment_168703" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T12:38:28+00:00" title="September 12, 2008 12:38PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many of these solo systems involve a randomized GM.
