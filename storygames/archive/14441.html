Or fiction period. Or basically wants to engage in the game much. And whenever I see some dumping on the idea this always comes up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I was wondering, what the peeps here thought about that. At the wonderful Fabricated Realities, there were a bunch of people (Candy comes to mind) Who'd never played such games before and ADORED it. Is this sort of thing conditioned by certain playstyles? Do some people just sit around at a table to socialize a little with friends?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd really, above all, is this such a huge phenomenon it's actually a serious concern that should inform you at all times? I've NEVER encountered someone as opposed tp the sort of thing because they didn't want a creative role in anything? I mean, even people who want to be immersed (whatever that means to them) can't be opposed to their character actions being part of the fiction, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if this is half baked, I'm just grappling with this concept since it always feels off to me when it comes up.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328404/#Comment_328404" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T02:38:37+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  2:38AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's some truth in it, I think.

A game that is flexible about how and when everybody contributes is better from this point of view.</li><li>There is no problem if you don't have passive players in the group. For some people this is a completely unrealistic assumption, while others have never encountered a passive player.</li><li>Being passive is not necessarily a sign of a creative agenda conflict, but it can be. Sometimes people are just being passive because they like to engage less.</li><li>Just like a game being unable to handle passive players is not necessarily a problem, being a passive player is necessarily not one either. In Internet discussions some people will say stupid things about certain games because they don't handle passivity well, while others will say stupid things about some gaming groups because they don't understand that there are other reasons for passivity aside from a creative problem.</li></ul>\nThis usability issue has been pretty relevant to me lately, as I've been playing old school D&amp;D. That's probably the most passivity-resistant game there is in roleplaying, so I've been able to teach the game in a very effortless manner, and I've been able to accept a very wide range of people into it: anybody can sit in and roll the dice now and then as long as the core of the group keeps the game moving. Over time the passive guys will learn how the game works and join in on contributing, or they won't, and then they'll probably drop out over time. This is easier than the games that you outright can't play if the group includes even one non-hip player, as is often the case when you do an open call for players. Something like Sorcerer, say, will simply not work if there are players who can't contribute. Just the nature of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328410/#Comment_328410" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T03:47:31+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  3:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2011 3:47AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>A lot depends on the game, I think.</blockquote>\nYeah, and there's also a wide spectrum between players who are <i>entirely</i> passive about <i>everything</i> (which is, for some unfathomable reason, what these threads seem to assume is the case) and players who are up for total collaboration on everything.  Those all-or-nothing types are the extreme opposite ends of a long, long curve, many standard deviations away from the fat part in the middle where the rest of us live.<br/><br/>Real people tend to try to do the things they enjoy and avoid the things they don't.  In a game, that might mean that some will want to invent details about the setting and incorporate them in a scene, but won't want to determine the results of an investigation; or they want to have conversations with other characters, but don't want to frame the scenes in which those conversations take place; or they want to declare what happens when their characters win battles, but don't want to narrate what happens when their characters win or lose arguments with their families.  So many things can be done in a game that it's kind of ridiculous to think that it's at all normal for anyone to love or hate ALL of it: most of us are going to fall in the middle, and given our druthers we'll stick with what we like and hope that someone else likes to do the stuff we don't.  As Eero says, if the game is flexible about how and when everyone contributes to the game, it's easier for groups to work around the parts some players don't want to mess around with.<br/><br/>Really, I'd rather say that <i>players who are not having fun</i> are the ones who kill collaboration-heavy games, because it's closer to the truth.  A player who isn't into certain kinds of collaboration isn't a bad person or non-hip or stupid (well, not necessarily), they just aren't into it...and all of us have been that guy at some point.  It sucks, but it happens, and on another day or in another game we'll have a better time.  Figuring out what we like and dislike doing in games is a critical element to deciding whether we'll stick with this hobby in the first place, I think.<br/><br/>So saying that a game is passivity-resistant is just another way of saying that it's flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of preferences without wrecking everyone's fun.  If there's something that makes you miserable, you don't have to do it and your misery won't wreck everyone else's fun, too.  Games that require total, devoted, uncompromising collaboration between everyone to work aren't bad games, they're just games targeted for a very, very narrow audience (i.e, the people who enjoy doing all the things that game requires of them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328413/#Comment_328413" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T05:08:42+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  5:08AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently started a thread on how too much freedom can kill games. Basically some players are very intimidated by having to make too much up. If they are presented the world and told "Have at it!" They don't know what to do and their creativity dries up. If you describe a room and some people to them and ask "What happens next?" and they have a much easier time of it. D+D does the room description real well and gives definitive rules that show you what to do to what is in the room (basically beat it up and steal stuff). <br/><br/>If a game allows one or a few players to grand stand and take over the game then passive players can be run over. D+D is VERY vulnerable to this. The dominant player basically tells (their girl friend) when to roll the dice. Yes the passive player is carried along but if my only participation in a game is being asked "What do you do?" once every ten minutes or so - accompanied by a die roll (that I might not understand) - that isn't fun for me. <br/><br/>In the end though anti-story games threads are just turf pissing matches. D+D players often only play D+D. The RPGA gets whole rooms at Origins and Gen Con to do this. They don't have to rub shoulders with the rest of us. They aren't excluding us - we could play if we wanted to - but we don't. We self segregate. <br/><br/>Hey! I just noticed the change in the tag line for the site. Now we talk about roll play games rather than "Stabbing them in the hope with our ennui" A good move since I imagine most D+D players found that tag line off putting and archane.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328416/#Comment_328416" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T05:30:34+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  5:30AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to think a lot of what comes across as "passive" isn't exactly that, too.

Whenever we played D&amp;D with friends, if someone wanted to join in but didn't want to think too much, they would pay the fighter. But in D&amp;D 4E they had at-wills, encounter, and daily powers to choose from. Additionally, often fighters were now Defenders. With the new focus on teamwork, if you played non-optimally, you didn't just hurt yourself, you hurt everyone. And playing a Defender was often quite tactical. You can't just get by with "I attack", you need to get into the best position to draw agro attacks from opponents and act as a shield for the rest of the PCs. I've heard quite a few players say, D&amp;D 4E should have been called D&amp;D Tactics. <br/><br/>For me, this made D&amp;D more fun.

I've been playing a lot of 5-person Fiasco lately, and one of the benefits of that game with that many people is that you don't have to be on for every scene. In addition, the Fiasco rules explicitly let players say, "I dunno, I'm going to Resolve because I don't know what should happen next." Around our table, that's an invitation for other players to say, "Hm, well, what if we went in <i>this</i> direction?" I've found that, if you take away the blank sheet of paper and give people a seed of a starting idea, often they'll happily run with that seed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328501/#Comment_328501" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T12:25:18+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 12:25PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, this is definitely a thing.<br/><br/>I'm pretty firmly in the camp of, "I only really want to play games which give everyone a chance to participate in a creative and active way," especially since my gaming time is rare these days.<br/><br/>But as I read this thread, I remember not too many years go looking through some of the first "indie" games I was encountering, and mentally categorizing them according to how easy it would be to play passively. For example, I loved the way in the Pool you could narrate an outcome OR take a die instead, so both kinds of players could play alongside each other happily. <br/><br/>Odd to remember that!<br/><br/>People having struggles with being creative, or even just honestly not wanting to, makes me a bit sad.<br/><br/>On the other hand, playing more "intensive" games has shown me that it IS a different thing: I can't imagine playing a game like that late at night, for hours and hours on end. If it's creatively demanding, you have to be ready to produce, too. You have to be in the right mental space to jump in and go for it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan" title="lin_fusan"><img alt="lin_fusan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lin_fusan">lin_fusan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328504/#Comment_328504" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T12:32:24+00:00" title="June  8, 2011 12:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if I would call this friend of mine a passive player, but I recently found out that she preferred my Gamma World game over my Apocalypse World game (and I am the opposite).<br/><br/>I spent some time observing her behavior, and I wonder if it's an issue of self-motivation. The Gamma World game is really D&amp;D 4th ed rehacked, and has a group motivation.

Well, besides the general tone of Story Games are badwrong fun, but that's not really got any traction argument wise especially around here. And less productive. Discussing this feels like it might help folks figure out some ways of making and running games.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack on topic, it's interesting to me because if I didn't want to be playing or invested in the game as much as it seems some would, I just wouldn't play and hang out with the people at other times. Not to say it's not valid to play that way, I'm just curious to know if there's other circumstances that would encourage this over just spending time with folks otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, any other kinds of 'passive' players out there? I feel like there's some meat here we're getting at, like Johnzo's post, other than just some people are less interested in the game.

And creativity just doesnt work like that.  Ideas come when they come, not when you want them to.   So the solution may be to give the spotlight to the person that wants it.  Obviously that has another set of problems, but maybe not so great as CREATIVITY NOW!  which can be downright scary.  even just giving the spotlight player the option to say "pass, I got nothing" could be enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328642/#Comment_328642" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T18:01:12+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  6:01PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember listening to an interview with David Mamet during which he described the appeal of <i>Playboy</i> magazine in terms that really made me think.

We played Once Upon a Time and it was a pain for her to be the narrator, so great that we stopped the game. It's part shyness, part fear of judgment of her contributions. She doesn't play RPG, but when we played Changeling the Dreaming, the lack of turn by turn spotlight was really more comfortable for her, she could play her character only when she has an idea, and I, GM, was there to offer adversity and ideas of my own to react to.<br/><br/>I had a similar (or even worse) experience with Capes, and a player whose first turn it was just bugged and go into silence, unable to come with an idea he judged good enough. We stopped, played Death Angel, and it was good.<br/><br/>Since that last try, I never play Capes with newbies of story games, more so of RPG newbies. Thirs thread makes me think that all turn by turn games are wrong for newbies, since you never know if someone will be a passive/shy/background player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328729/#Comment_328729" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T05:00:39+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  5:00AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nocker - I might agree but for the experience of board game play.

The whole, "Who are you to want to make stories when it's the shiny special people who should be doing it?" shtick annoys me to no end. They're just people, too.<br/><br/>Second, even the pros get nervous with performance anxiety. Actors vomit before going on stage, the writer is struck with terrible fear as he sits there looking at the morning's blank page or screen. In other words, let's not get too high-horse on people who get stuck. <br/><br/>Making things is human. Getting stuck in panic in the act of making is just as human. <i>Accepting</i> these two facts, I have found, has helped me move more swiftly through both making things and getting stuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328745/#Comment_328745" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T07:30:14+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  7:30AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2011 7:30AM by Tristan.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Maybe not so much the self-censorship, but the absolute spotlight says CREATIVITY NOW!

Of course, it requires discipline, and it is tiring and painful at first, but once you improve your strength and stamina, it's downhill all the way.<br/><br/>Honestly, the biggest curative to self-censorship I've yet come across was in Graham's <i>Play Unsafe</i>: <b>Do the Obvious!</b><br/><br/>I swear, just reading that and the explanation of what the phrase meant and why it was important was hugely liberating for me. It's probably something that is universally useful with all RPGs, but especially with Story Games that ask for a lot of player input outside of character.<br/><br/>I don't recall how much Graham goes into in <i>Play Unsafe</i>, but there's a great by-product of keeping <b>Do The Obvious </b>in mind: It helps you get the genre tropes/cliches out and in the open and worked through, and then let's you get on to playing with them and subverting them.<br/><br/>At least I find that to be true even as a GM in a very traditional style of play. I mean, heck, it's called Dungeons&amp; Dragons, right? Doing the obvious as a GM with that would seem to imply getting a dungeon (or ruined icky-place) into play, and also getting a damn dragon in there somewhere, PDQ.<br/><br/>Likewise, I think it helps players of characters get it out there. You're a grumpy alcoholic dwarf with an axe and a scottish accent? Right. Jump in there and hit those bits from step one. Do what you'd obviously do. Don't overthink it right now. Be drunk and hit that thing with an ax while yelling curses from the 15th time you watched Braveheart. Do it until you get it out of your system.<br/><br/>Along the way, as you get that stuff out of your system, other stuff fills in where that stuff left.

Though many gamers learn to do it with experience.<br/><br/>Same deal with "make any character you want!"<br/><br/>But some games require a ton of creativity from you, yet make it very easy, by asking you right questions and giving you the right limitations.

That sort of thing is much easier.)<br/><br/>Still, to me the interesting thing about this particular conversation is about those people who don't enjoy it *even when* the play situation/game system gives them everything they need.

At college, we were taught that creativity is a "muscle". The more you practice it, the easier and painless it becomes. So just like anybody can grab some weights and gain some muscle mass, anybody can start creating and getting better at it. Of course, it requires discipline, and it is tiring and painful at first, but once you improve your strength and stamina, it's downhill all the way.</blockquote>\nI too have a Graphics Design degree (I find that career shockingly common amongst people interested in story games), and were taught something similar. I think the metaphor one professor used was: "You have a little hamster in your head running on his wheel, he is working hard building up momentum, do not let him stop. As soon as you do not let that idea out, that means he stops running, as soon as someone says no he stumbles and the entire cage will come crashing down upon him."<br/><br/>It works. In our writing classes we would often be told to on subject x for 20 min, and you were not allowed to stop. Not allowed to think about what you were writing. If you went completely dry on ideas you were to wright about how you were dry, how it felt, what lead you to those previous ideas, and so on. It usually meant that you would think of something else in that process and could go back to the subject. As we did more and more of this we discovered it was increasingly easier to "Not stop."<br/><br/>As for gaming I find that some many players are just afraid to speak up, either out of social akwardness, another player or GM judging their thoughts, or just an expectation that it would be stepping "On someones toes." It took some effort, and I still do not get the entirely desired results, but I have managed to pull most every player out of that mindset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328875/#Comment_328875" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T14:41:49+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  2:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I'm primarily talking about telling people what to do during the session.
