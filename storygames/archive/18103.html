Instead of putting them in bite-size, I figured I'd put them in their own post chronologically. They start mid-season, but you should be able to follow along.<br/><br/><br/><br/>totally cried in our game of Monsterhearts last night.<br/><br/>I'm playing Cassidy, the werewolf, and her boyfriend, Cole the ghoul and her had this crazy thing going on for awhile. She became a way to satiate his hunger, and he wasn't easily broken if she wolfed out. It worked, but there was so much strife in their relationship! He was an ex-jock, she was a trailer park druggie. He had a temper nearly as bad as hers. He was crushin pretty hard on the boy fae Gail, and she was fairly possessive.<br/><br/>Then Cole died, and his dad remade him to be Cage. New memories, new boy, didn't remember Cassidy at all (cause his dad hates her) and even had a built in girlfriend (an NPC chosen named Jade). The cliche fights ensued for a few sessions, but shit hit the fan when Cage slept with Jade because he thought Cassidy was sleeping with Gail. And then when she felt their spirit connection break, Cassidy DID sleep with Gail. ALL SORTS OF GREAT DRAMA HAPPENED, including the fae going into his darkest self for the first time this session and cause all sorts of harm to Cassidy for breaking little promises to him left and right.<br/><br/>Last night, Cage and Cassidy might've made up except a few key things happened. His phone accidentally dialed her when Cage and Jade were sexin it up. She had a spirit vision (which happens on our games on the full moon for my werewolf) where she was given the choice between Cage and Cole and she chose Cole, which just fueled her She Wolf rage. Cage's dad offered her a deal, I'll heal your Mom (her mom has MS) if you stay away from Cage, and I'll even sweeten the deal by erasing your memories of him.<br/><br/>She agreed, but couldn't go through with it without one last call to Cage. She found out earlier that day he was avoiding her because he helped her out with a plot point. That made her even sadder. She explained the deal Cage's dad gave her, and he told her to take it, knowing regardless of what they used to have or might've had, her mom was more important. Cassidy agreed, and said "well, bye I guess. Say hi to me at school." I was tearing up in real life. AND THEN CASSIDY HAD HER MEMORIES OF HER AND COLE ERASED. All she remembered is that he had died, and she had mourned for him.<br/><br/>Everybody was so quiet and sad at the table. It was like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind just happened in front of us. Everything I loved about teen drama, memories of self and relationships in sci-fi, and tragic romance happened all at once. I dunno, I guess it was just pretty intense because we had actually gone through so much relationship drama at the table with the string mechanics, it felt like the end of an actual relationship. It was so great.<br/><br/>And this was just my character arc last night! We also had a mermaid posing as a boy who was trying to be a real person and stole our selkie's pelt, a mysterious dark man made out of smoke in a trenchcoat has the ability to possess our fae Gail, and a new PC chosen joined our group, Jackson. He thinks we're all cray cray, and he tried to kill Gail and Cage!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408718/#Comment_408718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T07:31:47+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  7:31AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even though last session ended with the supposed end of Cage (ghoul) and Cassidy's (werewolf) relationship via the wiping of all her memories of them together in exchange for the health of her mom, THE RELATIONSHIP TENSION CONTINUES ON. I mean, how could it not. Now its even more dramatic, because of the emo tension of lost memories and growing up and doing the right thing. Despite Cage and Cassidy now trying to give no fucks, the other players are shipping us and pushing our characters in the most awkward/painful situations ever.<br/><br/>Cage's hunger can still eerily be satiated by sex w/Cassidy. GM makes Cage insanely hungry while Cassidy is around. Hasn't happened yet, but waiting for that creepy scene.<br/>Cage insists on keeping Cassidy's memories intact, while Gail and Rowan push to telling her the truth. Constant conversation awkwardness.<br/>Cage Rowan (selkie) and Gail (fae) had a threesome (!!!! WHAT) under Cassidy's trailer after a rough night of saving Cage's father and sister from death kind of. Yea that happened. The morning after, Rowan had to meet up with Jackson (chosen) before school to discuss the loss of Jackson's virginity to a mermaid/man who stole his "manhood". Gail was leaving early to sabotage Cage's relationship with Jade (npc chosen) because we suspect she's hunting the group, and she'll totally break up with Cage once Gail tells her he's slept with him. That left Cassidy to babysit Cage before school, and they talked like it was old times but it wasn't old times and it was so sad. Jade kept texting Cage, and he kept ignoring her texts, and Cassidy had this great line where she was like "Why are you dating her anyway? She's so controlling and aggressive and she's just using you anyway." Which was basically what Cassidy did in their relationship. Poor Cage.<br/><br/>MONSTERHEARTS = DRIVE THAT DAGGER DEEPER<br/><br/>One thing mechanically that I find really satisfying about long term play in this game is that the moves really do flow with the game. Now that we've got a good handle on them, it's really easy to craft a scene and create drama and know the exact moment to push with a move or draw things out uncomfortably before the next storm of moves. Also, advancement is really satisfying, and all of us discuss the ways our characters are developing and growing and we all want to play to find out more about our characters. It's like watching a teen tv show, for sure, without a doubt, and in actuality.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408719/#Comment_408719" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T07:32:03+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  7:32AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We ended with a bit of a cliffhanger previous session. Gail (fae) had taken Cage's (ghoul) doll-like sister for safe keeping back to his newly discovered fae family who live in a fae abandoned hospital. The characters tracked Gail and the sister down. The problem was, Gail wasn't allowed to let us in, it was the only rule his fae family had set down. But we needed to get Cage's sister, so we went in anyway. Cue crazy scenes in fae-land.<br/><br/>The fun part about this is that we were both playing two characters. (so far, whenever one character has NPCs in a gang, we all get to play one of the NPCs. The same was true of the faeries.) So the players were able to poke at the other player characters with the NPCs. Our group does this a bunch in various games, and it's pretty fun.<br/><br/>One of the fae is a Master Duellist. She challenges Cassidy (werewolf) to a duel of course (the most intimidating physical character there) and the two of them exchange some awful blows, the duellist wielding a silver sword. The duellist nearly dead, Cassidy uses her Mercy move, but the duellist fills up all four of the werewolf's harm regardless, pushing Cassidy into her darkest self. A raging blackfurred beast stalks the halls.<br/><br/>Another fae is a beautiful Princess. A romantic, she becomes obsessed with the "hero from the sea", our (selkie) Rowan. Rowan just wants to find Cage's sister, and says she looks like a doll, and so the Princess takes her to her dollhouse, where row after row of dolls with the faces of people Rowan knows at school are lined. The Princess proceeds to distract Rowan as much as possible, taking him to a ball, saying "just one more dance" to keep him distracted.<br/><br/>The third fae, a Barrow Wight, speaks to the dead, and so of course hones in on Cage (ghoul). They exchange witty remarks about how dead they both are, but the Barrow Wight pokes at Cage. He's searching for his sister, and when he turns to go the fae presents him with ten exits. "What do you really desire, in that empty shell you inhabit" the fae asks. Cage responds "I dunno, I guess, I don't know who I am". The fae tosses him a coin and says "Choose a direction."<br/><br/>Finally, Jackson (chosen) is confronted with a giant Snake fae. This fae just wants to eat him. Jackson fails an attack role, and jumps to the worst possible conclusion, Gail tricked them all into coming into the fae realm so they could all be destroyed. The snake bit him nearly to death, but in the end made Gail appear before them all. Jackson proceeds to attack Gail, thinking he's the enemy. The head of the household, a woman with a beehive hairdo, enters the scene and rolls out a contract before Gail. "I hate to do this, but you broke your promise." And Gail disappears (he retires his character).<br/><br/>All the characters are outside, but the action isn't over yet! Cassidy is still in her darkest self, and rips into Cage (it was funny, we all rolled for who of the PCs would be attacked, and everyone was so excited to get the highest number! So emo). She has a homebrewed power called Unrepentant Rage (or something I can't remember) where she can't help but do two damage when she lashes out physically. Cage flies across the graveyard, but Cassidy doesn't stop here (she doesn't care for Cage anymore!!) and the werewolf drooling and mad turns on Rowan. Rowan points at the moon saying "It's not even full Cassidy!" but Cassidy just sees his hand and jumps on him, ravaging his arm. Jackson stabs the werewolf, but it's Cages words the help sedate the beast. He calls her on her shit, saying "Cassidy this is bullshit, how you just lash out and hurt the people you care about. Get over yourself". The werewolf sees how much she hurt Cage and Rowan, and comes out of her rage, shaking and naked, and Rowan, with savaged arm, proceeds to _comfort her_.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the condition Cage gets for calling her on her shit is "heartless". The player takes this literally, and where Cage's heart used to be before the werewolf encounter is a hole. The other PCs proceed home with Cage's sister, but Cage stays to satiate his hunger. Cassidy proceeds to look for his heart in the ravine nearby, which leads to an uncomfortable sex scene with the two characters (because Cassidy can still satiate Cage's hunger, but she doesn't remember having sex with him). He's in his darkest self, but Cassidy's turned on, and she gives herself to him feeling pretty guilty about tearing his heart out when she was a werewolf. Sex moves are exchanged (Cassidy now has Cage back on her possessive list, Cassidy remains a way Cage can satiate his hunger). All kinds of angst. And what, these two can't escape each other.<br/><br/>The next day at school there's a new character Victoria (queen). She has a bad luck amulet that's causing all sorts of havok. Cage's "girlfriend" Jade meets up with him and wants to know if he got her sexts, he relents to a date with her. Cassidy and Rowan meet up after school in the drug van, wallow in misery, cigarettes, and vodka, and have misery hook up sex. They feel marginally better afterwards and sex moves are exchanged (Cassidy has Rowan and Cage on her possessive list now, and Rowan has strings on Cage). Jackson flirts with the new girl Victoria, and has a date lined up. Hope she doesn't notice his junk is missing (still stolen from the mermaid/man, still unresolved til next time!).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408720/#Comment_408720" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T07:32:15+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  7:32AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rowan's (selkie) bad luck continues, as he's acquired a charm somehow that keeps inflicting horrible things on him. He gets bitten by a rabid dog in the parkinglot. Cassidy (werewolf) walks him to the nurse's office, where he gets healed, and the two of them bump into Jackson (chosen) and Victoria (queen) on the way out. Rowan and Cassidy are still pissed at Jackson for stabbing everyone last session, so treat him pretty poorly. Jackson gets some healin for his condition "snake bites all over my body" also from last session.<br/><br/>As they're leaving, Rowan and Cassidy are talking about spending some time together. Since they slept together last session, Cassidy has been pretty possessive of Rowan. She suggests they hang out tonight, and Rowan suggests his beach house. Victoria overhears them, and says "Oh, there's a beach party tonight?" Victorian and Cassidy have a bitchy staredown, Cassidy accuses her of being a fake punk rock band because she doesn't know any of the punk kids, but when Victoria says she'll bring weed Rowan ends up inviting everyone over. It's not even Rowan's house, he's just squatting there.<br/><br/>Before the party Jackson and Victoria have a scene where Victoria offers the weed to Jackson, telling him to give it to Cassidy to get back on her good side. They're both getting dressed in swimwear, but Jackson is still smooth like a ken doll since the mermaid stole his junk! He backs his trunks hastily with toilet paper, hoping no one will notice.<br/><br/>At the beach party before everyone arrives Rowan and Cassidy have an intimate chat. She finds out Rowan has slept with most of the group, and it's all been guy on guy. "So, all the guys I've slept with recently are gay?" Cass asks, and Rowan says "I dunno, does that count?" It ends with Cassidy asking "So, like, are we dating now?" but everyone arrives and the question is left unanswered. Victoria brings her "punk band" called Twatrocket to hang out with everyone. Jackson delivers Cassidy the weed, and they exchange intimacies to gain strings on each other (a homebrew move). Meanwhile, Victoria and Rowan and the band are going skinny dipping, but its mostly awkward. Victoria hits on Jackson, but then promptly turns him down "Get in the van, take off your pants, get out of the van!" While Rowan is skinny dipping, Cassidy steals Rowan's pelt and hides it in the trunk of Victoria's car. Rowan turns Cage on while he's further down the beach with Jade (npc chosen). Jackson gets stoned with Cassidy because he can't hook up with Victoria, and Cassidy just gets more and more angsty about Rowan. The three of them pass out in the beach house.<br/><br/>Cage heads back to his house, into his basement, and begins to labor over a table with his empty sister on it. His father's tools and pocketwatch lie there, useless and silent.<br/><br/>In the morning they're confronted by the real owners of the house. There's a brief conflict and Jackson stands in the way of Cassidy's lash out, taking two harm. They all head to school late. On the way, Graham (npc werewolf in Cassidy's pack) drives by on a motorcycle and says they need to talk. Rowan hates this dude, and tries to shut him down. Fails horribly, he just laughs at Rowan, and Cassidy takes the ride to school. Victoria catches up with Rowan and Jackson, and offers Rowan to come over to her place and hang out, cause if Cassidy's hanging out with other people, why can't he? They skip school.<br/><br/>Graham tells Cassidy the Order is in town, so she needs to lay low. Asks why they never hung out, offers to take her on a date, they get to school and Cassidy turns him on (she wants him wrapped around her finger, but in order to do it she has to best him in physical combat, which they make a "date" for later). Cassidy runs into Cage and Jackson in the school parkinglot, all arriving late. Jackson stops them both, forcing the three of them to actually talk. Cassidy confronts Cage, telling him to stay away from her and Rowan. Things escalate, he calls her on her shit, she lashes out, he takes two harm. They go to school.<br/><br/>Victoria all day has been plying Rowan with drinks and smokes for no other discernible reason than to shake things up or assert her scheming dominance over the group. Her band invites everyone over to her house for a garage party. We all go (PCs) and Cassidy walks in to see Rowan draped over Victoria. Cassidy sits, stewing, gets into a convo with Rowan about where they're at in their relationship, and due to a failed turn on roll both Cassidy and Rowan jump to the wrong conclusions: Rowan thinks they're open to sleep with anyone, Cassidy thinks they're exclusive. Cage and one of the band members start flirting on Cassidy and Rowan's couch, Cassidy pulls Cage aside to tell him to stay away from them one more time. Brings up they're really awkward forest sex last session, then goes on to accuse him of having sex with Rowan and Gail. She tries to call him out on his shit, but fails, so the move reverses on her. Victoria grins at the havok she's caused. Cage runs away, and Cassidy's phone rings, and it's Graham (npc werewolf from her pack) sounding dead or dying and he says "You have to get out of here," and Jade comes on the line saying "You're next bitch." The PCs can't see this, but the camera pans away and Jackson is standing beside Jade.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408741/#Comment_408741" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T11:27:07+00:00" title="March 11, 2013 11:27AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that sounds intense.<br/><br/>I love how the surreal elements overlap with teenagers drinking and smoking pot - a great way to do Monsterhearts.<br/><br/>Thanks for posting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
