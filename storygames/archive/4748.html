Essentially, what I\u2019d like to see a game designed to do for mythology and epic poetry what PTA does for dramatic, ensemble television. A game with which a group could sit down and, through the system, tell stories that weave together to collaboratively weave rich tapestries the likes of the Scandinavian sagas, The Simarillion, the Elder Scrolls crpg series, Greek, Indian and Sumerian mythology, or any of the other bodies of mythic literature that I adore.<br/><br/>The basic idea I have is to combine collaborative world-building with storytelling informed by the style and tone of folk-epics. As I\u2019m currently imagining it, play take place in a series of Tales, each comprised of a single session of play. Each Tale would expand and detail body of myth by focusing on the trials and experiences of key figures, ie the Protagonists. Tales would be stand-alone to the extent that the aim would be reach their conclusion in one sitting. However, there would be a critical requirement that each Tale feature at least one Linking Aspect or Protagonist introduced in a previous Tale, thus establishing an element of continuity. <br/><br/>So, if in the last session our Tale ended with the heartbroken princess fleeing into the wilderness rather than wed the cruel king of a rival kingdom, this session we might tell the story of a pair of heroic rivals weathering a storm in a foreboding cave only to encounter the mournful visage of a spectral maiden. Similarly the curse of a god against a mortal who defied him could return as a doom upon one of his decedents, another protagonist, centuries later.<br/><br/>There would be no requirement to tell tales in any particular sequence, chronological or otherwise. A group could jump back and forth telling Tales in any preferred order, discovering the fabric of their shared mythology as they went. Each Tale could feature entirely unique casts of Protagonists (remembering to include the Linking Aspect), or the group could construct a \u2018Cycle\u2019 of Tales revolving around a specific cast of characters.<br/><br/>Taking a page from Covenant, the group could start by setting the tone and style for their series of Tales with Conventions and Motifs. From there a number of Aspects (characters, places, things, fates, etc.) would be proposed by each player to start things off, with new Aspects proposed at the beginning of each subsequent Tale. Tales would also have a Title Aspect that would not only to identify the particular story (ie. \u201cThe House of Alshain\u201d) but also serve as the central narrative element the conflict and drama of the Tale would revolve around. In order to dial the preferred level of divine intervention/activity, the group could choose to set a Tale in either the Age of Gods, the early origin stories where the acts of gods are frequent and the primary focus; the Age of Heroes where gods and mortals mingle freely; or the Age of Men, where though supernatural elements may exist mortal bring about their own fate, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Considering the excellent play experiences my group has derived from both PTA  (collaborative show creation) and Polaris (ritual and conflict phrases), as well as other relevant games like Universalis (the anything story-game!), I\u2019m looking at borrowing elements from each of these as a starting point for this design. However, I have a concerns: does the focus of such a game sound to wide?  I\u2019m also trying to nail down how to mechanically facilitate interesting play <b>within</b> each Tale, apart from the enjoyment derived from the collaborative world/myth building. I think the breadth of material I\u2019m drawing from might be the source of this difficulty. It\u2019s obvious that the Ramayana has a different literary and cultural style to it than the Odyssey or the Gilgamesh epics. Then I look at the numerous genres of television out there and I still feel confident to tackle any of them with PTA.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106914/#Comment_106914" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T23:43:04+00:00" title="November  5, 2007 11:43PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mythic poetry is awesome. Tell me more about who would play the protagonists and who would provide diversity. And how would the game facilitate the creation of tales? Do the players have to bring their own experiences of these epics to the table, or would the game provide any help there?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
