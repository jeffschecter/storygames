We had (and have) a vague agreement that if we totally disagree we can each go our own way, each publishing our own version of the game and each using the resources (text and art) created by the other for the original version of the game.<br/><br/>We split the writing duties pretty evenly, but I ended up doing the layout, book design and art, and over the years I've also maintained our store, filled orders and done most of the promoting. Which is fine. I think that there would be a fair basis for renegotiating our deal, but honestly I don't really care. In the end our agreement comes down to this: I do what I do, Matt does what he does, and everything gets split. This works because we're friends, because Panty Explosion was a hobby project and because we both realized from the beginning that equal effort was impossible.<br/><br/>Classroom Deathmatch was a different issue. Nick and I developed the game based on the PE rule set, so when it came time to decide what belonged to who and how the money was getting split, we decided that Matt and I would own the game, but we'd split the money three ways. Even though everyone made a nice bit of bank, we were never very happy with the decision. Now that we're reprinting the game Nick owns a 3rd of the new Classroom Deathmatch book, and when we get around to doing a new version of the game at some point it will be with Nick as a full 1/3rd partner.<br/><br/>Nick and I don't have any kind of agreement for Sea Dracula, other than that it belongs to both of us. With The Magical Land of Yeld we've adopted a pretty standard 50/50 agreement, even though Yeld was deep in development when I invited Nick to join the project.<br/><br/>If this all sounds loose and sloppy, it's because these are agreements built on relationships. Nick is my brother, and Matt is like a brother to me (Travis Brown too, who I worked under a similar agreement with on CrossRoads of Eternity, and who has had a deep hand in Yeld). In each case I'm working with these people because I know them and trust them, and I can't conceive of a situation which would cause a rift which would harm the project. Or rather, none of these projects are important enough to me that I wouldn't ditch them at a moments notice if I thought they were harming my relationships with these guys. <br/><br/>I guess what it comes down to is that I only work with people I completely trust, and even then I make sure we have a simple agreement in place to make sure we both share the burdens and rewards equally. "Equally" is important, by the way.<br/><br/>I hope that was helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294844/#Comment_294844" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T18:45:52+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  6:45PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2010 6:46PM by Matt Snyder.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking a lot about this topic for roughly 2 years. My thoughts have developed most recently into Indigo. It is my currently "be the change" solution to the problems and issues surrounding this topic.<br/><br/>Most accessible are two blog posts here about co-operatives: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.storiesyouplay.com/blog/2010/02/marketing-co-operative-proposal-introduction-proposal/" rel="nofollow">Marketing Co-Operative Proposal: Introduction and Proposal</a><br/><a href="http://www.storiesyouplay.com/blog/2010/02/marketing-co-operative-proposal-membership/" rel="nofollow"><br/>Marketing Co-Operative Proposal, Part 1: Membership</a><br/><br/>Only somewhat embarrassingly, I never wrote and posted part 2. That's because as I gave it more thought, I found it more feasible to head in a different direction, itself a means for people to collaborate. I kicked that off here: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.storiesyouplay.com/blog/2010/05/open-game-design-project-part-1/" rel="nofollow">Open game design project: Part 1</a><br/><a href="http://www.storiesyouplay.com/blog/2010/05/open-game-design-project-part-2/" rel="nofollow">Open game design project: Part 2</a><br/><a href="http://www.storiesyouplay.com/blog/2010/06/open-game-design-project-underway/" rel="nofollow">Open game design project underway</a><br/><br/>And, now Indigo is underway. I'm thrilled that it's kept going. It's got legs. I wish it did have more participants, however. I have to say, I'm chuckling and sighing that this post comes up months later, seemingly unaware of the above. Oh well, inadequate communication on my part. <br/><br/>Anyone reading this is welcome to join the Indigo Google group. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/open-game-design-project" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/open-game-design-project</a>.

I propose publication format/plan/etc, and he gets to say "no" (he hasn't yet). As publisher, I cover up-front costs (printing and postage, and technically website site, tho thats folded in to my "own" stuff). After those costs are paid for, we split the income from it 50/50.<br/><br/>I have exclusive rights to publish the print book until one or the other of us terminates the agreement (which either of us can do at any time, for any reason, with I think a couple of weeks notice). I have non-exclusive rights to publish a digital version (so, if Dev wants, he can put up a free html version, or make an epub, or do other tricky things without having to go through me). I have no rights at all to the content, and anything I generate for publication goes to Dev if he wants it (so, if he wants to publish it himself, I'll give him all the graphic and layout files). We also have a "don't be a dick" clause in our agreement, which is about if one of us is uncomfortable with the arrangement, we'll talk about it like friends and figure it out.<br/><br/>As for the sticky wicket of someone deciding not to publish it anymore when the other person wants it - I think our agreement leaves that pretty much in Dev's hands. If he doesn't want to publish it anymore, he can end the agreement and I don't have the rights to publish. If I don't want to publish anymore for some weird reason, Dev can end the agreement, in which case he gets the rights and all the materials for publication (including my printing contacts) back and can self-publish or go to someone else.<br/><br/>As for the Italian Annalise, yeh, it's a licensed derivative work. Maybe one of the Narattiva folks will be willing to go into their model in more detail - from my end, they send me a contract, we negotiate a couple points, then I sign it and get royalties each quarter. I also get approval over the cover, and some free books.<br/><br/>Hope some of that is interesting/helpful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295433/#Comment_295433" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T18:06:26+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  6:06PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

We based our agreement off the model Dave Sim and Gerhard used for Cerebus, which seemed to work okay for them for like... 20 years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
