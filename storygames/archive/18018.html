I appreciate all the support for the project. But years have passed since the Fundable backer campaign. The fact is, if I haven\u2019t finished the book by now there\u2019s no reason to think it will ever get finished.<br/><br/>I\u2019m contacting all the backers to return their money. I have a list of all the amounts due.<br/><br/>1) If you would like your money repaid by PayPal, please send me the name of PayPal account to return the money to.<br/>2) If you would like me to mail you a check, please send me your name and address and I\u2019ll get it off in the mail.<br/><br/>I have records of the donations. They are listed by the name each person would have used to make the payment via PayPal.<br/><br/>Finally, if you were a backer but did not receive the email, one of three things has happened:<br/><br/>1) Your email has changed in the intervening years. (It happens!)<br/>2) You used a different email for the PayPal payment than you use for normal correspondence<br/>3) This is the frustrating one: Fundable.com (the Kickstarter before there was Kickstarter) didn't have all the bugs worked out. (Which might be why they went out of business.) For about two dozen backers the email list was incomplete: I have the portion of the PayPal email address before the "@" and I have the amount donated. But I am missing the domains of those email addresses.<br/><br/>If you contributed to the fund and did not get the email, please contact me at \u201cchristopherkubasik\u201d at the email place that starts with a g. Include the email address you would have used to fund the project through PayPal so I can match the name to the amount due.<br/><br/>Also, for the reasons just listed, if you know anyone who backed the project, please pass this information on to them so I can make sure to get all monies refunded.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Christopher Kubasik                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407031/#Comment_407031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T12:34:36+00:00" title="February 23, 2013 12:34PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Christopher: It must be hard throwing in the towel, but thanks so much for actively pursuing refunds.
