OK, the plan is that this will be a short digest-sized thing licensing Chad Underkoffler's PDQ system (and I should note that it'll need final approval from him, though I don't anticipate any problems).<br/><br/>It arose from comments in a review of Questers of the Middle Realms at RPGnet that this humorous fantasy (which some people don't "get" anyway; Chad thinks it's cos I'm English and too subtle for the market, heh) is all very well but they'd like to see a "serious" PDQ fantasy game. Unfortunately, as is often the way, it snagged on something in my head - including a thought I've often had that most of the published PDQ stuff tends to be a bit light and funny, and I've wanted to see something a bit heavier and darker. <br/><br/>So, Jaws is heading in a roughly sword-and-sorcery direction, but I'm not too hung up on genre emulation and it will be its own thing with whatever oddness jumps out of my brain. It won't be terribly dark; just a bit gritty underfoot. I'm seeing it as a quick project to do, because the rules content is mostly taking material from Questers, condensing it further and adjusting the tone. The setting will be quite simply outlined, including the idea that cultures have come and gone, and will again, and characters are basically aiming to get ahead in a somewhat harsh world. Back to the roots of killing things and taking their stuff! It'll actually be even closer to basic PDQ than Questers, because the more I think about it the more I see that Qualities will handle this stuff pretty well - specify what's important about the character and flag those things up for potential hooks. Instead of non-human races and fantasy nations I'm going with the idea of Peoples - everyone's human, though some groups were slightly altered in times gone by (eg breath-holding and webbed digits), and characters might or might not have much connection to their birth-People. Magic is quite limited - sorcerers can do a lot, with time, but it's risky; some people know a couple of limited charms; and magic items are very rare.<br/><br/>So, basically a book that's quick to read, inexpensive and reasonably pretty (been buying art, there go my earnings!) that'll help to get people into a flexible and simple system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73734/#Comment_73734" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T05:34:57+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  5:34AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2007 5:41AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your interest, Andrew.<br/><br/><i>Misspent Youth: A Game of Juvenile Delinquency and Being Awesome</i> is a near-future sci-fi game where you play a group of 12-to-17-year-old friends who are out to smash The Authority, a force of some kind which is out to destroy that which you hold dear. The players collaboratively create The Authority, define the world, then make their own characters to fight against and fit into it, respectively.<br/><br/>Character (and Authority) creation involves choosing from a list of 5 possibilities for each of 3 Closed traits. This "splat" style creation allows for a strong thematic framework, which is then given flesh in character creation by a number of Open traits, where one inserts a short phrase a la Dogs in the Vineyard. Youthful Offender (PC) traits are also Free or Sold, with all starting out as Free, and the opportunity to Sell them coming in conflict. The final part of character creation involves asking one other player a question about your characters' friendship, which that person must answer.<br/><br/>In an Operation (session), each player (including the Authority (GM) player) takes turns framing scenes (all YOs are assumed to be present unless specifically narrated out (thanks Don Corchran for the idea)). The first scene is a Kicker for an attack on or reaction to something done by the Authority. <br/><br/>Resolution involves setting stakes and then playing a craps-like game, and all conflicts are assumed to be group conflicts against the Authority, even those where in the fiction, the YOs are arguing with each other (their dissension is an Authority force). If the conflict is not resolved in the first throw, there's a follow-on a la craps. The YOs choose to Step Up or Say Uncle, and if they choose to Step Up, must roll before declaring what they are going to do, and probably shouldn't have a plan, either. If the YOs hit any number not owned by the Authority, they are assumed to be winning and the thrower chooses a trait, narrating what would be a win if unopposed. At that point, the Authority decides whether or not to push and force another roll. If the YOs hit a number they'd automatically lose on, the Authority can Tempt the thrower to Sell a trait, in which case it takes its Authority form (predetermined for Closed traits, for Open Traits one rewrites the trait), and the YOs win the conflict. <br/><br/>At the end of a conflict, depending on the number of pushes, either the Authority gets a bunch of Authority Points or the Youthful Offenders get a bunch of Cool points for the pool. Cool can be distributed for people narrating awesome stuff or can be claimed if players let their YOs' traits get in the way of their goals. These points are spent to establish facts about the world. At the end of the Operation, whoever has more facts established wins the Operation, and authors a fact about the world. If the losing side has half or greater of the winners, they get to add a rider on to this fact, a la Mortal Coil.<br/><br/>I think that's an overview of just about everything, other than to add there's a Spotlight mechanic a la PTA. If you have any other questions I'd be happy to expound though I fear I may have gassed on too long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73757/#Comment_73757" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T08:14:39+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  8:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Resolution involves setting stakes and then playing a craps-like game, and all conflicts are assumed to be group conflicts against the Authority, even those where in the fiction, the YOs are arguing with each other (their dissension is an Authority force).

It was a blast. Rolling before you know which trait you are using is a gorgeous way to plug the sense of youthful impulsiveness straight into the players. It may be something you have to experience before you believe, but that tiniest of rules makes all the difference in the world. There is plenty to praise in this game, but I have a special affinity for rules that help the players feel a bit like their characters, and I think this one is an important one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73767/#Comment_73767" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T09:37:10+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  9:37AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brennan Taylor</cite>Still working on<b>How We Came to Live Here</b>, my Southwest Native American themed game.

Although <i>How We Came to Live Here</i> is loosely based on the same culture and region, it's completely fantastic (in the 'not historical' meaning of the word). The basic premise is that the People have come up into the Fifth World quite recently, emerging from a world below through a hole in the ground. The Fifth World is populated by monsters, and the People have begun to slay the monsters and carve out a place to live.<br/><br/>The People are the only humans in this world, and play takes place in a village that is sketched out during character creation. The last part of the character generation process is building the relationship map of the village. Characters are defined by traits that are resources to be called upon in conflict. These are finite, they get checked off as they are used, and when the players have exhausted their resources and are ready to have them reset, the GM gets a threat round where he introduces or escalates internal and external threats to the village.<br/><br/>Characters advance by building Renown or Inside points, which can be spent to improve the character or change things within the village. They also have a pool of Outside points, which are gained by performing criminal acts. Outside points can be spent by the GM to harm the character or those close to the character. There is an incentive to gain Outside points in the conflict system. Characters are also defined by three ambitions: renown, or what the character wants to be famous for; inside, or what position the character ultimately wants to achieve in the village; and outside, what crime the character wants to commit. This is working really well. Michael Miller sat down for a playtest and told me afterward that he tried to create a character that would do nothing, because he was really tired that night and was trying to duck out of play without saying so. He then said that the ambitions didn't allow him to do that, especially the outside ambition.<br/><br/>Characters are also members of kiva societies, which grant abilities and have ranks that characters must attempt to climb. Characters can join more than one kiva society, but must spend points from their pools to advance or join additional societies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73774/#Comment_73774" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T10:08:18+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 10:08AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oo, this sounds neat and pretty fascinating.<br/><br/>BTW, one thing I need to work on in my game is make <b>BWBR</b> less "historical," and more mythohistorical.<br/><br/>Your system sounds interesting and workable.

Characters are defined both in usual RPG attributes and with Themes that describe what sorts of stories happen around them. The stronger their normal attributes, the lower their Themes are, and vice versa. They work for the Patent Office, in much the same way that U.S. Secret Service agents work for the Department of the Treasury. The Patent Office is run by AIs who can send themselves information from the future, which is the seed for nearly everything that happens in the game.<br/><br/>A longer version:<br/><br/>Each character is from one of the surviving human cultures (fourteen are detailed in the book, plus there's an option for playing by making up your civilization as you go along), spread across the universe and connected by wormholes. Most of them are based on certain fringe cultures from Earth, with the idea that the major countries back on Earth choked each other to death long ago.<br/><br/>All characters work for the Patent Office, whose primary job is to keep the universe's economy relatively stable, and whose secondary job is to make sure that each of these civilizations stays around. The Transcendentals are lonely, and have a long-term plan for giving everyone the same sort of cross-time life that they have. The game tends to be pretty mission-based. It may not surprise you that actual patent violations are typically a side-note for most sessions.<br/><br/>Characters are defined in game terms by the following things:\n<ul><li><i>Core Values,</i> which are things you care about. These give you minor bonuses to doing what you believe in, and major bonuses for resisting people trying to convince you otherwise.</li>\n<li><i>Themes,</i> which are various types of stories that happen around your character. The higher your rating is in a particular Theme, the greater effect you can bring about by spending a Twist. If you need more than one Twist per session, you take Complications, which make your life harder in specific ways.</li>\n<li><i>Capabilities,</i> which represent your built-in technology. These are much like most traditional game's attributes. Each one has a Reserve rating, which you can spend to be more effective or reliable.</li>\n<li><i>Professions,</i> which represent your training and experiences. These have Reserve too, and more of it.<br/>And by your choice of Civilization, and perhaps a cross-civ Society.</li></ul>\nThe system handles generalized conflict, which is to say anything from a fistfight to a baseball game to psychohistorical maneuvering. You roll off, and if you don't like the roll, you lose some Reserve and make your own roll to try to change things. You can give in to save your Reserve if you don't care, or you can escalate to using Themes. In playtests the game flowed very smoothly from ordinary gameplay with the occasional dice roll to full-on conflict and back out again. There are even rules for having a smaller-scale conflict (like a political debate) affect a larger-scale one (like a cold war).<br/><br/>Themes are a very big deal in this game. They don't take it over entirely, but they are definitely the "Big Gun" that players have. The GM is encouraged to play a little rough, because players can almost always come out on top one way or another.<br/><br/>Some minor interesting points:\n<ul><li>The game is as hard-science as I could make it. Wormholes are my major nod to soft sci-fi, and they still seem somewhat plausible to me. And yes, I know that every wormhole is by necessity a time machine - there are a few causal loops in the setting, mostly in the Transcendentals.</li>\n<li>Not every civilization succeeded; there are a lot of "cargo cults" out there, oriented around a single surviving technology.</li>\n<li>Twists can be used in immediate ways, to bring in specific story elements or change an outcome, or in a less immediate way, to create longer-reaching effects. Multiple players can contribute to these, but Complications can also screw them up.</li>\n<li>Most characters will have instantaneous mental access to the internet (well, post-internet, really) from any location.</li>\n<li>There are four known sentient alien species. None of them are in the least bit playable.</li>\n<li>The weapons are hideously nasty, even the social ones. Therefore, losing Reserve isn't like taking a hit and sucking it up; it represents you spending effort to avoid getting hit. Only when you're out of Reserve is there an actual effect.</li></ul>\nHere are some links:<br/><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/suffadv" rel="nofollow">The development journal</a> has a LOT of stuff, including some reports from the playtests (the stuff from tempralisis' run is particularly good) and various ramblings from me.<br/><a href="http://wrpigeek.deviantart.com/prints/" rel="nofollow">Prints of some of the civilization's emblems</a> on my DeviantArt account.<br/><a href="http://wrpigeek.deviantart.com/gallery/literature/" rel="nofollow">Various pieces of "fluff text"</a>; I recommend starting with <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/54182455/?qo=19&amp;q=by%3Awrpigeek+in%3Aliterature&amp;qh=sort%3Atime+-in%3Ascraps" rel="nofollow">A Tale From Earth.</a><br/><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/55616488/?qo=4&amp;q=by%3Awrpigeek&amp;qh=sort%3Atime+-in%3Ascraps" rel="nofollow">The character sheet</a><br/><br/>If you're interested in seeing an unfinished version, just let me know.

It's a competive RPG-board game hybrid that involves secretly choosing what scene types you want to participate in during a given turn (e.g., Research, Obtain Funding, Gather Materials, Experiment), each of which serves a specific function - granting a type of currency, refreshing abilities, or moving you closer to the end game. If more than one player chooses the same scene type, then they appear in the scene together and must compete to attain the benefit of that scene type. If you're the only one that chooses a scene type, then you only face a general opposition amount to gain the benefit. <br/><br/>The game asks what parts of yourself (favorite possessions, relationships, and personal talents) you're willing to destroy in order to achieve your obsession. You can burn various character traits to succeed where you might otherwise fail. There's also a deck of cards for the materials used in your experiments that stand in for various body parts. They can add or subtract from your score, affecting who wins, but also contain elements that must be incorporated into the character epilogues if you use them. Of course, the cards that add the most to your score have elements like "Doom" or "Madness," while the less fresh bits that hurt your score give you a chance at "Love" or "Redemption." The characters are pregens, and the game is no-prep, GMless, and meant to be played in a single sitting. <br/><br/>The link above tells you a bit more about the premise and has links to the current rules.<br/><br/>Iain,<br/><br/>I'll come back around and tell you more about "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries" a bit later today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73883/#Comment_73883" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T21:41:40+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  9:41PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://ericjboyddesigns.com/The_Committee.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</a> is a storytelling game of pulp-inspired exploration - think Indiana Jones, adventure pulps, and the works of Jules Verne. The characters are larger-than-life heroes recently returned from an expedition recounting their tales before the gathered Committee. Their aim is to garner the acclaim of their peers sufficient to achieve their greatest desire, the burning passion that has seen them through the travails of the expedition. <br/><br/>The expedition's route and goal are cooperatively created at the beginning of play, followed by some quick character creation. Then play begins, consisting of scenes where your character is confronted by a hazard framed by another player. You use free-form narration to describe how you stylishly overcome the hazard and additional complications presented by the other player with a dice mechanic that borrows from Dogs in the Vineyard. You gain currency based on the number of dice you use in meeting the difficulty of the hazard, but the entire resolution must be narrated within a three-minute time limit - creating a tension between finishing and trying to tell an exciting and lengthier tale that is better rewarded.<br/><br/>The larger story is organized around the expedition log - a set of sheets where players can write down story elements they want to see used again. You get a currency reward for reusing other players' story elements in meaningful ways. The end result is a tale of exploration and adventure that is tightly organized despite being developed on the fly.<br/><br/>That's the game in a nutshell. The link above can point you to some playtest threads and an earlier version of the rules. I'm also happy to answer any questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73891/#Comment_73891" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T01:59:19+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  1:59AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>MI:666 </b>- Christian Hell exists and only the British Government stands between you and Hell. Be scared *wink*<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the interest in the game. Here goes on trying to explain it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Christians are right - Hell really does exist, and the Lords of Hell want their piece of the mortal plane now. The first breach on Earth was created by misguided students in England and triggered an emergency protocol that has existed within the darkest recesses of Whitehall since the days of the gunpowder plot. Imagine, if you will, the global reprecussions of such a revelation? In a world so perilously balanced between so many religions, this revelation would send the planet spiralling into an apocalypse of righteous panic and reprecussion. It is simply a Secret Never To Be Told.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter MI:666, the darkest of the British Governments blackest departments. No-one knows they exist, no-one knows how they get their funding. They exist within the system without ever touching it. Thirteen agents, three administrators and three Hangmen standing between Earth and Hell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats the backstory to the game. From there, the players can take it in any real direction they desire. I have seen it played out as an occult version of Spooks and I have seen it played out more akin to Hellboy. The system uses unfolding self-implemented character destiny - where the players decide when development revelations about their characters will be made to 'reveal' new facets. Each character also has four passions (Hate, Fear, Love, Desire) which are used as hooks for play as well as items that the Devils can use to tempt and manipulate the characters. Hopelessness and Secrecy play a large part as well. The 'Secret' weighs heavily on the characters as they can never risk sharing it with anyone. The Devils know this and they play on the fact, torturing the lives of the agents, trying to break them. Which leads to the hopelessness. Agents can never leave MI:666 - the secret is too precious. They join either through a sense of duty, outrage or coercion. They die at the hands of the Hangmen when they finally break and try to leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally there's a lot more to it than this, but it's still very much a work in progress. I'm trying to balance off creating an evocative background where a tale can be told in around 4-6 sessions which is fulfilling, without overly cramping the potential of the players to take it elsewhere if needed. Fingers crossed, with a lot of work over the next few weeks, I'll be putting together a demo game to run ad hoc at GenCon. Hopefully....<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister" title="ihmcallister"><img alt="ihmcallister" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ihmcallister">ihmcallister</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74043/#Comment_74043" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T13:36:31+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  1:36PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds cool eric, I especially like the use of time to make things feel tense.

This is the first I've spoken (or indeed written about it) about OGL outside of my battered notebook!<br><br>One Giant Leap is a game about space exploration, a pseudo-hard sci-fi game about astronauts travelling out into the solar system to visit other planets and finding weird stuff there. It's directly inspired by the likes of 2001: a space odyssey, Solaris and Sunshine, three sources of inspiration that immediately put paid to my hard sci-fi label. It's all realistic-ish science until they meet the weird shit, k?<br><br>The game is divided into three phases, which represent the various parts of the mission, and escalating tension and doom as they approach (and reach) their destination. I'm thinking along the lines of having a limited budget of scenes in each part of the mission, alongside mission log scenes, a la confessionals in InSpectres.<br><br/>Players create their own adversity by writing down skills that they want challenging during the mission on index cards. Then the other players grab the cards and write out an appropriate challenge. These challenge cards are placed face down in the middle of the table with d10s on them that players can count down at any time. When they hit 0 the challenge rears it's ugly head and the players have to deal with it.<br/><br/>Players also have various pools of counters or dice that represent nebulous things, such as composure, health and resources. To give themselves a bonus when overcoming challenges, or as part of the consequences for failure, they can spend these points. In doing so they have to write something down related to it, such as a skill or ability they possess or a resource the ship has onboard. Other players can then threaten or even destroy these exposed traits, a bit like things you hold dear in Grey Ranks.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure whether there will be a GM (Mission Control) or whether adversity will all be player generated. I'm hoping as the mission progresses the stress will pile on and things will start to fall apart of their own accord.

How does it work in play?<br/><br/>Very well, in my opinion. It wasn't working for a long time and then the Evil Hat guys did magic to it* and now it works. The key thing is you decide if you're going to Step Up or Say Uncle, and if you Step Up, you don't have any idea what you're going to do. You're just like, "Me! I'm gonna stop them!" The dice then tell you what happens. That look before you leap element is really important to the game and I'm enjoying it. There was a time where the craps thing was not as fun as just rolling dice to play craps and now it's definitely there. You've got strategy, you've got thematic reinforcement.<br/><br/>Does that answer your question? Did you want something more concrete or something different from that?<br/><br/>* I am kidding, Fred, Rob, and I worked together on it to make it work.

Sorry about that.<br/><br/>Here's how it works.<br/><br/>You get to the point in a scene where there's a conflict. One YO sets stakes, and The Authority sets counter-stakes. You pick a trait you're using to go at The Authority, then roll 2d6 and add them. This first roll is called The Throwdown, and it's possible to win the conflict right here. if you do though, you don't get any momentum toward winning the Operation.<br/><br/>For that roll, if you get at 7 or an 11, you win. If you get a 2, 3, or 12, The Authority wins. The Authority also has the ability to Tempt you at any time, of which more, later.<br/><br/>If you don't hit 2, 3, 7, 11, or 12, you go to a Tussle. You claim the number you rolled as The Target (let's say for example you rolled a 4, 4 is your Target). You now win on The Target (4). The Authority wins on 7, as well as any numbers Claimed by it due to the kind of character or force it is using in the conflict. More powerful (and rarer) C/Fs get 6 and 8, and less powerful ones go all the way down to 2 and 12. If The Youthful Offenders already have one of the two numbers The Authority claims, then The Authority gets only one of those.<br/><br/>Ok, so, right now the YO who rolled in the Tussle narrates how they would be winning if unopposed. It has to be an open thing, so it's like, you roll a 9 in your Throwdown, and now using your Fast Trait you say, "And I push the security guard, causing his arms to windmill. He's about to fall off the wall." The Authority then decides whether or not to push. The Security Guard here is a nobody, has 11 and 3. If it does push, it puts a Victory Point down and, using one of its Traits, says how it would win if unopposed. E.g., using the Security Guard's Viciousness of Violent, "The guard grabs you by the shirt as he starts to fall, either balancing himself or pulling you down with him."<br/><br/>The YOs decide if they're going to Say Uncle, or if someone's going to Stand Up. The person who elects to Stand Up <b>must not have a plan</b>. That person just says, "Me!" the YOs claim the number in question (9 in this case, but they already have that from the Throwdown), then that person rolls rolls. You look at the dice at that point. If it lands on an Authority number, (right now, 3, 11, 7), then The Authority wins stakes. If it lands on a YO number (right now, 9), then the YOs win. There's nothing The Authority can do at this point.<br/><br/>If the YOs hit a number not already owned (3, 7, 9, 11), then you go to another Tussle. Narratively the action gets jacked up even hotter and more dangerous.<br/><br/>If the YOs are going to automatically lose, The Authority can Tempt the YO and offer for them to win anyway by Selling Out one of their traits (it flips and becomes "evil", e.g., Cool becomes Trendy). Once a Trait is Sold, The Authority can snatch 1 auto-victory from the YOs per person per Operation.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>How's that? Too much?
