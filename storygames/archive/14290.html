Within that framework, it can still be a bit fuzzy, and what "positive outcome" and "negative outcome" mean is a decision that needs to be made on a case by case basis. When I played, it sometimes translated directly into whether something the character was trying would succeed or fail, sometimes we just roleplayed out the scene and I said, "yeah, that went poorly for my guy, I'll take a black die." Sometimes my guy got what he thought he wanted but it was obviously (from an audience POV) going to lead him into trouble, so I took the black die. If making this decision is your big hangup with the game, the easy solution would seem to be always choosing to establish rather than resolve your own scenes. If it's really the lack of structure that's getting to you, then Fiasco probably isn't the game for you. I can enjoy Fiasco, but I generally prefer more structured games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324522/#Comment_324522" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T20:33:52+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  8:33PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe I will try framing from now on!<br/>One more shot <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Thanks, Harley and Dan!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324523/#Comment_324523" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T20:43:10+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  8:43PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Virginia</cite>...

Eventually people got it, and we had more definite conflicts happening. In most games, IME, when you frame a scene, you're usually limiting it to where you are, who's there, what the atmosphere's like, and so on, so adding "What's the problem?" to that mix proved a bit challenging at first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324549/#Comment_324549" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-15T03:39:17+00:00" title="May 15, 2011  3:39AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2011 3:39AM by elkin.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My tip would be to play dickish characters, the sort you'd want to see fail.

This is one trope and often a tricky one. What's best for <i>you</i>, what's best for<i> your guy</i>, and what's best for the <i>emerging fiction</i> can be at cross purposes in various combinations. If you aren't sure, Establish all the time and you'll be fine. Your friends will tell you what's best for the fiction and probably what's best for your guy and you've taken care of yourself.<br/><br/>Also, sometimes the Setup tells you that:<br/><br/>1. Your guy is the hapless innocent. You are essentially a good guy in bad circumstances. This is easier, but as a player you still need to be mean to him. And you can never predict who - if anybody - this will be. <br/>2. The fiasco isn't about your guy. As a player, your first and sometimes only goal is to <i>make it about your guy.</i> This is perhaps the easiest position to be in, but once it is about your guy, you are back to one of the cases above, usually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324714/#Comment_324714" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T08:34:54+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  8:34AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey isn't there also a long-term angle to this, too?<br/><br/>About how many dice you end up with for the endgame?<br/><br/>Is picking all white dice whenever you can the best strategy in that sense, as well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324716/#Comment_324716" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T08:38:41+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  8:38AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2011 8:39AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Is picking all white dice whenever you can the best strategy in that sense, as well?</blockquote>\nLots of the same color is best, white or black.

And yet Fiasco works fine.  It does what it does. It gives power-to-influence-the-fictional-world to the players, but not to the characters.

I'm very much in the players are there to passionately advocate for their characters.  The GM (or other players) are there to bring hard adversity and the rules are there to resolve the clash.  Assuming that these elements are properly "charged" with emotionally engaging content the result will be a thematically punchy story.<br/><br/>The problem is you have no idea what kind of story.  For some reason a lot of people don't like playing like this.  They don't like being able to rely on genre or archetypes or any other pre-play assumptions about how the story is "supposed" to go.  The point is that at any given moment there is no "best" for the fiction (in terms out outcomes).  Each conflict simply leads to a *different* fiction.<br/><br/>In that regard Fiasco is much more like Call of Cthulhu than Sorcerer.  Pre-play we are committed to this being a disaster.  We don't know the details in terms of whom or when but we are committed to this being a train wreck.  Much like how in Call of Cthulhu if you aren't committed to going insane or dying in the name of pushing back the outer dark just a little longer than the game won't work.  For Fiasco, that means that at any given moment there is a "best" for the fiction choice - the choice that will push us closer to disaster.  <br/><br/>So yeah, if you're like me, the simplest thing to do is simply always setup your own scenes and let others resolve.  Then you don't have to worry about it and it's really not different than rolling dice.  For me, the problem comes in about the last 1/4 of the game.  Eventually there is only one color die left and now rather than playing the character from the gut, you're angling towards situations that make sense given the dice remaining.  I really don't like that shift.  The game loses all tension and energy at that point for me.  But fortunately, it's usually only a few scenes and usually only one scene for yourself.<br/><br/>The aftermath part is generally fun for me.  I don't mind system driven editorial constraints.  Particularly since the ones in Fiasco are so vague.<br/><br/>That's my take on it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324775/#Comment_324775" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T14:12:06+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  2:12PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>They don't like being able to rely on genre or archetypes or any other pre-play assumptions about how the story is "supposed" to go.</blockquote>\nDid you mean, "They <i>like</i> being able to rely on genre..."?<br/><br/>I don't think the problem for me stems from committing to it being a disaster - I really like Polaris, in part because it's tragic, not in spite of that.

I was trying to say, "They don't like NOT being able to..."<br/><br/>As for Polaris, the "fixed" outcomes issue is an interesting one.  Comparing Polaris vs. My Life with Master vs. Grey Ranks vs. Fiasco is interesting because they all involve a degree of fixed assumptions about where things are going.<br/><br/>I would suggest that in Polaris you are still largely fighting *for* your character against an unstoppable avalanche.  It's a bit like going into a Duel of Wits in Burning Wheel you know you mechanically can't win.  You aren't trying to win at that point, you're trying to score as large a compromise as you can.  You don't need to *make* tragedy happen in Polaris you're playing against a stacked desk you can't hope to win against.... but you fight anyways.<br/><br/>If you really and truly fought really hard to make things turn out "okay" in Fiasco I don't think that would work.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324802/#Comment_324802" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T16:08:23+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  4:08PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it considered bad form to try to 'win?'

Your friends should set things up so that taking a die of the color you want means that your character suffers mightily. If you can't figure out a way to make someone want to take the black die, it's probably a good time to pause and have a fast brainstorm - think back to all those Coen brothers movies where everyone would have been better off failing before they got so committed, think of a bad idea that might conceivably seem good at the time, think of the worst possible person to be sleeping with, think who the most damning witness would be, think about the kind of plan that appeals to stimulant abusers and winds up featured on <i>Cops</i>. Then go back and say, "OK, honestly, the capo's wife is pretty hot. And the capo is pretty old." Give them an excellent reason to want the black die, like an idea too terrible even for their idiot guy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324810/#Comment_324810" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T16:29:11+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  4:29PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elkin</cite>My tip would be to play dickish characters, the sort you'd want to see fail.</blockquote>\nTotally agree here.

Try playing the relationships hard, instead and see if that helps. Regarding adversity, it's everyone's job at the table to bring adversity to the relationships. Not just to the other characters.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Is it considered bad form to try to 'win?' To try to get all of one color die for yourself? By letting others set your scene and choosing dice for people with the intent that only the colors you want will be left for yourself?</blockquote>\nTo be honest, I only tried to "win" once and that was only to see what would happen. It was pretty unsatisfying having to worry about that. Now I just pick dice for me and others based on how the scene is playing out, and maybe on who seems to be short of dice. Sometimes if I see someone with three white dice already in front of them, I'll pile on and give them a fourth white die.<br/><br/>But really, looking that far ahead with the dice ends up like someone thinking ahead too much about how the story is going to progress. Try living in the moment and making the "right" (which from the character's perspective very well may be the "wrong") choice at any given opportunity. This is not a game that min-maxes well.<br/><br/>And definitely the end of the game, between the time where there are a few dice left and the Aftermath, can have a little system wonkiness. It's okay to squint your eyes at the dice and choose something that makes sense for the story or for the relationship. Don't get stuck in the "well, they gave me a white die" trap. People want to see the characters fuck up.

The guilty went unpunished and the stupid were venerated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lantern314" title="lantern314"><img alt="lantern314" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lantern314">lantern314</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324908/#Comment_324908" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-17T09:26:01+00:00" title="May 17, 2011  9:26AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The whole beauty of one shot games is that interesting pain is ok, but gamesmanship is ok. The first time I got this was playing in a With Great Power game with Kat at GenCon. At one point I had to let the proximate result be that my character accidentally destroyed a nursing home. That allowed for me to be able to make the ultimate result the transformation of the villain into a hero.<br/><br/>In Fiasco though I don't worry about the gamesmanship part. I just delight in the pain of my character, broken leg, strip club burned down, arrested for two crimes he didn't commit.

The first time I played to win, trying to get as many white dice as possible.<br/><br/>The second time I played to break even, just trying to get as many of one particular color as possible, but not getting TOO worried about it.<br/><br/>The third time, I played to lose.  I deliberately tried to stack up as many black dice as I had white dice.<br/><br/>I've got to say, for me playing to lose was the most fun option, and the one I'm probably going to be trying for in all my Fiasco games from now on. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
