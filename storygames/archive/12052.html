I have, but I don'y see how to make it work, and so I thought I'd come here to bask in the wisdom of crowds.<br/><br/>The parameters I have, which are perhaps flexible, are:<br/><br/>The game is to have <br/>a mystery theme<br/>up to 25 participants<br/>have participants aged 6-12<br/>last an hour<br/>be run by two or fewer adult staff.<br/><br/>The things I'm having trouble with are:<br/><br/>in a usual mystery LARP, you spread the clues among the players so that they interact to solve the mystery. With 25 players, that's a tall ask in one hour.<br/>Six year olds simply can't remember their character details, or play characters.<br/><br/>Can anyone see any sort of way to rescue this?  Even if it moves it out of RP and into How to Host a Murder type railroading?  The venue will be a large meeting room, with some props possible, and a data projector and speaker system. I've done some audioblogging, so I can record clues to be played.<br/><br/>Any advice is really welcome, because I don't want to say to the "Look, games are just too hard for us to do".  I did do an RPG project at the library before, but couldn't justify it on a staff hours to customers served basis, and I'd like to plant the seeds of getting more non-electronic gaming into my library service.<br/><br/>I might be able to instead split it into two games, one for youngers and one for tweens...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269760/#Comment_269760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T18:53:25+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  6:53PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How good are you at creating puzzles?

So is a treasure hunt, I think. They could have endless fun looking for additional clues.<br/><br/>You could also use the process of elimination that Cluedo uses. There's one murder weapon (say) and to find who it is, they must <i>eliminate</i> all the others. Or you must go round, asking people what they were doing between midnight and 3am, then find who had time to commit the murder (bit more complex). Perhaps, if you say a specific word, someone must reveal their clue.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, so I think the key is prewritten clues, which you <i>must</i> show to the other person under particular conditions. "This is a RED POISON BOTTLE. You must show it to anyone who shows you a MAGNIFYING GLASS." "This is an ALIBI CARD. Reveal it if someone says the word 'MIDNIGHT'".<br/><br/>Although you couldn't give six-year-old a detailed character, you could give them a character like "You're a cowboy" and let them do that. Give them hats or ask them to come in costume, perhaps.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269924/#Comment_269924" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T12:56:01+00:00" title="May  4, 2010 12:56PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Werewolf is awesome and kids <b>love</b> it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269926/#Comment_269926" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T12:59:55+00:00" title="May  4, 2010 12:59PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I forgot to add, there's a bunch of different variations on Werewolf(Mafia).  <br/>Some intended to last a bit longer, and some with more complicated rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269928/#Comment_269928" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T13:35:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  1:35PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caveat: WW/Mafia do NOT run well with more than about 15 people (three-wolf games). With a larger group, I'd advise splitting into two villages. And I don't think a Mafia-themed variant is the way to go with pre-teens, but I'm from the Southern US.<br/><br/>Possible draw-back is the cards--art and rules. If you're going to use any special characters, you need their rules on the card... and with young readers, that can mean they give away their role, if only by taking longer to read the special role's rules than folks who just need to see if they are bog-standard villagers or werewolves. That can be mitigated in two ways:<br/>* Every villager and werewolf card has unique art but the same basic text (villager or werewolf) so that the kids will tend to read them every time.<br/>* There are no non-special roles; rather, every role has some kind of rule effect (Alpha Wolf and Lone Wolf; every villager is one of the special roles).<br/><br/>The former is more of a trick. The latter can make for chaotic games (and might even break game balance, requiring you to have a higher number of werewolves).<br/><br/>There's a LOT of "theory" about werewolf at the Princeton Mafia site (just change the role names to suit).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269949/#Comment_269949" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T16:28:10+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  4:28PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2010 4:28PM by lordgoon.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yard Dog Press <a href="http://www.yarddogpress.com/Shirts_Murders_Etc.htm" rel="nofollow">publishes</a> some adult mysteries that satisfy your time and numbers constraints - might be a source of inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tinaa_oberoii" title="tinaa_oberoii"><img alt="tinaa_oberoii" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tinaa_oberoii">tinaa_oberoii</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269980/#Comment_269980" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T18:28:19+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  6:28PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ONE CAN FIND MANY MYSTERY GAMES IN AAfter Search.THERE'S A HUGE COLLECTION OF ABOUT 1000's OF GAMES.THERE ISN'T ANY LIMIT..AND YEAH THE SITE ALSO PROVIDES YOU WITH CHEATS AND WAYSTO SOLVE THE GAME.ANY GAME CAN BE MADE EASY FOR THOSE WHO PREFER A SHORT CUT AND YOU CAN FIND THE MOST INTERESTING GAMES OUT THERE                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_270018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270018/#Comment_270018" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T03:03:40+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  3:03AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2010 3:07AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Timothy</cite>I might be able to instead split it into two games, one for youngers and one for tweens...</blockquote>6-8 years old children, and those of 9-12, are divided by reading-ability when it comes to participating in such a game. So it might be a good idea to split them.<br/><br/>My ideas:<br/><br/>Make <b>the preteens</b> (9-12) a game where they play themselves. Set it to the future, when a sickness of the mind has struck all adults on earth, making them into walking dolls with fragments of understanding (makes it fun to play the adults, and makes it fun for the children to question them). Most adults are dead, of course, and the children are gathered in a library to find out what to do (and there, lo and behold; are an adult librarian). Let the children try to find some cure, and give them notes with "experiences" they've had, that might set them on a path of discovery in the library. And let the discovery of the cure be a celebration of their smartness and courage.<br/><br/>Make <b>the young ones</b> (6-8) a fairy-tale game, where they play knights and witches gathered to find and kill a horrendous dragon. Make it a game where all of them get to set one scene in the story (the more shy need help setting a scene, but most of them will do so easily). They may encounter and fight, or befriend, any fiend and foe, but THE DRAGON  may only be introduced by the adults. Make it a joint story where chaos reigns supreme, and where the knights/witches win in the end. But what an ending; let the dragon ROAR and spit FLAMES and SWALLOW some of them whole (to be rescued when the dragon is slayed), and DIE HORRENDOUSLY WITH A LOT OF TRASHING!!!<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270040/#Comment_270040" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T07:01:42+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  7:01AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drawing from my experiences with children, the 12 year olds aren't likely to enjoy the same game as the 6 year olds. If you are pressed for manpower, you can easily recruit the 12 year olds as NPCs and co-GMs; if you take a few minutes to talk to them prior to the game, most of them will appreciate the trust and responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nA rudimentary game will be to split the kids into 3-5 groups, with each group having a different mystery to solve, which in turn is part of a larger mystery. Each of the NPCs presents them with a challenging activity: one might ask them to do a short scavenger hunt, another might ask them to memorize and recite a complicated password, and so on. Upon the successful completion of the task, the group receives a clue, and move on to the next NPC, if one is available, or to a special bonus task if no NPCs are free.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end, gather the groups, and have each present its solution to each of the smaller mysteries. The answer to the larger mystery will then be revealed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270274/#Comment_270274" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T13:12:42+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  1:12PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2010 1:17PM by Nathan_H.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I've run werewolf, it's the preteen girls that love it.<br/>They play it fast &amp; loose, and enjoy it enough to demand it every game night.<br/>Your results may certainly vary.<br/>Oh, and I'd wait to introduce the special roles(the ones besides villagers and werewolves)'til they've gotten the gist of the basic game.  <br/>I think the seer/oracle takes a bit more strategy then the villager or werewolf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270275/#Comment_270275" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T13:20:59+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  1:20PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ya know, something like <a href="http://memento-mori.com/online-store/action-castle/" rel="nofollow">Action Castle</a> might be pretty fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
