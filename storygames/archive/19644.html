As Khimus commented <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19635/runica-publishing-is-alive#Item_1" rel="nofollow">here</a>, the first Runica Publishing games are now available. Among them you will be able to find <i>Nanodungeon</i>, a nanogame that I wrote and I would like to share with you all.<br/><br/>But, what is Nanodungeon about? <br/><br/>It is a free nanogame which attempts to reduce the dungeon-crawl experience to its bare components. You will find in it random setting and event generation, typical character classes like warrior, thief and magic user, and an archenemy you will help define. <br/>But then again, it's a Story Game! The game does not require GM, does not have a traditional character creation, and it's mechanics focus more on the party's internal conflicts than on individual actions. It is not about telling if the warrior manages to defeat the orcs in combat: it is about defining if the other characters sacrifice themselves to help him or if they betray him to benefit. <br/>Anyway, that is a brief summary of the game, which will be available to download <a href="http://editorialrunica.blogspot.com.ar/p/nanogames.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <br/><br/>So, what do you think? We would really welcome your feedback, and I hope you enjoy your next Nanodungeon session!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436318/#Comment_436318" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T11:31:21+00:00" title="August  3, 2014 11:31AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks really cool. I like the angle of this design very much, and it sounds like fun.<br/><br/>1. How long does it take to play, and is there a minimum or maximum number of players?<br/><br/>2. You might consider having this edited by someone with good English skills. There are quite a few confusing sentences.<br/><br/>Most importantly:\n<blockquote><br/>You win using an amount of pieces thrice greater than <br/>the number of heroes. If you lose all of your gold or <br/>equipment, narrate your death at the end of the round. <br/>Each death increases by one the pieces needed to win.</blockquote>\nThis is confusing to me. What does it mean when you say "using an amount of pieces"? Does that mean pieces of equipment, and what does "using" mean? That they were burned/lost in the confrontation, or just bid by the players?<br/><br/>And does the last line mean that the number of pieces needed is equal to 3 x number of surviving players + 1 per dead player? Or 3 x number of players + 1 per dead player?<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing! This is a really thought-provoking design, I really like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dragonfly" title="Dragonfly"><img alt="Dragonfly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dragonfly">Dragonfly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436356/#Comment_436356" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-04T06:09:08+00:00" title="August  4, 2014  6:09AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your help <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>! I will answer your questions in order: <br/><br/>1) It takes approximately 20 minutes per player, with scenes of about two and a half minutes. On the number of players: it has a minimum of three participants (to cover three types of character), but it doesn't necessarily have a limit. I have played it with six people, and it worked fine. <br/><br/>2) The pieces used in the final battle are only pieces of equipment. And every time you bid equipment pieces, those pieces will be consumed during the turn of the fight against the Necromancer. If you find a better wording for this, we'd love to read it!<br/><br/>3) In case of the death of one of the characters, you have to add one to the total required. If defeating your enemy took you 9 equipment pieces, it will now take 10. If it took 12, it will now take 13. And so on. <br/><br/>Finally, proofreaders are always welcome in Runica Publishing.

And you check that at the end of the second round? Is that correct?</blockquote>\nYup, that's about it.\n<blockquote>Also, do the players bid pieces secretly or in the open?</blockquote>\nThey do that secretly. That way you can do some scheming... Will you spend all your equipment in the first round, or will you wait for the second? What do you think the other players will do? Will you bet all your equipment, giving your life in battle, but granting extra gold that might turn you into a legend?\n<blockquote>Why do you roll three dice for the Dungeon roll, instead of just a single die? I don't see anything particularly different about the options nearer the 1 or the 6, they all seem like good choices.</blockquote>\nWe use the tree dice roll on Dungeon roll to assure certain thematic mood. That way, 3s and 4s are the more emblematic places in a goblin cave, or in a dark elves citadel. 2s and 5s often give you clues about the presence of the Necromancer. And 1s and 6s are just for colour.\n<blockquote>"If any one result is repeated, take it," might be better phrased as something like, "If you roll doubles, use that result."</blockquote>\nI might take that into account. Thanks!\n<blockquote>I might try this sometime, it's a pretty interesting and elegant design.</blockquote>\nI certainly hope you do! And please, come back and tell us how it turned out.\n<blockquote>It has some interesting parallels to Zombie Cinema, I think.</blockquote>\nMmh, I haven't read it yet, but I'll surely take a look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dragonfly" title="Dragonfly"><img alt="Dragonfly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dragonfly">Dragonfly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436457/#Comment_436457" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-05T09:39:12+00:00" title="August  5, 2014  9:39AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and by the way!
