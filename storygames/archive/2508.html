Funny everytime I read it, like Ninjas had secretly attacked the server and killed the forum or something. ^_^<br/><br/>M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57918/#Comment_57918" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T15:08:12+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  3:08PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Naw, it's my host.  In the past few months I was moved from a "slow mysql server" to a "fast mysql server, apparently co-hosted with folks who fill up their databases and explode shit, causing the server to be rebooted at least once a week".  I'm seeing if they can buy me something shiny for my troubles.<br/><br/>Just some info so you know what's going on next time:<br/><br/>"Fatal, Non-Recoverable Error" == Generic error with DB, server, etc.<br/><br/>"Gateway timeout" or the like: Mysql server is down or problematic. Usually during a reboot. Expect the system to be back in a few minutes.<br/><br/>"Error 25" - Can't connect to database. Usually means that something exploded on another account and they're rebooting the mysql server to clear it. Usually goes away after 5-60 minutes.<br/><br/>"Error 28" - This is a new one. Some other account on my mysql server fills up the DB, takes every last available byte. Knocks out the rest of us.  Usually this goes away after an hour or two, because first the provider has to be made aware that there's an issue, then do something about it.<br/><br/>Hope that helps.<br/><br/>Anytime I notice an issue that I think will be around for more than 10 minutes, I tend to edit the front page of Story Games, www.story-games.com to give a status update.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58169/#Comment_58169" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-27T20:37:48+00:00" title="February 27, 2007  8:37PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here I thought this thread would be about <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?referrerid=21316&amp;t=291782" rel="nofollow">fail-fast</a> game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
