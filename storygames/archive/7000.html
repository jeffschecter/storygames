My Fiancee loves the setting, but we'd never played it because the rules were...well, dusty.  And the whole Points of Light theme to D&amp;D4 is exactly what Earthdawn was about. So, I'm looking forward to playing in Earthdawn using a nicely streamlined system.  But, since I know almost nothing about the theme of Earthdawn, maybe Clyde is right and it's the wrong system:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

Yes - many powers and abilities in the rules are aided by miniature play.<br/><br/>But nowhere does my imagination for story NEED to be looking down at a table and moving pieces around.<br/><br/>I am loving the style of D&amp;D4, which in my humble opinion brings back old school original D&amp;D to a nice clean mix of modern rule styles, complete with many Indie type rule functions that aid in storytelling and group dynamic.<br/><br/>I feel that with the addition of game campaigns (from WotC or other companies) that D&amp;D4 will be a vibrant set of rules to play any amount of ROLL-play and ROLE-play.

Talk about products in need of a recall.  Well, it's good to hear that the negative aspects might be more to do with cries of heresy than an actual falling short. I wasn't sure if maybe if Earthdawn was known for something in particular (like perhaps intrique and moral quandries) that D&amp;D might not bring to the table (of course, even if that were the case, the combination of Skill Challenges and extra systems in AoL4 could bring that to the table).

I was just thinking about the uniqueness of the stepped rules system for the original Earthdawn, But then thinking more about it, it actually seems like a natural, and pretty hot fix.<br/><br/>I mean, you can pretty much play 4e in Earthdawn with little deep-level conversion, I think. <br/><br/>Sky Pirate, Weaponsmith and Nethermancer will be the hardest to convert, I think. maybe Beast Master, too. Thing is, in the few games I've played of it, these classes never really came up too much (I've seen Nethermancer more than the others). Troubador and the like we'll probably have to wait for those classes to be filled out in future PHBs.<br/><br/>Swordmaster is probably a Ranger, but where "two blades" is simply replaced by "One Blade, just make two attacks with it" (or "Yeah, or you might wield two weapons, if that's your Thing"). I think most of the spellcasters (Elementalist, Nethermancer) could be replaced by either a Wizard or a Warlock (player's choice), just giving the effects to the class abilities: Nethermancer Warlock would be like, "I hit you with an <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">infernal</span> death blast", etc.<br/><br/>And then of course you'd have to add maybe a general Art skill, which all players must be Skilled in, which represents some art (pottery, painting, dance, etc).<br/><br/>Most of all, the setting was pretty ripe with stuff that basically makes 4e what it is: Powerful dudes kicking in doors in ancient tombs, killing things, saving the day, gettin' loot, exploring mysteries. Sounds pretty much like 4E to me. Only now you do most of the beat-downs on a top-down map instead of sort of scattered across a half-drawn map.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155748/#Comment_155748" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-09T20:39:14+00:00" title="July  9, 2008  8:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know nothing of Earthdown!<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I'm getting no love from Wikipedia:<br/>\n<br/>\nEarthdawn lovers: <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does Earthdawn do that 4e might not do?

Basically, earthdawn magic items level up with you, growing more powerful as your story grows. It's mechanically easy to implement, so I see no problems there.<br/><br/>It will need an art skill (or some sort of stand in), as someone noted.  One key element of the setting is that demons cannot truly create, and the way for a traveler to prove he's not a demon is to demonstrate his art.  It's not hugely important mechanically, but it's a very big deal in terms of flavor.<br/><br/>A few races to add, no big deal there.  The system was level based, so again, no great cognitive jump.<br/><br/>As Andy notes, I feel like I could run it pretty well with the existing D&amp;D classes. You lose some specific fiddliness, like with magic, and certain classes liek the sky pirate and smith would be in strange positions.  But they really have some leeway with this, and I suspect it's an open question how many new classes they'll create.  It could be anywhere from zero to all, depending upon how happy or unhappy they are with the spirit of 4e. <br/><br/>And hopefully it adds cool ass airship rules.  Because, man. Airships.

One of the interesting things about 4e is that because classes are so power driven, it is much easier to create new magical classes than new martial ones, if only because the special effects are much easier to justify.  This dovetails really well with the core principal of Earthdawn that all PC's are magic users, even if they're not necessarily spellcasters.  (For those unfamiliar with this idea, it means the fighting guy is magically fighty, the sneaky guy is magically sneaky and so on).<br/><br/>This, in turn, is one of the reasons this is such a great approach for Earthdawn. Because they have such solid IP, they can practically build the game from the ground up, and if they're feeling ambitious they could do it from scratch. That is, they could make a game that is less grid dependent or with different roles than the default for D&amp;D, since those things really emerge from the way the powers are designed.  Of course,  whether or not that's how they want to approach it is totally up to them.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - And yeah, the levelled magic items really point very clearly to how trivial Earthdawn style magic items  this would be to implement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155821/#Comment_155821" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T10:56:33+00:00" title="July 10, 2008 10:56AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>The magic users are going to be the most curious rub, because they ultimately ask the question of how how much give there is between the concepts and the old rules.

Like Most of it originates from the Twisting Nether, realm of the demons. Arcane magic was given to the world by the gods (or titans) and is so corrupting that the elves fragmented over its use (the night elves abandoned it, those who stuck with it became high elves). Divine magic comes from interdimensional beings, one of which is enslaved by the high elves (now blood elves) in their thirst for more power. Then there's the druidic Emerald Dream dn shamanistic Earth Mother with all sorts of backstory I'm not clear on. All these story hooks are occasionally used in quests and dungeons, but mechanically there's no difference - they all use a mana bar.<br/><br/>So, I wonder, without even considering if there's a mechanical way to drive it in 4E, what is it about Earthdawn magic that makes for interesting story hooks?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155851/#Comment_155851" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T12:27:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2008 12:27PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>what is it about Earthdawn magic that makes for interesting story hooks?</blockquote>\n...not much, from what I recall. I never really read all the supplement background-book-throw-it-on-your-shelf-and-never-use-it material.

One of the interesting things about 4e is that because classes are so power driven, it is much easier to create new magical classes than new martial ones, if only because the special effects are much easier to justify.  This dovetails really well with the core principal of Earthdawn that all PC's are magic users, even if they're not necessarily spellcasters.  (For those unfamiliar with this idea, it means the fighting guy is magically fighty, the sneaky guy is magically sneaky and so on)..</blockquote>\n<br/>I've talked about these ideas a great deal for Earthdawn between the threads I pitched for translating Earthdawn on RPGnet and talking to some of my players about the idea...  we came to a couple of ideas on these things.  It's only in our opinions, I could totally be happy if they go another way - these ideas just seem like the most simple or clean way to go.<br/><br/><br/>I came to the conclusion that overall when translating Earthdawn to D&amp;D4 the most clean thing you could do would be to choose your "battles" or rather pick the points that you think will make the best bang for your buck to design from the ground up.  From my perspective there are many things that you can translate into D&amp;D4 terms that donot "shoehorn" but rather fit nicely into the D&amp;D4 scheme without sacrificing any Earthdawn COOL...  with that here are my thoughts...<br/><br/>On making new classes.<br/>While I know classes could be a neat "bang" to create from scratch, I'd suggest that it might be easier for players NEW to Earthdawn to go with using the D&amp;D4 classes straight-away and building "Build Options" into each Class as written in D&amp;D4.  For example:  looking at the RANGER class, D&amp;D4 lists the Build Options: Archer ranger, two-blade ranger.  These are basically suggestions to maximize utility and give new players a hint at building their character.  <br/>So rather than make brand new classes for Earthdawn, I'd suggest that you might build the Earthdawn Disciplines as new "Build Options" under the existing classes.  We've noted several of these on the RPGnet thread but the perfect example for Earthdawn is RANGER: Build Option: Archer.  and so on...<br/><br/>What about Earthdawn's uniqueness you say?<br/>My thought is that building Disciplines as Build Options keeps the connection to Earthdawn but allows non-Earthdawn folks to immediately understand the options for Player Classes without the learning curve.  The uniqueness comes back in full swing with the NEW powers you could build within each class to choose from that stack on top of the standard class options.  So rather than building a bunch of brand new classes, you'd just have simple additions that would minimize the learning curve yet still remain true to Earthdawn.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite><br/>This, in turn, is one of the reasons this is such a great approach for Earthdawn. Because they have such solid IP, they can practically build the game from the ground up, and if they're feeling ambitious they could do it from scratch. That is, they could make a game that is less grid dependent or with different roles than the default for D&amp;D, since those things really emerge from the way the powers are designed.  Of course,  whether or not that's how they want to approach it is totally up to them.</blockquote>\n<br/>True regarding the solid IP, but for the target market do you really think the idea is to diverge so much from D&amp;D4's standard approach?  I understand that one of the big negatives D&amp;D4-haters note is the reliance on the grid and tactics...  but I maintain that this bit of the system does not dictate play style... with the D&amp;D4 rules you can still get a great flavorful role-play from the style of Earthdawn either though you use the excellent tactic systems of D&amp;D4.  So I don't think building the game from the ground up is at all necessary.<br/>I doubt RedBrick's point of going with the Age of Legend for D&amp;D4 is to make a new revolutionary "fix" to D&amp;D4,  because -frankly- D&amp;D4 isn't broken.  I feel that their goal is to expand Earthdawn's appeal into a more mass market of new-comers that are drawn in for the new excitement of D&amp;D4  combined with those that are in the hobby that have never tried Earthdawn but are interested in a new cool setting for D&amp;D  combined with those that know Earthdawn and love the new D&amp;D4.<br/>I doubt that RedBrick is looking to make a new game - but rather take a great game and give options that make the flavor sprinkle that is distinctly Earthdawn.  Hence my thought on choosing the "bang" points that make up new rule points whole cloth vs. making great new additions on the top of current D&amp;D4 standard rules.<br/><br/><br/>To me, making new classes for the Disciplines isn't one of those "bang" points. But making new powers to fit the class build options would be.  But again - I don't see that it couldn't be.  I'd be happy either way.<br/><br/>**continued**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155854/#Comment_155854" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T12:33:29+00:00" title="July 10, 2008 12:33PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite><br/>PS - And yeah, the levelled magic items really point very clearly to how trivial Earthdawn style magic items  this would be to implement.</blockquote>\n<br/>Unlike my thought on creating Disciplines as "Build Options" HERE is where I think new addition Earthdawn rules could really make a BANG.  Whereas the core classes might be one of the areas that you'd want to leave "clean" (rather than making all new classes)  -  since Classes are such a staple of D&amp;D4 core.  Magic Items are a COOL point that aren't an "out in front" rule that could be exploited for full on ground up creation of new unique rules for Earthdawn.<br/><br/>I'd theorized that you could take the existing D&amp;D4 magic item rules and build onto that "level up" idea that they hint at, creating the unique flavor for Earthdawn legends.  For Example...<br/><br/>There are no "Craft" skills in D&amp;D4 anymore.  I've noted in another thread point that I don't feel creating a new skill for Crafting is important enough to alter since D&amp;D4 clearly suggests that things that aren't "important" enough for players to worry about should be "hand-waved" until it becomes obvious the game needs to deal with it.  That can be seen with this note on encumberance rules:<br/><br/>"Adventurers carry a lot of gear. When that quantity becomes extreme, it might be enough to slow you down and otherwise hamper your capabilities. The amount you carry should rarely be an issue, and you don\u2019t need to calculate the weight your character is hauling around unless it\u2019s likely to matter."  --PHB p.222<br/><br/>Likewise I'd suppose that Crafting and other skills that have been culled from D&amp;D4 can/should be thoguht of in this way.  <br/>For Earthdawn I understand Crafting Skill's importance but I'd suggest that adding a new skill would be a stop-gap that isn't the best solution.  In fact SINCE crafting is so very important, I'd suggest that it be treated with the relevance it deserves by using other GREAT rules of D&amp;D4 to caputure the importance and flavor necessary for Earthdawn.  It also allows players of D&amp;D4 to consider new interesting ways to USE the standard D&amp;D4 rules they might not have considered before -  as opposed just having a new "Craft" skill bypasses that creative solution and short-cuts the problem.<br/><br/>So... what rules am I talking about for Crafting that is so important in identifying non-Horror tainted folk as well as the "Thread Weaving" for determining the Legends and Names behind magical items?<br/>D&amp;D4's RITUAL and SKILL CHALLENGE rules!<br/><br/>Both could be used in interesting ways for a combination that would answer both problems uniquely for Earthdawn as well as taking an existing cool point in the D&amp;D4 rules and giving players unfamiliar with Earthdawn a new spin on using D&amp;D4 rules they might not have considered otherwise.<br/><br/>Skill Challenges would elevate the cool factor of the need for proving that you're not a Horror by doing a crafting project  OR  on the other side for a PC watching an NPC to see if they are a Horror making it an "encounter" rather than a simple one-roll check...  which inherently deflates the drama/excitement of the situation and importance of investigating someone's being able to craft or proving that you can craft  -  and are NOT Horror tainted.<br/>The Ritual rules could be mixed in as a part of the Skill Challenge by making the Ritual rules into a unique translation of "Craft" rules.  <br/><br/>Okay...  since I seem to have gone into a "preachy - here's my idea" point...  (unintentionally)  I'll wrap up with an example to show what I'm talking about...  That'll be next post after I create on... heheh...  fun fun.<br/><br/><br/>I'm always open to ideas though.  I'm never one to say "my way" is the right way when/if someone has a better solution.  these are just my opinions until "the group" finds a better solution.  In this case "the group" being all us fans excited for RedBrick and Earthdawn!  This'll also be a NICE help (for me and my group)  if we end up trying to play an Earthdawn campaign before RedBrick publishes Earthdawn for D&amp;D4 - unless my group were to be part of the playtest gang!

Crafting is vitally important to the denizens of the Age of Legend, one skill check does not do justice to the importance. Crafting combines various skills that culminate in the creation unique to adepts. To craft, you need to have studied with a master or developed your skills from a book or a scroll containing it. A craft book or teacher open your ability to create one or more crafts that you can use as often and as many times as you like, as long as you can spare the time and the components to perform the craft. A craft scroll contains a single ritual, and you can perform the ritual from that scroll only once. After that, the magic contained in the scroll is expended, and the scroll turns to dust. Anyone can use a craft scroll to perform the ritual it contains, as long as the appropriate components are expended.<br/><br/>Before you can perform a craft, you need to acquire the knowledge of the craft passed down from the masters through a teacher or book that contains it and master the craft, or you need to acquire a craft ritual scroll.<br/><br/>Owning a craft book or having scene a craft being created isn\u2019t enough to let you perform the craft yourself. You must first master a craft by studying it for 8 uninterrupted hours.  You must meet two requirements to master a craft. You must have the Craft feat of the craft you wish to develop (similar to Ritual Caster feats), and your level must equal or exceed the craft\u2019s level (based on the intricacy and artistic level of the craft). If you meet those requirements and spend 8 hours studying a ritual, you can add it to your list of mastered crafts. There\u2019s no limit to the number of crafts you can master.<br/><br/>To perform a craft that you have mastered, you spend a certain amount of time (specified in the craft description) performing various actions appropriate to the craft. The specific activities required aren\u2019t described in most craft descriptions; they\u2019re left to your imagination. Each craft specifies the cost of the components you need. If a craft requires a skill check or challenge, the check usually determines the craft\u2019s effectiveness and artistic value. Even if the check result is low, a craft usually succeeds, but if the result is high, you can usually achieve better effects and artistic value.<br/><br/>Primary Skills:  A craft\u2019s key skill determines the type of components required to perform the craft, and if a craft requires a skill check, the key skill is used for the check. If this entry ends with \u201c(no check),\u201d then the craft does not require a skill check. If a craft has more than one key skill, you choose which skill to use. Your choice determines both the components you use and the skill you use for any checks required by the craft. Unless a craft\u2019s description says otherwise, you make your skill check when you finish performing a craft. You can\u2019t take 10 on one of these skill checks.<br/><br/><br/>Skill Challenges <br/>A skill challenge is an encounter in which your skills, rather than your combat abilities, take center stage. In contrast to an obstacle that requires one successful skill check, a skill challenge is a complex situation in which you must make several successful checks, often using a variety of skills, before you can claim success in the encounter. <br/><br/>Noncombat encounters focus on skills, utility powers, and your own wits (not your character\u2019s), although sometimes attack powers can come in handy as well. Such encounters include dealing with traps and hazards, solving puzzles, and a broad category of situations called skill challenges. A skill challenge occurs when exploration or social interaction becomes an encounter, with serious consequences for success or failure. <br/><br/>The difference between a combat challenge and a skill challenge isn\u2019t the presence or absence of physical risk, nor the presence or absence of attack rolls and damage rolls and power use. The difference is in how the encounter treats PC actions. Skill challenges can account for all the action in a particular encounter, or they can be used as part of a combat encounter to add variety and a sense of urgency to the proceedings. The Basics To deal with a skill challenge, the player characters make skill checks to accumulate a number of successful skill uses before they rack up too many failures and end the encounter. <br/>Example: The PCs seek to find a Horror believed to be hiding within a Bazaar by carefully watching the vendors and customers. Achieving six successes means they spot the person not displaying the craft ability or appreciation inherent in beings not Horror tainted. Accruing three failures before achieving the successes, however, indicates that the Horror has escaped the Bazaar before the adepts find it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155884/#Comment_155884" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T13:39:01+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  1:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brew Ales and Wine<br/>Liquids brew and bubble, coalescing the barely and hops into a form you can drink, commonly thought of as a social lubricant. <br/><br/>In this skill challenge, the PC is attempting to create a brew of ale passed down from his ancestor\u2019s.  It involves research in the journals of your ancestor\u2019s notes on this art craft as well as  attempts to use your own experiences and knowledge of natural flavors to blend your unique tastes into the brew. The challenge might take a matter of hours, or even days crafting the most tasty drink. You create a brew of Ale or Wine passed down generation to generation. The brew\u2019s component cost is equal to the price of the brew\u2019s potency you create.<br/><br/>Setup: To develop the brew, the PC must follow the recipe of their forefathers and find new ingredients to test for creating their unique blend.  This may also involve speaking with other brew masters or searching the area for interesting herbs.<br/><br/>Level: Equal to the level of artistic difficulty that the PC wishes to create. Complexity: 3 (requires 8 successes before 4 failures).<br/>Category: Water + Earth <br/>Time: 1 hour minimum <br/>Duration: Permanent until consumed <br/>Component Cost: Special <br/>Market Price:  2 sp per pitcher of Ale;  5 gp per bottle of wine<br/>Primary Skills:  Nature, History, Diplomacy, Arcana <br/><br/>Nature (moderate DCs):  You seek out flavors and herbs that will aid in the crafting of your brew, searching for the components of the recipe as well as finding new ingredients to add your own unique blend.  Success means you\u2019ve found proper ingredients and come one step closer to fruition.  Failure indicates the local area does not have the ingredients needed for the brew, meaning you must seek other means of finding the ingredients such as Diplomacy or Streetwise for tracking down the components from local bazaars or stores.<br/><br/>History (moderate DCs): You delve into historic recipes of your ancestors and other brew masters to further your research. Success brings the research one step closer to fruition. Failure indicates that this particular line of research ran into a dead end or an unavailable ingredient.<br/><br/>Diplomacy (moderate DCs): You visit a brew master or potion scholar, hoping to curry favor and learn a useful bit of information that will bring you one step closer to discovering the secrets of brewing. This approach requires a character to spend gold pieces equal to the level of the challenge. You pay the cost, whether the check results in a success or a failure. A success provides a +2 bonus to the next Nature check or History check, as well as counting as a success for completing the challenge. A failure likewise provides a \u20132 penalty, as well as counting toward the completion of the challenge.<br/><br/>Arcana (moderate DCs): You visit libraries and sift through vast stacks of lore in search of a useful bit of knowledge. Success brings the research one step closer to fruition. Failure indicates that this particular line of research ran into a dead end.<br/><br/>Success: The PC creates the brew with the Difficulty Class resulting the potency and artistic value of the flavor.<br/><br/>Failure: The PC uncovers flawed or incomplete information or fails in their creation of a tasty beverage. As they proceed forward, they operate at a disadvantage. Perhaps the ingredients are lost from improper mixing or other accident in the process. Or they might translate the recipe incorrectly, leading to all kinds of mistakes and misadventures from an overly addicting drink to a poisonous concoction                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155903/#Comment_155903" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T14:35:36+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  2:35PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>what is it about Earthdawn magic that makes for interesting story hooks?</blockquote>\n...not much, from what I recall. I never really read all the supplement background-book-throw-it-on-your-shelf-and-never-use-it material. In the book, it just seemed that there were different types of magic (Elemental, Death/Nether, Arcane) and that was that. There were other interesting stories that happened in the setting, like where the Blood Elves came from and the like, but nothing really tied to magic that I can recall. I might be misremembering though.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Most of the magic in Earthdawn was tied to threads, threadweaving, pattern items, and true names. Smart PCs (just speaking strategically, not even story wise) wouldn't ever go in against a strong foe until they'd found his true name, some of his pattern items, woven threads to them, researched his magical protections and found the ways around them. All of those things, finding names, discovering history, learning the human stories of their enemies, very easily moved into making stories. That some types of magic could corrupt the threads you'd tied to someone else to gain power over them, allowing them or horrors to gain power over you, made it all the more juicy. <br/><br/>Earthdawn spells were, more or less, just spells. But the threads, named items, pattern stuff, and name rituals all were awesome for story hooks. Most of that can probably be ported to 4th Ed rules, it'll just take a little work and thought. <br/><br/>As for the general topic, I think the whole thing is going to depend largely on how much effort goes into the back end. A simple "Play Earthdawn with the Players Handbook" will probably lose a lot of the magic that is Earthdawn. But a good, well designed and playtested game could probably give a lot that is the best of both worlds and maybe breathe some new life into the IP. I mean, after all, much as Earthdawn had many rules for things other than combat, the most detailed and extensive parts of the rules were those for combat, and fighting made up a big chunk of game play, and getting read for fights with research and rituals the other big chunk. All those things can be done with 4th ed -- especially if they fix the rituals rules. <br/><br/>P.S. Andy, no Skyraiders? WTF? I've never played an Earthdawn game without at least one Skyraider PC. Skyraiders are the dopest shit in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
