And Heroquest does a great job of bringing the experience of episodic adventure stories (in film, comics, and narrative) to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that I need a little more structure than that provide by the pass/fail rhythm, or Heroquest 2.0\u2019s advice on pacing a session by using strategically employed resolution methods. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have come up with my own scene economy and Narrator-moves to run an episodic game of intrigue and rebellion in the canonical Glorantha setting of Pavis, a city hewn out of the body of a giant statue animated by a mighty enchanter. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want to give into arbitrary decisions on resistance levels, the scale of threats to the PCs and their goals, the long-term fate of the setting, or the proximity of the rebellion, civil war, and apocalyptic Hero Wars.  I do not want to engage in the (benign?) railroading that the current iteration of the rules tacitly endorse and which many players still come to expect from a story-heavy role playing game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I have to manage an ensemble cast of 8 PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe previous session\u2019s determination of Crises to be faced in the current session activates latent potentials from setting creation.  Each of the clan\u2019s resources (Magic, War, Peace, Harmony, Morale) is associated with two of the factions from the setting, one faction being friendly or allied with the clan, one from an enemy, rival, or other out group.   Both factions need the resource and are prepared to engage the PCs to get access to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is the narrator\u2019s job to make the two factions\u2019 claims to the contested resource matter to the players.  The challenge is to make the enemy or out group\u2019s claim on the resource compelling.  The Narrator MUST think of compelling reasons why the PCs would choose to give precious resources to members of an out group and find ways to get their clan to go along.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players are to push to aid the clan generated in setting creation: strengthen resources, transform accidental growth in resources into a permanent improvement, make up for losses, augment the clan\u2019s magic, alter the clan\u2019s values or rituals.  Each session\u2019s long Extended Contest will deliver changes to the PCs AND to the resource which has been the centre of the evening\u2019s activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the genre is high fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy GM-principles<br/>\n* Make Pavis seem real<br/>\n* Make the Lunar occupation feel uncomfortable<br/>\n* Give the players chances to be heroic<br/>\n* Put their clan at risk, but give players the opportunity to intervene<br/>\n* Allow players the chance to shape the setting through rituals, heroquesting, and shaping the clan\u2019s relationship to other groups<br/>\n* maintain the credibility of a world divided into the mundane, exceptional, heroic, superheroic, and the divine<br/>\n<br/>\nInputs into a Session<br/>\n* current status of the clan\u2019s resources (numbers determined at setting creation)<br/>\n* current crises growing out of resource fluctuation (fictional positioning but relevant crises were determined by rolls at the end of previous session)<br/>\n* Loresheets \u2013 elements of the setting that players paid for with Hero Points at the end of last session \u2013 are reviewed: the GM is to strive to include elements from the players\u2019 chosen lore sheets in this session, failure to do so means giving 1 Hero Point to each player whose chosen Loresheet was overlooked. \u201cThank You\u201d to Weapons of the Gods for tying together player interest in the setting, canonical matter, and in-game currency in their Lore Sheets concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nPre-Game<br/>\n1) Review previous session\u2019s activities<br/>\n2) GM specifies the kind of crisis being faced and the factions involved<br/>\n3) Lore Sheet review \u2013 specifying which ones are active<br/>\n4) Clockwise, each player highlights the Rune of Interest on neighbouring player\u2019s sheet (a use of this rune means it gets advanced by 1 at the end of the session)<br/>\n5) Narrator highlights 1 Ability of interest on each player\u2019s sheet (a use of this ability means it gets advanced by 1 at the end of the session)<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the Game<br/>\n- Players put a check next to any ability on which Hero Points are spent<br/>\n- Players put a \u201c+\u201d beside those abilities used successfully<br/>\n- Players put a \u201c-\u201c beside those abilities used unsuccessfully<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer Scenes (16)<br/>\n- 8 Solo scenes (1 per player)<br/>\nLike Color Scenes from Burning Empires \u2013 we get a slice of the player\u2019s current activities and mindset, unlike BE players get one roll, most likely some kind of augment to a future use of an ability.)<br/>\n- 8 Group scenes (1 per player) <br/>\nEach player has a chance to engage with one NPC with whom they have a specified relationship.  Narrator may allow other PCs to be present with the understanding that other NPCs can thereby be present as well.  Such scenes could be resolved with any of the simple conflict mechanisms in the rules-set.<br/>\n\t- 5 NPC scenes<br/>\n\t- 3 specific kinds of scene<br/>\n\t(players may only have 1 of each)<br/>\n\ta) Clan Scene: a scene where a player tries to engage the clan leadership<br/>\n\tb) Team Scene: a scene where a player may set some inter-character planning.  I have grown tired of repeated \u201cso what are we going to do\u201d in-character discussions.<br/>\n\tc) Rune Scene: a scene where one of the 3 runes which ties the player to the magico-religious-cultural premises of the setting is at issue.<br/>\n- The \u201chero\u201d card: the player who grabs this may tie his or her individual successes to any of the clan\u2019s resources.  The downside is that his or her failures will hurt the clan as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM Side<br/>\n- 2 Schemer Scenes (1 for In Group figure of note, 1 for Out Group figure of note).  These are unlike the scenes in Burning Empires or the players\u2019 solo scenes in that the FoN\u2019s do not roll dice.  This is solely for fictional positioning.  A leader of the town watch fuming at a previous defeat by Jo-Jo the Sword Master has every right to confront Jo-Jo in a later scene backed up by his 25 constables.  I cannot have the watchman\u2019s fuming followed up by an entire Legion sweeping into the ghetto where the clan dwells.<br/>\n- 2 Intrigue Scenes (1 for the In Group figure of note, 1 for the Out Group figure of note).  The Narrator frames the FoNs conspiring with each other, or with further different groups to gain further fictional positioning.  PCs may ask or be asked to be present.<br/>\n- Extended Conflict: the GM calls for the session\u2019s Extended Conflict when the full extent of the PCs fictional positioning has become clear.  He may bring it about before he has completed all of his 4 other scenes.  He may ask to bring it before the PCs have completed all of theirs, but may not do so without consent.  Results of this Extended Conflict help (or harm) the clan\u2019s resource.<br/>\n- <br/>\n<br/>\nClosing Montage<br/>\n- Crisis review: how was the crisis met in or through any of the conflicts or player scenes?  GM and players contribute to a montage revealing the fictional effects of the scenes.  This fiction should be taken into account in the next session.<br/>\n- Also, address the consequences associated with the \u201chero\u201d card.<br/>\n<br/>\nPost Game.<br/>\n- Give 3 Hero Points<br/>\n- For any players whose chosen Lore Sheets were not addressed in the session, give a further Hero Point to the owning players<br/>\n- Total up checks, \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201c marks.  The ability which earned the most of each type is advanced by 1.  (These stack with each other and with bonuses for being a Rune or Ability of interest)<br/>\n- Players may chose to advance an Ability by 1 for every Hero Point they choose to spend, or a Keyword by 1 for every 2 Hero Points they spend<br/>\n- players may purchase 1 new lore sheet each at a cost of 1 HP<br/>\n- players decide which Lore Sheets will be active next session, including any just purchased<br/>\n- advance the default difficulty by 1 (this is a faster increase than the rulebook suggests)<br/>\n- hand shakes all around<br/>\n<br/>\nAll resistances will be set using the pass-fail mechanic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387274/#Comment_387274" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-16T09:34:43+00:00" title="August 16, 2012  9:34AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Updated procedures are here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xysQIVau5FszHqDyZ39CC6trk4SDbvdoWnwzAyLx-lc/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xysQIVau5FszHqDyZ39CC6trk4SDbvdoWnwzAyLx-lc/edit</a><br/><br/>Log of our sessions is here: <a href="http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaign/glor_hq_tag/adventure-log" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaign/glor_hq_tag/adventure-log</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
