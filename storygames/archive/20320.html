This chapter discusses the pros and cons of having fixed or variable systems during the game and how and when switch them during the game.<br/><br/>&gt; How does your system work at the game table? Any handout sheets? Example gameplay round?<br/><br/>It's 8 years that I'm working on and let players playing with the framework so there are many examples with different games and different systems derived from the framewor. They're in italian. I've published some free  games in english (for very young kids) and "Pride and Prejudice" for two players. I'm currently working on "Flashback Bullets" for three players.<br/>Anyway the framework gives the most when you cath the basic underlying concepts that allow you to 'change' the system on the fly at the table in order to adapt it to the group and to the fictional context being played at the moment.<br/><br/>&gt; As presentation format, I'd prefer a format closer to a book format. This looks more like Powerpoint/Web site.<br/><br/>You're right. Infact that's a concept draft material that I write and send to italian friends that take time to review it.<br/>Once the draft is completed (and consistent) for all chapters I'll write the final version.<br/><br/>&gt; Looking forward to seeing more!<br/><br/>Sure. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Thank you.<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br/><a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a><br/><br/>&gt; I would suggest using two different colors for "Shared Aesthetic Criteria" and "Personal Aesthetic Criteria".<br/><br/>I'll have a look. In any case in the final version of the manual all drawings will be re-done.<br/><br/>&gt; Pages 27 and 39 haven't been translated.<br/><br/>You're right. I'm going to amend it asap.<br/><br/>&gt; PAGE 37<br/>&gt; I didn't understand A \xabdystonia\xbb of imagination /.../ makes the validation process difficult" because Google defined &gt; dystonia as "a state of abnormal muscle tone resulting in muscular spasm and abnormal posture"<br/><br/>Well, I maybe used a wrong term, I'll be more precise in the final sketch of material.<br/>What I wanted to say is that the "Personal Imaginary Space" (i.e. how a single player is imagining the fiction) and the Shared Imaginary Space (i.e. an impossible 'space' representing the common features between all the players as if they were imagining exactly the same things in the same way)  are never aligned. This is good, because leaves space to interpretation and expectation about how the fiction can be modified. But if this two spaces are too much far (dystonia as opposed to syntony, maybe the right term would be unsync) no validation can occur because players are imagining the fiction too much differently between them, so some sort of sync is needed (no, the warrior was not near the door, no the snake had only three teeth, and so on).<br/><br/>&gt; I also only half understood "What happens is a syntactic and semantic evaluation of the statement and then a &gt; transposition in the imaginary spaces". I kinda understand semantic evaluation but not syntactic. I hoped that it would &gt; be explained on the following pages, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>AsIf is right.<br/>Also (maybe this comes from my time spent on computer based interactive fiction) it is very important what you say in terms of syntax of the statement in order to avoid ambiguity. Some consequences for this will be clear in the chapter 2.<br/>Rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447975/#Comment_447975" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-14T16:03:55+00:00" title="August 14, 2015  4:03PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great.

A decision assumes, to me, an opposition. Otherwise you wouldn't have anything to choose between.</blockquote>\nThe Power of Narration is a 'precise' thing. It implies that someone has the right to <b>propose</b> statements on fictional elements. It also implies that "that someone" has <b>ownership</b> of those fictional elements. Power of Narration infact requires a "narration scope". All these aulic words serve the purpose to identify exactly that if you have the ownership of  let's say "X" (And X is something in the fiction), you're not allowed to propose statements about Y. If you do, you are subject to Opposition by the other player who <b>owns</b> Y (and there should be always someone who controls Y).<br/>Someone at the table must have this power. It may be distributed or be concentrated in one player, or other stuff like that (I'll be more precise later) but at least one player must have it (also implicitly), otherwise no statements about the fiction can be created.<br/><br/>The Power of Opposition is another 'precise' thing. It comes in form of three elements:<br/>A. Constraints (these are fictional constraints/aspects/statements that cannot be touched or modified). Constraints are of a lot of different types. I'll get back later on this because it's not so simple to identify them.<br/>B. Vetos, basically 2 kind of. Aesthetic Vetos and Coherence Vetos.<br/>C. Conflicts. <b>Conflicts are raised whenever two players that owns different things in the fictional world do not agree about the proposed statement.</b><br/>Someone at the table must have this power. It may be distributed or be concentrated in one player, or other stuff like that (I'll be more precise later) but at least one player must have it (also implicitly), otherwise no statements about the fiction can be opposed.<br/><br/>The Power of Decision is another 'precise' thing. Basically answers to the question. "What do we do when someone narrates something and someone opposes? Who do we solve the 'stalemate'?" The framework identifies five types or resolution (the types of resolution say nothing with respect WHO exercises that power) and mixed solutions between them:<br/>1) Random (dice, cards)<br/>2) Authority<br/>3) Negotiation<br/>4) Voting<br/>5) Resource Based<br/><br/>In order to keep things "clean" you should think about the powers separated from the players. <b>However you're right that if you turn "Opposition" on, you've to turn on "Decision" also.</b><br/>In the simplest case, a single configuration or instance of the framework simply assigns the Powers to the Players and ask them to use the powers. You may have a 'bad system' and change it on the fly. Or, alternatively, you may design a more sofisticated game system and keep it fixed for the entire duration of the game.<br/>About Freytag's curve, I think I'm still far from that. It will be treated in chapter 6, when I'll talk about "cultural mix" between "interactive narration games" and "static dramatic storytelling".<br/><br/>If I succeed I'm going to describe in one of the next posts how the framework 'sees' for instance "The Pool" or "D&amp;D", two games, that I assume are known by everyone here (and I hope for a 'charitable reading' mode to be switched on).

I'm sure that answering your questions I'll clarify most of the doubts I have (Chapter 3, for instance, is a bit halted because I'm moving in 'uncharted' world. Each new slide is like a 'step in the dark' <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>Most games have different framework configuration throughout the game. <br/>Back to 'games example'.<br/><b>Note: I've edited the post to keep all considerations about "The Pool" in one single post.</b><br/>"The Pool", at the very beginning, has different 'configurations" occurring.<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n<blockquote>Chapter One: CHARACTER CREATION<br/><i>FROM THE MANUAL - <b>Once your group has decided on a setting</b> you can begin creating characters.</i></blockquote>\nThe bolded statement does not mean "everyone can says what he/she wants" but implies the following configuration.<br/><br/><b>Power of Narration</b>: Each player owns the whole fiction and can propose what he/she wants (saying vague statements like "Yes, zombie must be present", or says explicit statements on specific fictional elements like "There must be a white tree at the centre of the world").<br/><b>Power of Opposition</b>: Each player (given that owns the whole fiction) may oppose to each statement made by another player and may propose another option, or simply reject the proposal.<br/><b>Power of Decision</b>: Negotiation (Agreement is achieved through discussion until a "win-win" result is obtained).<br/><br/>After that, "The Pool" may start, and the game configuration changes (as you'll see in my next post). You may simply note that this framework configuration is potentially subject to "stalemate", because you may have players that disagree about the setting and all its related elements and rules-as-written say nothing about that, implying that people generally agrees if all players want to play and have fun.<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n<blockquote>Chapter One: CHARACTER CREATION (later on)<br/><i>FROM THE MANUAL - <b>Making a character is simple: just write a 50 word Story.</b> Pretend you\u2019re writing a book and this is the introduction of your main character.</i></blockquote>\n(Me thinking): So this means that it is something a player can do in "stand alone" with complete authority? Of course not.<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n<blockquote>Chapter Two: ASSIGNING TRAITS AND BONUSES<br/><i>FROM THE MANUAL - Though you can word a Trait any way you wish, <b>make sure it doesn\u2019t contradict or expand your Story.</b></i></blockquote>\n(Me thinking): Some more info... That's basically a check for Congruence or a check to verify if a Constraint has been violated.<br/><br/>What about the Powers in this case?<br/><b>Power of Narration</b>: Each player owns his/her character and has some control over some minor setting elements that can be slightly modified with additional info if accepted.<br/><b>Power of Opposition</b>: This is not clear because there's no explicit assignment about who can raise opposition if player makes something wrong. Looks like it's the player itself (or the group) that makes another check. Opposition in this case is done through "Constraint" check (no contradiction is allowed, also for pre-established setting) and "Congruence Veto".<br/><b>Power of Decision</b>: Negotiation (Agreement is achieved through discussion until a "win-win" result is obtained) or Authority, in case the single player amends directly the fiction for his character.<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n<blockquote>Chapter Three: CASTING THE DICE<br/><i>FROM THE MANUAL - <b>Dice are cast to determine the general outcome of conflicts.</b></i><br/><i>FROM THE MANUAL - <b>Anyone can call for a die roll whenever a conflict is apparent or when someone wants to introduce a new conflict.</b> Just broadly state your intention and roll.</i></blockquote>\n<b>Power of Narration</b>: Each player owns his/her character and has some control over some other fictional elements. In order to explain this I've to introduce the "equivalent statement" concept. Putting it simply, it's the statement that 'forces' the Opposition.\n<blockquote><i>Damart is in an ancient library. I want him to find a piece of knowledge that will help him on his quest, so I ask for a roll based on the Trait \u201csearching for the means to bring his love from the dead +1\u201d.</i></blockquote>\nTo me, this means that the following "equivalent" statement is trying to enter into the fiction: "Damart finds into the ancient library a piece of knowledge. This knowledge will help him on his quest."<br/><br/><b>Power of Opposition</b>: Looks like all the players can oppose, asking for Rolling.<br/><b>Power of Decision</b>: Who decides how to solve and how? Decision is "Resource Based" (the number of dice you have, and economy associated to them in terms of resource creation and consumption) and "Random (Dice Rolling)" mixed together. It's not important for the framework how sophisticated the type of resolution is. It's just one of five suggested or a mix between them with some sort of prioritization.<br/>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br/>And now we come to the great "The Pool" framework configuration in case of winning or losing the conflict<br/><br/>If you win:<br/><b>A) You prefer to get the die for the pool</b><br/><b>Power of Narration</b>: The GM has the right to take control of the fictional elements "in scope" for the conflict and narrates "not exactly what you intended".<br/><b>Power of Opposition</b>: No one can oppose.<br/><b>Power of Decision</b>: No one can oppose, so it is not needed.<br/>This configuration is 'weak', infact it's prone to discussion (there's a discussion on the forge forum regarding 'how far' a GM can go about narrating).<br/><b><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> You take the "Monologue of Victory"</b><br/><b>Power of Narration</b>: The player 'expands' his/her narration scope including his character and other elements "in scope" for the conflict (and even beyond).

"Keep your narration reasonably short".)<br/><b>Power of Decision</b>: What to do in case Opposition is raised? Decision is by Authority by GM ("If you ignore these rules, the GM may end your MOV at any time.")<br/><br/>If you lose the roll:<br/><b>Power of Narration</b>: The GM has the right to take control of the fictional elements "in scope" for the conflict and narrates "exactly not what you intended" ("The details of the outcome are entirely up to him.
