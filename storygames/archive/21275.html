It can be themes, type of conflicts, or type of relations.<br/><br/>I had one group that loved to play to shock the others. In order to get maximum effect with minimal effort, we through in rapes. It didn't matter what kind of rule lite game we played, sooner a later the rape got in there.

I'm mainly interested in the impact in the fiction.</p></div></blockquote>\nTwo points about this whole question:<br/><b>*</b> You're implicitly assuming a speculative counter-factual: to "measure impact" we would need to somehow have access to control data, but that doesn't make any sense when considering a single instance of play. If the group was playing without this rule, or with a different rule, then it would be a different instance of play, so we don't really have anything to compare a given case against - not unless we consider statistical impact over a larger set of actual play instances.<br/><b>*</b> You're implicitly assuming that "a rule" exists in the course of actual play. I do not underwrite this claim myself insofar as precise technical analysis goes: what actually goes on in a normal rpg session is that the players are relying on a holistic systemic framework that offers them procedural structures to follow while playing. From this viewpoint one could say that all rules always have the same amount of impact in a real instance of play: the rule either is part of the system in play, or it isn't, and whatever system of play is being followed always has a complete and thorough "impact", no more and no less.<br/><br/>Due to the above two concerns I'm not at all convinced that your question is answerable in this form. I'll emphasize that this is not a round-about way of saying that it's a stupid question; it's very common in philosophical pursuits to formulate questions that seem superficially valid, but that prove inherently meaningless under further analysis.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that there is no meaningful way to speak of the impact of individual rules, but I would be inclined to do that via system analysis that compares two systems (one with the rule, and another one otherwise identical, except lacking that rule). We do this in game design all the time, but the concerns are not quite as simple as "how much impact does the rule have"; rather, the real question is "what alternative system will the players choose instead, if we remove this rule?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466180/#Comment_466180" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-10T00:30:53+00:00" title="September 10, 2017 12:30AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Upstart" rel="nofollow">Upstart</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Is there a way you could measure the impact of a rule/mechanic, even for a single session?

Test a bunch of times and note patterns, or play once with people you know well and see how they play differently.<br/><br/>Compare lethal and forgiving combat rules.  The former produces either fiction about planning and sneaking and cleverly avoiding fights, or a long trail of corpses of protagonists you never really get to know.  The latter produces heroic fantasy.  You can see this across dozens of sessions, or in the one moment when the player decides to charge into battle or not.<br/><br/>Look at all the special playbook moves in a PbtA game.  Picking those predicts chunks of the fiction's direction.  An AW game with a Hocus using Hocus moves is gonna create fiction with an element of leading followers; an AW game with a Brainer using Brainer moves instead will add a very different element to the fiction.  Part of it is just the selection of fictional elements, but another part is the rules that make those elements effective.  Using your Hocus and Brainer moves <i>gets</i> you stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466242/#Comment_466242" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-13T20:33:56+00:00" title="September 13, 2017  8:33PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 13, 2017 8:34PM by Upstart.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the fundamental draw of PbtA is actually the relatively direct fictional impact of the rules. <br/><br/>I agree with Eero about the inherent statistical problem.

I've done tons of text mining of RPGs but I've never thought about that. Or even thought about how to approach that. So maybe? <br/><br/>Like the number and complexity of rules to engage with a unit of fiction?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466327/#Comment_466327" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-18T21:40:14+00:00" title="September 18, 2017  9:40PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like that, at least as a tool for special cases or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
