You could get even further away from the movie, which still pays a lot of attention to what happened, and not even let the players add new events (or key events) during the game, and instead they have to negotiate their experiences of those events.

Even if some of these are provided by the designer, you can design rules for how to fill out the details, how to make it <i>ours</i>.<br/><br/>You can design rules for what narrative control each player has. Can I say that it's raining? Can I say there's a knife on the table? Can I say what your character is feeling? Can I say what your character is feeling if we have sex? Who gets to set the next scene? Can I declare what happened 10 years ago if I sacrifice something now? Can dip into resolution, but I think it can be used for much more. More about creating in an orderly way than resolving.<br/><br/>Then there's that fancy new blackbox concept, where playing is done on a stage and props like music, stage light, and masks are used to direct mood, which layer of fiction you're playing in, what character you currently are and more. I've yet to play any of it, unfortunately.<br/><br/>I feel there should be more to this, but I'm coming up short for now.

Here it is:<br/><br/>1) Coloring action attempts and outcomes.  The GM determines what happens, but the mechanics determine what it looks like.  <br/><br/>2) Resolving fictional positioning (possibly including effectiveness/resource), which feeds into subsequent situation.  The GM says you win the fight, but the dice say you lost your sword, your eye, and the deed to your land.  Now the next scenes aren't going to be about sniping and hacking and bossing around; they might be about going back for another deed and squabbling with nobles while your enemies gather strength, or about learning how to wrestle.<br/><br/>3) Adding context.  Adding flashbacks, cutaways, or other fictional content that adds context to the characters' actions and the GM's outcome.<br/><br/>4) Manipulating the medium.  Are the facts of the fiction described as if in a movie, or as if read from an ancient scroll?  Do we speak loudly or quietly, all at once or in turns?  Do we invoke key phrases or other rituals?<br/><br/>5) Developing character.  Beyond what the actions and cutaways show us, is there anything else the audience ought to see or know now about your guy?<br/><br/>6)  Resolving relationships between participants and fictional elements.  Who controls which character, etc.  (Heck, this could even include the recruiting of a 2nd GM, or a conspirator who knows a certain portion of the Story Before!  Or a player getting to introduce a subplot!  Or the GM upgrading NPCs to player-character status in the eyes of the mechanics!)<br/><br/>7) Refining the possibility space for "what could happen" going forward, potentially including changes to the system for producing "what does happen".  This could create new modes of play, or simply alternate between pre-designed ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399117/#Comment_399117" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T08:01:28+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  8:01AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What moral lesson should we the audience and/or the characters learn from these events?<br/><br/>How can we reuse the same tropes in the most amusing fashion?  Cf. Phineas and Ferb, where the events of the episode are nearly identical nearly every episode, but the show remains consistently entertaining.  (Many other kids shows also do the same, though usually in a less explicit and self-aware manner.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
