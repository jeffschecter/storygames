The principle is "You have complete authority over what your character thinks, but sometimes you have to cede authority over what your character does." Specifically, I can make you do something, but I can't make you like it. What that means for the credibility of a threat is that you are the only authority we have on whether your character believes mine will follow through. We trust each other to use that authority according to the principle "We each play our characters as if they were real people".</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nFree form is the gift to <b>form great games</b> released from the real.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is interpenetration and your choice<br/>\nReactionship Interpretation (system)<br/>\nRelationship your choice (towards the systems outcome)<br/>\n<br/>\nChanged bits here to try and make more sense!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322247/#Comment_322247" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T10:17:15+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 10:17AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The post title 'what freeform means' and the post - which sounds like we're defining the differences between mechanics and procedures - don't jibe for me. Paul seems to be answering the title. <br><br>I'd like an answer to the other thing. I've also been using the word 'techniques' lately. I think I know them when I see them but I'm not sure how to define them.<br><br>"Say 'try a different way'" "Write down an issue." "Everyone gets four scenes." "Move the characters tokens to the stage they're on for the scene" "Decide what hollywood actor would play your character" "Choose whether you escape into the night, recant, or burn at the stake" - procedures<br><br>"Don't narrate another player's character's thoughts." "Make Apocalypse World seem real" "Try to make good things happen for your character." "draw a veil if the subject matter is uncomfortable for you"  - techniques<br><br>"Roll 2d6+hard, on a 10+ do 2 harm." "After your fifth experience point, mark improvement." "When you fall below 0 hit points, you're unconscious." "If you lose the roll, get back your pool dice +1" "When you act on your key, gain xp." - mechanics<br><br>But then there's gray areas. What's Archipelago's "Draw a Resolution card and interpret the results" - is that a procedure, mechanic, technique - or a mix?<br><br>One difference is purpose: a mechanic is usually there to softly incent player behavior. ("I better not roll, because I'll probably lose," or "I better roll, because I'll get xp" or "I better act roguish, so I can draw a card." or "I better play to my weaknesses so I can go on the owe list.") Mechanics might take a while to kick in, because the players won't realize until after multiple playing the value of the incentives. And a player might always choose to ignore the mechanic.<br><br>A technique or procedure, otoh, usually demands a certain player behavior. It's the rule. You have to do this. If you don't "Make Apocalypse World seem real", then you're not playing Apocalypse World.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322249/#Comment_322249" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-29T10:28:50+00:00" title="April 29, 2011 10:28AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the lack of context!

(Dave Berg may disagree with me on this one here!  I'll certainly stipulate that this particular criterion is heavily limited by genre.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
