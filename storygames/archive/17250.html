My experiences w/ players w/ secrets has largely just been extremely time-consuming and dull, and I've drawn the incorrect conclusion "secrets are lame and should never be used" rather than "secrets are difficult to use and I've simply never seen it."  \n<blockquote>That's really interesting.

I've never seen it end in anything but not playing w/ them further, and only stems from a competitive outlook, in my experience.<br/><br/>Also, I like your definition of playing honestly and transparently better than mine!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
