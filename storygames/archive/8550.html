I've played a lot of one-shots, but have never gotten to ride Capes through several sessions of play. I pitched some ideas - super-powered martial artists, time travel, generic superhoes. They seemed meh about all of them and then Chris pitched early-industrial superheroes. We'd all just read <i>The Devil in the White City</i> f or a book club we're all in so we had that as a reference point. However none of us are experts on early industrial America so this game will be light on historical accuracy.<br/><br/>We only did three scenes:<br/><br/>Scene 1 - Alan Aldritch (shit, that's a soundalike with Alan Aldridge, I hate when I do that) the slaughterhouse heir and possessor of all sorts of strange gizmodgery discovers a strange corpse in one of his slaughteryards. The pigs have mostly eaten it, but it's clear that it's not human. He has one of his workman fetch a police officer who comes to investigate. The police end up dragging away Clinton, one of the slaughterman, as a suspect. Aldritch promises to clear his name.<br/><br/>The first scene ran really, really long on free roleplay which I find is something that happens a lot with new players to the game. Chris was first player because I was just totally stumped on a way to set things up. A murder is always a good way to get things rolling. But he was really reluctant to bring a conflict. When he finally did, after some kibitzing, it was Event: Someone gets arrested for activities most unsavory. I won that Conflict and Clinton went downtown.<br/><br/>Scene 2 took place at the coroner's office. There were no superheroes in this scene. Just a coroner, his apprentice, and the body. The coroner ended up recognizing the creature as an experiment with aqueous humors, the primary field of research of Dr. Crumb. We also had a conflict where the coroner's assistant wanted to prove himself to be ready to be a coroner, after which the coroner let the assistant take the lead on further autopsy of the creature.<br/><br/>We ended up with both conflicts in this scene being Deadlocked which I'd never seen before, but nobody had either Story Tokens or superpowered characters who could bring debt into a conflict, so the two conflicts ended up with 6'es on both sides and we had to collaboratively narrate. <br/><br/>Third and final scene, Clinton is being questioned downtown when a huge horror of a man known as The Vulgar showed up at the police station. He claims that the body is a family member and would like to see it. The police chief cuffs him and throws him in a cell. While he's being taken down to the cell, he says that he needs the body to survive. Meanwhile, Clinton manages to pop a cop in the groin and make his escape.<br/><br/>Chris was disappointed in this scene. He still hadn't totally grasped the rules, and laid down a really good conflict about the Vulgar killing everyone in the police station, but he didn't get when Conflicts resolved so didn't strategize appropriately and lost both of them.<br/><br/>The game was a little slow but I think that's because we just jumped in and the premise didn't totally hum for all of us. Between now and next week I'm going to try and do some research, and also come into the game with some characters and storylines in mind. So if anyone has any tips on websites I could check out for some good ideas about early industrial Chicago let me know.<br/><br/>Oh, and I could swear when I've played with Tony at conventions during the first page after a Conflict is laid down nobody Claims a side, but I couldn't back this up with the text.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189545/#Comment_189545" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:00:59+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:00AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Oh, and I could swear when I've played with Tony at conventions during the first page after a Conflict is laid down nobody Claims a side, but I couldn't back this up with the text.</blockquote>Well, Claiming happens at the beginning of a page, before anyone's turn.  Creating a conflict (unless it's done with a Story Token) happens during someone's turn, after the beginning of the page ... so by then it's too late.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189553/#Comment_189553" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:20:03+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:20AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, I thought when the First Player lays down the first Conflict ending free play, then the first page starts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189560/#Comment_189560" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:35:13+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The page starts and claims occur before free play.
