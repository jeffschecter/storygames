It seems easy to say that it would be, but I wonder...<br/><br/>What about an RPG played with a young child, where the child deals with every encounter by bashing the NPC in the face with a hammer? A gentle "Your character is a friendly gnome and he probably wouldn't hit everyone he meets" would seem easier than having to run around the issue in-game, especially if one also wishes to teach manners to the child in question.<br/><br/>What about an RPG played with a novice who has never played a Wizard before? If the player hefts a sword and charges into battle like Gandalf, does the GM let them get cut down because of their mistaken assumption, or does he gently remind them that Wizards in this game have no more than 4 hit points, and can't wield swords well?<br/><br/>What about an RPG wherein elves are incapable of crying because they have no tear ducts, and a player says his elf cries? Does the GM remind the player of the biological impossibility, or does the GM rewrite his game world and retcon something because a player made something up?<br/><br/>What about the example given in the article, where "the consequences of the player\u2019s action result... in the death of the entire party"? Is it acceptable to simply let one player pull the lever that destroys the world, ruining the evening for the other six players? Or is it better to tell one person "no" and let the others continue?<br/><br/>I am all for "Yes, and...", but I really do wonder if "No" is preferable more often than might be thought.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221884/#Comment_221884" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-31T23:05:08+00:00" title="July 31, 2009 11:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a marked difference between "Your character woudn't do that" and "Are you sure that's what you want to do?".

It happens pretty regularly with stuff like NPC names, etc.  <br/><br/>This permissive attitude is, I think, predicated on an expectation that players are all engaged and aware, and aren't going to introduce a magic wand into my gritty police procedural.  So the dissonance that crops up is minor and not worth worrying about.  <br/><br/>One counter example - in our TSOY game, one guy has a character with a hidden past.  It's transparent to us as players, but our character's don't know his "real" name.  When I used it once in character, we stopped and retconned the scene a bit, because the big reveal is going to be a fun and important part of the campaign.

Besides, if blocking one player is bad, then surely blocking all the other players via TPK is worse?  If it's a mistake that kills the game (ignoring why that shouldn't be the case), then the GM has at least as much at stake as the player.  If it were so much more fun to kill off the party, then the GM wouldn't even have considered blocking the player in the first place.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Of course, one thing the article didn't clarify was whether the statement was a challenge or GM fiat.  The author seemed to assume it was the latter just because it was bluntly worded.  But maybe he only needed to justify why his character <i>would</i> act in such a manner.  "I'm making a once in a lifetime mistake because my mind's on X.  Happens to everyone."  And maybe the GM was only defending his own right to make such challenges as a fellow player.<br/><br/>Suppose the player's solution to the security problem was, "I'm exploding like an atom bomb and taking out the entire world with me."  As a challenge, "Your character wouldn't do that" seems perfectly acceptable to me in most games.  "You fail" is also acceptable, for obvious reasons; but in the beginning, couldn't and wouldn't are identical.  If the player tried to use his hacking skills, as the article suggests, the GM might rule that the character failed so quickly that, in matter of fact, they failed to even conceive of way of applying their hacking skills to the situation.  Ultimately, "Your character wouldn't do that" is just another way of saying, "You fail too quickly for meaningful consequence to stem from your actions."<br/><br/>So if the player were being rational, then he'd admit his real problem was that he wanted a meaningful hacking scenario right then and the GM wouldn't supply one.  "You <i>would</i> give me a meaningful hacking scenario now."  He's making the same kind of challenge against the GM as the GM made against the player.  It boils down to negotiation; and while the GM did a poor job of it, at least he brought justifications to the table, while the player just made demands (or so the article makes it seem).  That said, I can't fault the player for leaving the table if there are others more agreeable.  I'm just not sure he should be categorically blaming the GM for saying, "Your character would not do that."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221938/#Comment_221938" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T11:20:06+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 11:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Burr</cite>So if the player were being rational, then he'd admit his real problem was that he wanted a meaningful hacking scenario right then and the GM wouldn't supply one.  "You<i>would</i>give me a meaningful hacking scenario now."</blockquote>\nNot to sidetrack my own point for a moment, but I have to say that in particular is one of my gripes about some games (or at least the way they can sometimes be run). I take issue with the belief that every player must have something equally meaningful to contribute to each and every encounter, which to hear the creators talk about 4e was a central design decision there: to give the fighters as much to do as the wizards, and to give everyone something cool and awesome to do at every moment, both in and out of combat. IMHO that's a bad lesson to teach. Just because players want their characters to be important to every situation does not mean that they are, or should be. It sounds like it might be a way to help push role-playing and narrative, but in practice it's never worked out that way for me. <br/><br/>"What do you do?" turns into "You should do something" when in fact sometimes it's OK for the rogue to hide in shadows and lay low for a few minutes, or for the hacker to simply duck and cover while the bullets start flying. Otherwise, it simply becomes "Oh look at that crazy dwarf, always Intimidating everyone we meet" or "Oh, I guess because I'm a hacker then I'll try to hack every computer/door/robot/traffic camera/calculator I come across" or "Look at that crazy Mesmero, always mesmerizing the first person we meet in every encounter" because that's the one thing that character happens to be good at. Just because you have a hammer does not mean the world is full of nothing but nails, and sometimes the guy with the screwdriver should get a chance before you bash the screw in. A GM who magically inserts computer locks outside every single door in the entire world just to give the hacker something to always do is just doling out antibiotics to someone with a cold. It's not helping, and it's probably hurting in the long run.<br/><br/>And to loop this back to the original issue, I think this sort of gameplay sort of contributes to issues where "Your character would not do that" is a tempting thing to say, if ill-advised. Because the issue is often not that your character would not do something, but that sometimes your character would not do anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222001/#Comment_222001" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T20:37:50+00:00" title="August  1, 2009  8:37PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2009 2:27PM by johnzo.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>Just because you have a hammer does not mean the world is full of nothing but nails.</blockquote>\nIf I GMed for a party of hammers, I would make them a world of nails.

What happens in shared spaces -- the table, the wiki, the email -- is much more important.  If you've got an established-at-table canon that says that elves don't cry, then yeah, maybe it's time for a reminder.  But if the player is playing the elf PC and they say they can cry, then elves can cry and to hell with it.  ( edit: and if the elf player says that elves can cry tears of smoke or ice depending on whether they are pitying themselves or others -- then HELL YEAH! )\n<blockquote>Is it acceptable to simply let one player pull the lever that destroys the world, ruining the evening for the other six players?

My most memorable IAWA game ever ended with the freezing of the world into an iceball by Grandfather Winter.  That was cool and everyone was good with it.<br/><br/>Similarly, any act of funwrecking ought to be called out at the table and dealt with.  If some people at the table say, 'hey, you're wrecking my fun!' and the lever-puller is unsympathetic to that, then you've got an incompatibility that probably can't be wallpapered over with any amount of GM fiat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222019/#Comment_222019" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T06:47:52+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  6:47AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude.

That's why I'm going to ask <i>why</i> instead of just saying no. Sure, I might still say no afterwards, but I want to hear their reasoning first.<br><br>There's a big difference between:<br><br><i>GM: Elves don't have tear ducts, remember? Why do you want your elf to cry?<br/>PLAYER: Because that tear duct thing is lame, man. It's my character and I'll cry if I wanna!</i><br/><br/>and:<br/><br/><i>GM: Elves don't have tear ducts, remember? Why do you want your elf to cry?<br/>PLAYER: Because the elven goddess of Sorrow has returned from exile, signaling the end of the elves' Age of Innocence.</i><br/><br/>If the player <i>negates</i> my creative input, that's not cool.

I just try not to use boring nails.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>What about an RPG wherein elves are incapable of crying because they have no tear ducts, and a player says his elf cries? Does the GM remind the player of the biological impossibility, or does the GM rewrite his game world and retcon something because a player made something up?</blockquote>\nI don't think what's in the GM's head is sacred. What happens in shared spaces -- the table, the wiki, the email -- is much more important. If you've got an established-at-table canon that says that elves don't cry, then yeah, maybe it's time for a reminder. But if the player is playing the elf PC and they say they can cry, then elves can cry and to hell with it. ( edit: and if the elf player says that elves can cry tears of smoke or ice depending on whether they are pitying themselves or others -- then HELL YEAH! )\n<blockquote>Is it acceptable to simply let one player pull the lever that destroys the world, ruining the evening for the other six players? Or is it better to tell one person "no" and let the others continue?</blockquote>\nMy golden rule is that anything that increases the fun is okay. My most memorable IAWA game ever ended with the freezing of the world into an iceball by Grandfather Winter. That was cool and everyone was good with it.<br/><br/>Similarly, any act of funwrecking ought to be called out at the table and dealt with. If some people at the table say, 'hey, you're wrecking my fun!' and the lever-puller is unsympathetic to that, then you've got an incompatibility that probably can't be wallpapered over with any amount of GM fiat.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure this could be the backbone of a How To GM Master Class.<br/><br/>When characters say "I am a hammer," they are intrinsically requesting to the GM that their play center boldly on nail-bashing. If I choose Favored Enemy: Vampire, I'm actively suggesting for vampires to appear in the game, so much so that I'm mechanically banking on their appearance for my character to be at peak effectiveness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222223/#Comment_222223" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T11:16:16+00:00" title="August  3, 2009 11:16AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Leonard Balsera</cite><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>It sounds like it might be a way to help push role-playing and narrative, but in practice it's never worked out that way for me.</blockquote>\nThis is a non-sequitor, so please treat it like one.<br/><br/>I thought the "everybody has something meaningful to do during encounters" thing was a 4E design goal because staring at a battlemap for an hour or two while your friends do cool shit utterly sucks.

Negating other people's stuff is bad, whether it's the GM or player or whomever.<br/><br/>My main point is more one of technique than of fiction authority.  If the GM has a beautiful cathedral in his head, or coming in from some 300-page sourcebook--  then in my experience it isn't practical to expect the players to know every cranny of that cathedral preplay.  And I hate during-play canon correction; to me, that's like hearing a stylus drag across a record. <br/><br/>I know I've been terribly frustrated at times, trying to add contributions to a largely mysterious and invisible canon.  Whenever I see con ads for games that are episodes in some GM's private world that has a real-time history of decades of play, I run away.<br/><br/>So, at our table, I try to proceed under the idea that if some setting detail hasn't come up in the game ever before, it's a blank slate and anyone can kick into it so long as the consensus is positive about it.  And if anyone has an element like 'elf' or 'mercenary' or 'mountain fighter' in their backstory, they have fictional authority there -- I try to always ask players' permission before riffing on their backstories, so that their view of it and mine do not evolve in contrary ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222280/#Comment_222280" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T13:55:32+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  1:55PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>Skill challenges</blockquote>\nHave you sat on the sidelines and watched your friends do a Complexity 4 or 5 skill challenge yet, the ones that are meant to replace a normal encounter?<br/><br/>If so, how'd that go?

Was it fun?<br/><br/>I've been in three 4th Edition groups now. I have two friends who are in 4th Edition groups and report the same behavior. In every case, the skill challenges all go like this, pretty much verbatim.<br/><br/>"OK you guys have to negotiate with the orc king or he will attack you. You need 5 successes before 3 failures. What do you do? Ed you go first."<br/><br/>"Well Intimidate is my best skill so I'll try that." (rolls)<br/><br/>"Ok that's one success. The orc king is impressed by your bravery. Who's next? Fred?"<br/><br/>"OK I'll try Diplomacy since that's my best skill." (rolls)<br/><br/>"Ooh, sorry, that's a failure. Diplomacy is not on my list of approved skills for this challenge. The orc king gets mad at you. Ted?"<br/><br/>"Hmmm. Well I guess I'll try Knowledge: Local History." (rolls)<br/><br/>"Ok that's two successes. The orc king is impressed that you know about his people's history in this land. Ed, what about you?"<br/><br/>"Is it my turn again? OK, well I'll try to Intimidate again because that's my best skill." (rolls)<br/><br/>"OK three successes. The orc king is even more intimidated now.

It's occurred in 5 separate instances with 5 different groups and both experienced and inexperienced GMs. Something about the way skill challenges are described eats away at the very soul of role-playing and seems to turn what used to be role-played scenarios into a half hour of die rolling.<br/><br/>I understand that many many many people have had different experiences but I have not been impressed. At all.<br/><br/>I am enjoying my 1st and 3rd edition groups immensely, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222333/#Comment_222333" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T21:57:26+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  9:57PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2009 9:57PM by kevperrine.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><br/>So, at our table, I try to proceed under the idea that if some setting detail hasn't come up in the game ever before, it's a blank slate and anyone can kick into it so long as the consensus is positive about it.  <br/><br/>-- I try to always ask players' permission before riffing on their backstories, so that their view of it and mine do not evolve in contrary ways.</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>So I completely agree and do the same myself.

I've not played games for as long as some (didn't start until after college)  so I've heard loads of stories about DMs that were hardcore (or hard-ass might be a better term) that stood mysteriously behind the screen and set their setting in stone with NO player creative input...  no *asking* anyone for ANYTHING.  <br/>And strangely (from my point of view)  those times are generally fondly remembered.

(I ask for thoughts, then after hearing all sides make my final decision with the input)<br/><br/>So then .... I wonder sometimes - SHOULD I take a tighter grip?

It's what Sim is all about (he said, and then ducked, not sure if poo would be flung). <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Tony is right in that everyone at the table has equal rights. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is hard to wrap your head around, but... sometimes saying, "Huh? What? You sure?" is not unfun trammeling. Some players like to be reigned in, and learn what the limitations are on the creativity. As I'm fond of saying, if you cut infinite space in half, you still have an infinite amount of space on either side. Constraints on play do not have to be limiting, they can be empowering. And so having you tell me that I've fucked up a constraint can be, to me, positive feedback. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, saying "Your character would not do that" is simply wrong from a ritual POV. Ron H has it right above. Don't shut the player down, show him the constraint, and then allow the player to wander back into it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMe: "Elves crying? I think that we set up a FACT earlier on in the game that elves do not cry. How about they do something else instead?"<br/>\nYou: "Oh, yeah, that's right. Uh, cool... how about they keen?"<br/>\nMe: "That is the Awesome... I'll even pay the coin for that fact."<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so I'm not always playing Universalis. More commonly I'll say something like, "Er... the way I had it written up, Elves do not cry. I thought that was pretty cool - gives them a very non-human side. Do you really need for them to be crying? Or could we maybe go with something else here?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's simple. Have constraints, make them negotiable, and then try to use them as a springboard for new creativity, instead of either trampling constraints willy-nilly, or using them to shut folks down. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222346/#Comment_222346" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T01:54:49+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  1:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ::flings poo::<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not what Sim is all about. That's simply one way of addressing Sim play. I think it's been pretty well established that I have a strong tendency toward Sim, and that sort of draconian approach to setting authoring doesn't sit well with me, and never has.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, if it's been established, then it's canon, and can't be changed willy-nilly. If it's something a player is invested in, then it can be talked about to find something that works with the canon in a fun and interesting way. Consistency is the important thing with this sort of exploration of setting. I've played with GMs who've tried to shut down player contributions, and it's never worked well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side, I've also played with players who didn't like to have any sort of creative input beyond the actions of their characters. They've even been a little confused if the GM asks to screw with their backstory... That's what they created it for, isn't it? On the flipside, those same players can get pretty uppity if you start mucking around with what they've established as having occurred in their backstory.. What they haven't determined is open game, but damnit, if I say my character's parents were killed by undead, you'd best not go saying it was actually orcs. An orcish necromancer commanded the undead, sure. But it was undead, damnit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222361/#Comment_222361" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T06:39:28+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  6:39AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2009 6:46AM by jenskot.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>Instead of "your character would not do that", I prefer "<i>why</i>would your character do that?"<br><br>Asking "why" invites further contribution from the player, rather than negating the contribution they've already made.</br></br></blockquote>\nI agree with Ron.<br><br>I almost quit roleplaying after playing my first time because I was bombarded with, "your character would not do that."

The <i>authoritative</i> GM who says "This is *MY* world" will mean something like, "If you agree with me on things like this, it will provide a cohesive element to the story.  Let's not waste our passion on negotiating this further when we could just get on with a great scene."  (Though probably neither of those is the best way to put it in words.)

Why not ask the question, "When is it appropriate and even fun to say, 'Your character would not do that,'?"  It's not out of the question for a group to agree at the beginning, or come to agree in play, that we can trade off ownership for something really cool happening in the story.<br><br>Consider: In Fiasco, Alice is resolving a scene.  This means that the rest of us will be setting it up. Bob suggests that his character and Alice's character should meet for an honest drug transaction. I say, "Bob, I don't think that moves things forward. Instead, it's a controlled buy, so you go there backed up by the dirty cop who's running you as a snitch. Wear a wire. You're strung out, the cop's strung out, and so you don't conceal it well."  I just re-authored Bob's intention. The mechanics of Fiasco are such that if Bob and I disagree, Alice makes the call, so it's possible that Bob's guy takes an action specifically opposed to what Bob wanted to do.  (Of course, I'm not a jerk, and ideally I convince Bob with my pacing argument, or back off, rather than have Alice drag his character kicking and screaming into the scene.)<br/><br/>Hell, don't we already give up a little authorship in D&amp;D when we say that if our to-hit roll is less than the target number, we don't succeed in our intention to kill the goblin and take his stuff? If we're willing to cede control for something so mundane, shouldn't we be willing to do the same to help make our story awesome, and make our friends' characters awesome, from time to time?<br/><br/>Any rate... Why didn't the author ask the question about when it is OK to say something like "Your character would not do that"?  How invested is he in those assumptions? Or is it actually that he was irritated with the space GM's lack of tact and grace, and chose to couch is criticism in a sweeping generalization because he lacks the social skills to speak directly to space GM about his irritation at the way he handled a story-improving suggestion?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222474/#Comment_222474" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T13:26:21+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  1:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael, I'm going to start a new thread regarding the non-sequitor, so as not to continue taking up space here.

Far too many gamers (and people in general) have a near pathological aversion to uttering that statement. Usually because lots of jerks in their life have made it clear that their likes and dislikes don't matter. So it has to get cloaked in other things.<br/><br/>It's the same behavior as every hour-long argument at a D&amp;D table about how heavy the stone of the door lintel is, and can it really be limestone or would it be sandstone in this region and should it crack or shatter? All that BS is masking people who can't bring themselves to say, "Please don't kill my character for no goddamn reason. I like playing him." Instead of talking to each other, person to person, about what they want and value, everything is dressed up in "logic" and rhetoric designed to make the other person look stupid if they do the thing you don't like.<br/><br/>Some story gamers have gotten savvy. They don't say "Your character wouldn't do that." They say "It would make a better story if...." instead. But the unresolved trust and control issues are still there.<br/><br/>I want a permissive table, same as Morningstar. Usually it works out that way.

That is, I think there's a valid form of play where the separations of power over character and canon are key to it's enjoyment. <br/>\n<br/>\nJohn is correct that there are times when it's just dysfunctional interpersonal stuff going on. But not always. As somebody points out, some players just want to "be" the character, and not have to think much outside of that box (hell Jeepform immersion at times seems to me to be some sort of split-personality exercise where you have to be two people at once - one who "is" the character, and one who is the author... to say nothing of something like the E-word immersionists who would cough up a lung if forced to share their character). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn those cases, however, then Ron's technique is even more important. If you don't think something is plausible, ask the player why they think it is. You may be surprised, and they have a plausible reason for the act that you hadn't considered. Or they may simply have fucked up, and on answering your question will find that they want to revisit something. Either way, however, you have given the player even more authority than before to entertain with their character.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike: "Your character shot the third door because??? I mean there's a one third chance his friend is behind there. Yeah, you know that she's not behind door number three, but your character doesn't."<br/>\nJohn: "Oh, no, it's not like that... I hadn't even thought about which door she's behind. My character shot door three, because three is his lucky number, remember?"<br/>\nMike: "Oh, heh, yeah, that's right. Cool."<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you say, "your character wouldn't do that" you're just shutting down the player, and implying another act for the character. You're taking control. This is the number one bad thing to do in RPGs: don't ever take away a player's main vector for agency. Not even short term. Work with them, instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it might sound odd coming from one of the authors of Universalis, but, uh, if I'm playing a relatively traditional game with PCs, then you pretty damn well better keep your claws off my character. Yeah, sure, I've been burned by bad GMs... so it must be that I just have left-over control issues? No... I just want to have a relatively clearly defined area of control in the game. No, character monogamy is not a necessity. But sometimes it's how we slice up the cake, and it works fine, too. Just because I have final say over what my character does, does not mean that I am allowed to ruin the game for all with bad play. I could as easily claim that refusing character monogamy is a reaction to My Guy Syndrome. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand if somebody makes an argument that getting rid of character monogamy for a while in play can help people better understand how to work characters for the benefit of all. However that's just a good skill to take back to the relatively traditional power split. Character monogamy is no less evolved a way to play, and some people do it perfectly well without ever having to be shown any new skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll give an example from actual play. I was at a game at a convention where I had this character who had some serious character flaws. But was also in my mind very cool in certain specific ways. I tend to like this sort of character (who doesn't, eh?). Anyhow, we did this scene where my character was shot down by a woman who he was interested in. I had it happening in a certain way, but another player announced that it wasn't humiliating enough. They had thought up a much more ironic situation. I said that I didn't like the proposal, though I don't think I could say precisely why at the time. The other player implied to me that I was holding back with the character, not playing it to the hilt for the enjoyment of the group. I got a little huffy at this point, and stood up for my original version. Which really seemed to disappoint the other player. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other version may have been better for that player, heck maybe for all of the other players. At least for that moment. How can I know for sure? But I would have really started to dislike the character I was playing, had I gone the rout they suggested. I didn't want to play the buffoon character. That's not what I'd envisioned, and not what I'd invested myself working on to that point in the story. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow... maybe I just didn't communicate all of that well. There's a distinct chance that the characters I like are dull to other people, too. But the thing that really got me angry  about it wasn't so much that somebody had a different vision for my character in a scene. But that I was being told that I had to sacrifice all of my own enjoyment in the character for the sake of one improvement to one scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor every simmy GM saying "Your character wouldn't do that" there's a Jeepformer somewhere saying "It would be better for the story if your character did X instead of Y." Both can suck. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222624/#Comment_222624" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T01:10:05+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  1:10AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread, and more particularly Mike's last post, has made me think of specific circumstances where I have been guilty of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost striking in my mind is when roleplaying with my wife. There have been moments where she's gotten into character in such a way that everything was awesome. By and large though, she is a less confident roleplayer, and tends to create cool concepts, then play them as herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example: She created an assassin character who had betrayed her guild because she didn't want to do it anymore. The background was awesome. Her father was the guildmaster, so he was chief amongst those gunning for her. When I suggested that character choose theme songs, she chose Passive, by A Perfect Circle, which was an amazing choice (especially as she doesn't normally listen to that type of music). Sometimes in play, she'd play this to perfection, especially in the beginning. The first session of that game was among the best roleplaying I've ever seen from her.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo often however, she'd play the character as trusting, open, friendly and outgoing. It seemed diametrically opposed to the cool story she came up with. I never up and out said "Your character wouldn't do that" because, well, it's her character for one, and she tends to be sensitive about criticism in roleplaying. I'd make comments like "You definitely play her differently than I'd expect an assassin to be played." Or make joking cracks about the friendly assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't necessarily know what I intend to get out of this anecdote. Maybe to show that I'm an asshole. Maybe to demonstrate some reasons why the GM (or whoever) might make remarks of this nature. Maybe just because I like to talk (or type) about stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222627/#Comment_222627" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T01:53:05+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  1:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2009 2:01PM by Simon_Rogers.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are different approaches for different games. In my long-running D&amp;D game, I was in charge of the setting. It is what I call black box GM'ing.  Incorporation was present, but not direct, for example "is there an X here?" Any "your character could not do that's" are dealt with quickly, and we allow players to backtrack if their actions were relying on something working which can't. There is no "should not", but I'll certainly warn people of the consequences of their choices. Introducing new players is not tricky; you simply make their characters unfamiliar with the world, so the player's ignorance is the character' ignorance. It also allows them to do things that are socially unacceptable in a plausible fashion.<br>\n<br>\nIn other games, we all add and incorporate material quite openly. It depends on the players and the system. I think there are a number of people who frequent story games who have either had bad experiences or no experience at all in black box GM'ing, and they all want to have an open say in inventing material. Dare I say it, they appear to be a little sensitive about this issue. I think they are missing out. Playing Mortal Coil and black-box D&amp;D are very different, but I enjoy both. The latter does put more onus on the GM, and the players have to rely on the GM a lot more, but sometimes it's good to play in a world without the veil being lifted.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222651/#Comment_222651" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T05:49:02+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  5:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 5:50AM by jenskot.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: aeonite</cite>What about an RPG played with a novice who has never played a Wizard before?

End of campaign.<br/>It was quite a while before I understood GM'ing enough to recognize why not stopping them, or changing the behavior of the animal was what destroyed the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223016/#Comment_223016" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T12:34:43+00:00" title="August  6, 2009 12:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lantern314</cite>This may be oversimplifying things, but it is a viewpoint I haven't seen in the thread.<br/><br/>The first D&amp;D campaign I ever ran died a very quick death because I refused to say "your characters wouldn't do that."
