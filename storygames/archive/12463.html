The discussions intrigued me so I ended up buying the one available at the time, HeroQuest.<br/><br/>I haven't played it yet, but I really like the elegance of the system.  I've seen people make mention that they actually thought Hero Wars was a better game and I know that the 2nd ed of HeroQuest has come out recently.<br/><br/>What can you tell me about the differences between Hero Wars or Hero Quest 2nd from Hero Quest.<br/><br/>I'm trying to determine if it would be worth it to look at either of the other two.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279946/#Comment_279946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-10T01:29:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2010  1:29AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mechanically HeroQuest Core is, for me, the cleanest and perhaps closest to Robin's original vision. It pares away special rules, modifiers etc that are holdovers from old skool thinking in earlier additions. Some folks like all those modifiers etc. but a lot of us found them clunky in regular play. For example HW had edges which were supposed to reflect something that made it easier or harder to inflict damage. It was usually used for equipment. It added math, and worrying about armor vs. weapons seemed clunky in a story telling game. In HQ it was replaced by bonuses, but in practice they often cancelled, and in HQ 2, it was all dropped in favor of ability with one dramatic augment. <br/><br/>HeroQuest Core is also the only version that drops Glorantha to be generic.<br/><br/>What some folks liked in HW that they felt was missing from later editions was the more explicit premise. There were box outs with The Old World is Over... and the Hero Wars are between... with the explicit idea that at the end of the 3rd age you could explicitly shape the new. It went missing in HQ and was not going to fit on the more generic core.<br/><br/>I liked the explicit premise of HW, but prefer the clean mechanics of HQ Core (2). I think that HQ 1 was necessary to help a lot of old RQ gamers who found HW too far from their comfort zone make the transition, but for my part it was too much of a hybrid. Still some folks still prefer it, each to their own                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
