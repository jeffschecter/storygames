"Smeckley?"<br/><br/>Your pilot and navigator shared a tender, heartbreaking moment, and you gave them some privacy. You found Smeckley ripping a gigantic blue crystal from an ornamental pedestal. "We're not here to loot," you said, thinking the damn egghead is acting pretty cavalier about Heidi's impending death.<br/><br/>"No," Smeckley replied, "but we do have a mission to finish, and for that we need Heidi!" He delicately held the magnificent crystal as he hustled back to the dying pilot. "She's doomed, of course. Her organs have already failed; only love sustains her. This is a consciousness accumulator," he said, "it contains the ... essence, I suppose ... of countless dead Martian Senators. And, if my calculations are correct, soon one lovely Teutonic pilot will be joining them."<br/><br/>"That's crazy!" Hal shouted, but Heidi understood. It only took a moment.<br/><br/>You left her lifeless body behind. Strange lights whirled within the consciousness accumulator, somehow guiding us away form the horrors beneath the city and toward the shuttle bay. We entered the vast hangar at a run, ready for anything, even eager to settle a few scores with these Martian barbarians. But none of us was prepared for what awaited beyond the threshold.
