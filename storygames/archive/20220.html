If player\u2019s are regularly using their<br/>insp, they can do things to re-gain their insp, but if they aren\u2019t,<br/>the inspiration can stop flowing. Which kind of makes it so that the rule doesn\u2019t exist.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s my solution. I have a huge bowl of tokens (I use black go<br/>stones) that represent insp. I give them out to players and they can<br/>have any number of tokens. Already inspired but does something that<br/>deserves an insp token? Here, have it.<br/><br/>However, when you *use* your insp or when you give your insp away, you<br/>give away all of it!<br/>So it\u2019s still the same as in the book: you have insp or you don\u2019t have insp.<br/><br/>But that one insp can be represented by one or five or fifteen tokens,<br/>or any number.<br/><br/>I use the mental model of the insp being like jelly. You can get jelly<br/>pieces but when you receive them, they \u201cstick together\u201d.<br/><br/>This way of representing insp is only cosmetic. There\u2019s no rules<br/>changes. It might seem that it doesn\u2019t do any difference, but it has<br/>made a lot of difference. It\u2019s easier to remember to hand out insp<br/>once you can do it freely, without considering whether or not the<br/>player already had insp. I\u2019ve also seen players grab insp from the<br/>bowl and give to each other.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445796/#Comment_445796" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-26T10:17:28+00:00" title="June 26, 2015 10:17AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

Except maybe for alignment. Last week I had to talk to the players about their BIFTs, because I realized that if players don't compromise into playing a stable character, it's like the GM not compromising into creating a story that makes sense. <br/><br/>While that's doable (and probably incrediby gonzo-like fun), that's entirely a different game. Conversely, if everyone compromises to keep coherence (players keep their characters coherent and the GM keeps the world coherent) it's okey if the players go full murderhobo: the GM can just follow them popping up interesting consequences for their acts and yes, give them inspiration for creating scenes in a "Natural Born Killers" fashion. Of course, as long as everyone (including the GM) is comfortable with that.<br/><br/>Or, they can play LG or CG heroes in any fashion they want.<br/><br/>I'd certainly like to use the Inspiration rule and this is a cool option, but I'd need to find a convincing way to explain the players that more inspiration tokens doesn't change the effect of the current Inspiration rule at all. Otherwise they will probably roleplay only when they have spent it... which in turn may make some players less prone to hoard the spotlight.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445812/#Comment_445812" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-27T00:41:07+00:00" title="June 27, 2015 12:41AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, fuck alignment.

I feel iffy on the cross posting, it\u2019s not to draw an audience, it\u2019s more that I wanted to hear your guys thoughts on this way of handling insp. The thought process was more "Lalala, I post this at my page. Wait... this really makes sense at story-games!" But I kind of want to do that more... post up small rules ideas there but also start a thread here.\n<blockquote>Interesting. The number of tokens used<br/>doesn't affect anything, mechanically?

But this social cue has in practice made a huge difference.\n<blockquote>Awesome!!<br/><br/>As an aside, this is *exactly* the sort of thing there needs to be more discussion of regarding 5E.

The max amount of insp that can be in the pool is equal to the number of players using the (optional) 5e backgrounds. When someone ears insp, one insp goes to the pool. When anyone spends insp, one insp leaves the pool. " So far after three sessions, it hasn't seen much use and it's a little further from the RAW than my way.<br/><br/>The main reasoning why I set my version up as I did was to stick close to the RAW mechanically (but not cue-wise). It's fun to hand out this insp so freely! One player has a trait that his character lies constantly. So when he is lying disruptively I'm throwing the insp at him, pretend angry (but in reality: really happy because I love his flashlight-dropping shenanigans). He easily amasses five or six insp before he spends it all.\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>, do you do anything with PCs wanting to change a BIFT?</blockquote>\nThat's a good idea. One of my players seems to want that and I guess I should have a talk with him about it, it'd make his character better. He still uses one of the Phandelver pregens (after our AQ campaign ended, we started running Princes and he decided to bring back his Lost Mine PC), and one the pregen's traits doesn't really suit him (he's been using the others though).\n<blockquote>Yeah, fuck alignment. I haven't used it in D&amp;D since 2001.</blockquote>\nI use Ideals instead.

Maybe a different colour tokens for each attribute, so players can choose to gain Inspiration by dumping all their red tokens for advantage on that STR roll but, in this example, keep their blue INT tokens in reserve?<br/><br/>But really, the beauty of the system is in <i>Keeping It Simple, Silly.</i> Multiple tokens are satisfying so long as they don't make a sprawling sub-game out of the process. <br/><br/>A satisfying play-tool could be to have Inspiration indicators (green/red cards players can flip, or something) which would add meat to the process of checking/unchecking the INSP tickbox. <br/><br/>And if you were looking to add a little more to it you could even go as far to rule that no one can spend their INSP until everyone has it: So, hypothetically, players should be keen to flip their card and then move the spotlight to whoever's struggling to "go green." And players who don't want to spend their INSP when all the lights are on get rewarded by having their cards already green when the next round begins. <br/>  The fictional context for this, if you're asking Richardo, would be the party's teamwork and coordination getting results - and I was always into D&amp;D being about The Team rather than The Hero anyway.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445876/#Comment_445876" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-01T17:39:37+00:00" title="July  1, 2015  5:39PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I can't really affect how hard/easy their lives are once the session has started, or at least I don't think I can.

This happened to my party, composed half by newcomers and half by hardcore D&amp;D players. One of the hardcore players (now absent from the group because of work) was a natural born murderhobo. I'm not sure how much of his behavior became the norm for the rest of the players, even when he was gone; but I believe that as we were playing a campaign without BIFTs nor alignments, even without him it would have been the natural course of the game seeing the PCs start to play as chaotic evil guys. One or two of the other hardcore players started to play as if he was chaotic good in reaction to that, but left to their own devices, probably all the new players would be now pillaging through the setting instead of doing quests.<br/><br/>This idea of mine has its origin in the real world: criminals are usually people whose principles doesn't consider respect for others in many different levels, nor think much of the consequences of their actions. Take principles out of people, have them relax about the seriousness of the consequences in the short and long term and probably half of them or more will find hilarious to release their stress through a life of crime and gratuitous violence. At least until their needs are satisfied, being the more important for them, their need for fun.<br/><br/>Despite my impression on what happened with my group (I might be wrong, probably their reaction was just the result of miscommunication and my lack of skills portraying non-threathening NPCs), I actually agree that this is something that shouldn't be pushed. Even playing the game in murderhobo-mode isn't "playing it wrong" (some people just love GTA and Saints row) but another form of fun. It's just that BIFTs do help a lot the GM to provide material to create a consistent story around the PCs and keep giving the players quests and situations that actualy catch their interest. I take them as a compromise the players make to have somewhat stable characters, whatever they choose to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445980/#Comment_445980" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-06T08:01:15+00:00" title="July  6, 2015  8:01AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I actually agree that this is something that shouldn't be pushed.

Your goals may change as the campaign progresses" was the setup) and it led to very interesting and rewarding play. Just exploring the dungeon, fighting skellies and finding traps was fun on it's own.<br/><br/>I really love getting into character and so do most people I play with.

Everyone will interpret their BIFTs (or use them selectively) in a way that's unique to them.

I run the monsters from the book by the book but the players always jam everything up like crazy and make me laugh with their antics. They're often confused about who's good and who's evil in a situation (often the <i>player</i> has figured out the truth but they make their <i>character</i> confused).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445997/#Comment_445997" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-06T15:25:38+00:00" title="July  6, 2015  3:25PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also okey with that, though I always have to keep an eye open when that threatens to ruin another player's fun. By "stable" I didn't mean predictable (I've been trying lately to stay away from predicting what my players would do in a given situation, as that always tempts me to railroad a bit too much) it's more like BIFTs can be used sometimes as Fate Aspects, that the GM can compel to make the player's story more dramatic or complicated, as well as something the players can interpretate as they like, to gain some advantage or having their fun.<br/><br/>I refer to that as "stable" mostly because on the past sessions with my group I haven't been able to understand why would, say, a paladin rescue a baby and not return them to their parents, deciding instead to give them to someone who would train the boy as a blacksmith... to have him make weapons for the party. Right after that I started thinking seriously that I should be using BIFTs more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
