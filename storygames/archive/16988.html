Combat is built for everyone to always be taking the optimal action to beat the enemy, and that means that on your turn you're going to be sorting through your powers (tough if they're on cards, even harder if you're page-flipping, incredibly hard if you only have one or two copies of the appropriate book or if you have 5 books to flip through) for the best one - EVERY turn, and every one of your teammates will do the same. Couple this with off-turn actions, the Immediate Reactions and Interrupts, and now after every action everyone involved is looking through every one of their powers to see if they can stop it or react to it. This is compounded by the fact that, even when you're not rifling through powers, you still take a bit of time to think about what you're actually trying to accomplish before you even get to HOW you want to do that.<br/>This can make for some very strategy-building play that potentially has the players all collaborating to try to take down an encounter, but it does make the game run very slowly. Hence why probably the second-most-common house rule I've heard of is to put a time limit on each turn.<br/><br/>Keeping track of miniatures wouldn't be so bad if there weren't a lot of fiddly conditions to keep track of on them individually - 4e did a good job of easing the issue of "when does it go away" by restricting to end of next turn and "save ends", but there's a lot of tiny conditions and modifiers being tossed around by Zones from the Controllers, Marking by the defenders, buffs and such from the Leaders, and the targeting mechanics of the Strikers (eg Hunter's Quarry or Warlock's Curse). So when you're making actions, even once you've determined the power to be used, whether there's any interrupts or reactions, and you know what you're doing, you have to look around and see if there's conditions or terrain or whatever changing things. 3.5 and Pathfinder have this to a degree, but in my estimation it was less common.<br/><br/>And probably the other big factor is the HP to damage ratio. Monsters that aren't minions, especially solo monsters, are huge bags of health and you do vastly less damage than you would average in 3.5 or Pathfinder, or at least vastly less than my group would average. During development, they said they recognized that combat being over in like 5 rounds was an issue, and they seem to have extended it by making monsters take a million hits. Add this to the fact that individual turns take forever and your combats take a very, VERY long time. This piece is why probably THE most common house rule is to half your monsters' hp and double their damage.<br/><br/>Now, maybe I'm wrong. We didn't play 4e for long either of the times we tried it out - we ran into this issue, speed. I'm also guessing that familiarity over time with your own powers will do quite a bit to speed things up. But this is what I've worked out as the problems behind speed for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386344/#Comment_386344" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T20:34:51+00:00" title="August  3, 2012  8:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for a very detailed reply!<br/><br/>I played Pathfinder's <i>Kingmaker</i> campaign up through ninth level.  My character was a debuffer (Hedge Witch) and the party also had a buffer (Bard).  For my own personal taste, combat seemed slow and overly detailed, for similar reasons.<br/><br/>(a) Not every Player was familiar with their PC's powers.  Choosing which action to take could take time.<br/><br/>(b) The game has too many rules.  For example, the Bard tries  to intimidate a troll.  Does this work?  The Player of the Bard looks up his numeric skill value and adds this to the roll of a d20.  By how much does he exceed the target number?  What was the formula for that seldom-used skill's target number again (flip pages)?  Oh yeah, the troll is of a bigger size category, does that matter (flip pages again)?  Does it matter that the Bard and troll speak different languages (flip pages again)?  Etc.<br/><br/>(c) The game had too many numbers.  To that same intimidate attempt we increase the Bard's total by a bit because he is orating and has recently cast Good Hope.  We also add a bit because a cohort is aiding the Bard's attempt.  We also reduce the target number because the Witch has used her Evil Eye on the troll.  Etc.<br/><br/>(d) The game had too many flavors of numbers.  Bonuses to die rolls could be flavored as "morale", "competence", "enhancement", "luck", "sacred", or a half dozen other adjectives.  With one exception bonuses of the same flavor did not stack: only the higher counted.  So not only were we awash with modifiers, but we also had to keep track of which modifiers played nice with each other.<br/><br/>(e) The out-of-turn actions.  These happened rarely, since our PCs happened to have few out-of-turn powers.  Most common was how the Bard could stop orating out-of-turn to allow any ally to retry a saving throw die roll.<br/><br/>It seemed absurd to me that the Player of our party's Fighter made up a spreadsheet to alter his to-hit and damage formulas based upon the plethora of common circumstances.  (He was usually benefiting from one or more of Inspire Courage, Good Hope, Enlarge Person, Bless, Prayer, Guidance, Aid Another,...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386346/#Comment_386346" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T21:19:53+00:00" title="August  3, 2012  9:19PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No problem! Been thinking a lot about 4e's issues in some of my examinations of D&amp;D Next so it's been on my mind.<br/><br/>Oh, both a buffer and a debuffer is a nasty combo for speed. I guess a very simple way of stating it is that 4e is like every character is playing a different flavor of 3.5/Pathfinder caster. Of those issues that came up in your Pathfinder game they're very similar to the issues of 4e with a couple key differences. 4e seems to have done an admirable job of simplifying all the number flavors down to a pretty small list, though I can't think of them off-hand. However, yeah, off-turn actions are a much bigger thing, though it takes a couple levels to get them. A character built around capitalizing on them would slow the game immensely - of course, 3.5/Pathfinder had its own characters who could be built to slow down the game, namely any major Summoners or Zookeeper Druids.<br/>As for too many rules, it didn't move back or forward but laterally instead. Instead of a ton of tiny rules, it seems to be a core set of simple across-the-board rules, but so many powers make tiny exceptions to these rules so you're still looking 'em up for what they do. Exceptions-based rules design is interesting, but it didn't do much to prevent tons of fiddly bits (though if you make Power Cards it cuts down on page-flipping at least).<br/><br/>Thankfully, unlike 3.5/Pathfinder, 4e eventually stops getting longer and longer as your levels raise, thanks to a maximum number of powers that after that point you start swapping instead of adding new powers, unlike 3.5/PF's wizards and, worse, 3.5's Clerics who just get more and more and more spells as you level.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, the Essentials stuff DID take a bit of the speed issue away, mostly by making classes look a little more 3.5-ish, and generally lessening the total number of powers you have to throw around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386376/#Comment_386376" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T15:16:53+00:00" title="August  4, 2012  3:16PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my very limited experience of 4E, each battle lasted a hour at least, "boss battles" lasting longer. This was low level play (thus, each player had only a short list of Powers to parse before setting on their move) and everybody in the group was psyched about the game, with very optimized characters, thinking up tactics when it was not their own turn (or they weren't at the game), plus we coordinated well: I think we were fast thinkers and waltzed through most battles comparatively fast, crushing and humiliating our (balanced) opposition with ease. Since we were using 2x experience rules, I think there were five or six encounters to an adventure? Outside of battles (or skill challenges) we only played short, colorful vignettes which set us up for the next combat encounter. This way, it still took us three sessions per experience level - meeting every other week. It was way too slow for people used to a variety of role-playing games, and our enthusiasm for 4E soon died out.<br/>(As a point of comparison, though, my own experience with 3E, which lasted six or seven years of near-weekly play, was that it was even slower.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386377/#Comment_386377" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T15:29:13+00:00" title="August  4, 2012  3:29PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, it doesn't take that long once you have it figured out.

The second thing I would do would be to cut down on fiddly little modifiers as much as possible. One of the things that D&amp;D Next definitely did right was to introduce the Advantage/Disadvantage system that lets you do away with most of those.<br/><br/>The ratio of HP to damage was definitely off. It got significantly better as of Monster Manual 3, but probably could still use some fine-tuning all the same.<br/><br/>And there is a definitely learning curve, both for the game overall and for any given class. A group that's practiced with the rules and on the ball deciding what to do can play significantly faster, while one player who doesn't pay attention and takes time to decide what to use can make things grind to a halt.<br/><br/>I think overall 4e has the basis of a good game, but there are certain things about it where the designers don't seem to have fully considered their practical effects at the game table. The warlock's curse is a perfect example; a warlock will likely put curses on several enemies over the course of a battle, yet the designers seemingly gave zero thought to how you would track who was and wasn't cursed during play. (My group has a box of colored rubber bands for that sort of thing.) They got better about it in Essentials, as evidenced by the switch from defender marking to defender auras, but still have a long way to go. On top of that they're hampered by D&amp;D sacred cows, considering we're talking about a game that has the 3-18 type attribute scores <i>entirely</i> as a legacy thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386390/#Comment_386390" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T22:11:25+00:00" title="August  4, 2012 10:11PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with most of what's been said here*. Two additions:<br/><br/>-One of the things that makes combat fun and interesting but that can also slow it down is having fun and interesting battlefields: difficult terrain, obstacles, auto-sliding squares, etc., are all neat, but often serve to add rounds to an encounter.<br/><br/>-Although it would be tough to track, "save ends" DCs should in my opinion go more like 12, 10, 8, ... or even 14, 12, 10, 8, ... Making the DC static means a not-insignificant chance that you Just. Can't. Save. I once had a Solo monster mind-rape one of my PCs into being its minion for like 7 rounds. Totally sucked for the player, though fortunately she was a good sport about it. And, on the other hand, too often enemies save right away**, so "save ends" conditions imposed on them by the PCs are only of marginal utility.<br/><br/>One house rule I introduced, that I wish were more popular (though I like the lowering monster HP and increasing damage, and also shot-clock rules) is the +1 tokens. Any time you missed a d20 roll by 1, you got a +1 token you could spend on any future d20 roll, after rolling. And yes, you could save them, and use more than one at a time if you wanted. This really reduced the frustration factor of missing by 1 (and that happens 5% of the time, remember, so it's as common as a crit!), and allowed players to hoard them and spend a bunch on a crucial roll or if they were tired of having a condition or whatever. Note that this also sped things up slightly.<br/><br/>The +1 token rule also served as a nice "color pacing" mechanic. As everyone knows, you get narration fatigue right quick if you try to narrate every blow in a game as dense as 4E. My rule was, any time you earn or spend a +1 token, give a little bit of color describing how you just missed / just managed to hit. Some of my players took to it more than others, of course, but it definitely fulfilled its purpose of spacing out how often you had to narrate something interesting, without making you do it All. The. Time.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*I don't think 4E is in any way worse than 3E in terms of pacing; at higher levels it's downright faster.<br/><br/>**I'm also not fond of the way solos get +5 to their saves! +2 for elites is appropriate, to my mind, but +5 is a bridge too far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_386391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386391/#Comment_386391" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-04T22:54:40+00:00" title="August  4, 2012 10:54PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2012 10:56PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...

It is vitally important for the gamesmith to control the pacing of play. Ideally your players should have great tools for varying the speed in which the fiction is produced. But the production of fictional content should never be brought to a full stop. Keep the pace, keep the flow!<br/><br/>Why is it so important? There are two main reasons ...<br/><br/>1 - Dynamic pacing may be used to strengthen how players experience scenes and conflicts in the game; it may strengthen the emotional content of the game<br/><br/>2 - RPG-interaction is, ultimately, about the production of fiction; and that has to be done with a certain speed; if not the players will loose contact with the narrative<br/><br/>A lot of gamesmiths do not know this. I hope the team behind D&amp;D have learned their lesson in this field of design by failing so badly with 4E, and that they have the wits to come up with something better ...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386393/#Comment_386393" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-05T00:36:39+00:00" title="August  5, 2012 12:36AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Under no conceivable definition of "failure" could D&amp;D4 be said to have failed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386395/#Comment_386395" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-05T01:10:03+00:00" title="August  5, 2012  1:10AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the three times I played it, my peoples memorized our favorite tricks and when to use them.

I am not saying that one is better than the other, because I don't believe that. I am also not saying that 4e as a whole doesn't push people towards the former, because I think it does. Note: as a whole; the culture, WotC's modules, the rulebooks, the whole thing. <br/><br/>However, if you want to speed up play, convince everyone to skip the bit where they try to figure out the optimal thing to do and that's what the characters do. 4e combat does not break if people don't play optimally! I can't emphasize that enough. I spent a solid year playing and running over 100 games of LFR with groups of wildly varying tactical skill, and you had to be really really bad before combat started breaking. <br/><br/>Combat actually breaks worse with optimizers. That's when you get those distorted fights when the ranger uses her action points and the wizard locks down the whole battlefield and the monsters don't even get to take actions.<br/><br/>So: first think about your character's emotional state, then choose the action that fits best. Combat will go quicker. Promise.<br/><br/>There are also things that are just slow.

I've got a player who's like that. Really rises to the narrative occasion if he's in the right role, but he's just like that - well, he eventually figured out the basic system bits, but dang am I glad to not have to answer "Which one is the d10 again?" after 4 years of gaming. But you're absolutely right, players like that aren't the fault of the game. <br/>However, 4e more than some games does require a significant amount of commitment to really understand your capabilities - in 3.5 or PF Daniel could manage a fighter (or a barbarian was even more his speed) whereas 4e effectively requires all the players to put up the same amount of memorization as 3.5's spellcasters did, and he's just not into the system enough to put in that much effort.<br/>I guess what that means is that it works if played with the right group, but the "right group" can be a little harder to find since it's much rougher/slower unless everyone commits to fully understanding their character's capabilities, whereas 3.5/PF had paths to accommodate mindless play.<br/><br/>Also, as a quick aside from that, Matt said "One of the things that makes combat fun and interesting but that can also slow it down is having fun and interesting battlefields: difficult terrain, obstacles, auto-sliding squares, etc., are all neat, but often serve to add rounds to an encounter." I absolutely agree with this - all these elements make for a dynamic, interesting battlefield that can be a lot of fun to play. It just also happens to slow it down - which isn't necessarily a bad thing if that super-tacticalness is the intention, which I think it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386432/#Comment_386432" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T02:03:50+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  2:03AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Alex, out of simple curiosity (because your experience doesn't match mine, despite identical end results): did you play "by the book" or did you house-rule stuff (for example, perhaps an idiotic example, did you use grids and miniatures)?</blockquote>\nI must admit, highlighting the almost mandatory rule for miniatures and grids for 4e was funny.

My foremost concerns in that thread were what the OP was looking for, so understand that it wasn't meant to be a "true" statement in all situations all the time.<br/><br/>1) 4E grid combat is pretty demanding. It begs you to count squares and decide some. You don't have to do this, but any tactically minded player is going to have niggling little doubts in their mind. Other games have less demanding tactical grid combat.<br/><br/>2) HP Bloat means that the game takes longer as you go up in level no matter what. Just does. Other games offer a 'faster' HP-like mechanic. Or at least one that never takes more time.<br/><br/>3) It simply isn't a system designed for speed - it has other design goals. Comparisons to tactical minis games above give you a good idea of what they really wanted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386438/#Comment_386438" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T05:36:44+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  5:36AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ales, yes, it was a dumb example, but thanks for answering my question anyway.

Also in Alex's answer to my own question I read of a sort of a "simplified" 4E, emphasizing direct damage dealing (a rush to end the battle fast) over teamplay to effectively neutralize opponents (effectively ending battles before their over - which is the proper way to play, of course), which is IMO like playing 4E with handcuffs.<br/><br/>\u2665 3E was just as reliant on exact positioning, at least at low-to-mid levels, before high-level spellcasting kicks in and allows perfect encounter avoidance, instant save-or-die slaughter, etc. 3E was just as complicated and just as slow as 4E, though it's true it included some "kiddie" classes (like the Fighter!) which possessed no significant ability whatsoever and therefore cut down on decision-making time ("I attack it again, duh!"). 4E battles are just low/mid-level 3E battles made better, and a bit more varied (there were other things going on with 3E, besides battles, which 4E did not pick up, but the OSR movement got us covered there).<br/><br/>\u2665 Most of my (long and painful) experience with 3E was in group where the <i>best</i> players were like Alex's, while some of the worst ones, yes, they had a problem remembering how to roll a skill check. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>  (Most of them great people I think I'd have a blast playing shorter, faster and better-designed games with, though, I'll add.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386441/#Comment_386441" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T05:53:40+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  5:53AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alas, Steve, I played Warhammer in the past and I think it is a much, much inferior tactical game than 4E. Same goes for WarhammerQuest (which was fun, though). I don't have any experience with Mordheim/Necromunda, but the insistence by GW to sticking to the same base mechanics and stat spread (and die size) makes me suspect they are really more of the same.<br/><br/>4E has a lot of problems, chief among them the fact that progression is only marginally meaningful and that the game tends to break after circa level 16 due to the unpredictable interactions of the thousands of powers/effects in the game... but it's still on another level than any of the warhammer games.<br/><br/>As I'm fond to remind when talking 4E... consider I went in without any emotional attachment to the DnD brand/experience, without any past experience in highly tactical step-on-up gaming, and with zero disposition to go and tweak and optimize... and instead discovered that if you give me a good game and the right company (*) I enjoy it A LOT.<br/><br/>* ...and the right tools: 4E without the Character Builder is simply unbearable. Too many options, too many books, too many recalculations when changing levels, too heavy burden of experimenting with the build across the levels before reaching. Oh, and the CharOp forums: invaluable, even if you don't plan on building a super-optimized character (I generally find them a bit boring).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386447/#Comment_386447" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T06:38:15+00:00" title="August  6, 2012  6:38AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the treadmill effect is really awful.

Play Pandemic, complete a game in 25 minutes and play again, play at least 3-4 games in a row.<br/><br/>As for the speed of 4E's combat... I don't know. I felt it could be improved, especially reducing many of the on-the-spot calculations, but again, having played WHFRP and WH40K in the past I felt the rounds kept moving much more smoothly than in GW the games. Even more importantly, the team dynamics and tactics in 4E meant I had to pay attention to the other people's turns, remaining engaged with the game.<br/>I also keep hearing about people finding 4E unbearably slow, though, so it might well be that we're hitting a "different groups, different skills, different perceptions" wall.<br/><br/>...all of this without even considering the "why did WotC make DnD in a tactical game" which I'll not touch with a 3 yard stick.

GW simply doesn't seem to care: <b>as long as the minis sell</b>, why bother?</blockquote>\nYou're kinda on the right track here, especially the bolded part. <br/><br/>GW sells miniatures, and they are very good at it. And, frankly, good for them.<br/><br/>Their rules ( think what you will about them), their promoted playstyle, and their promotional/marketing style all circle back to that central core business and supports it.<br/><br/>WotC's design doesn't. They've designed in the negative. Their design is a PITA if you <b>don't</b> use some kind of positional markers, but at the higher level, they don't particularly give you a reason to actually go out and buy miniatures (or their miniatures specifically).<br/><br/>It must give Hasbro fits. Here's a company already able to produce miniatures and distribute them on a scale that no other owner of D&amp;D was able to do, and they can't get their shit together to really take advantage of that market potential.<br/><br/>A couple of key points:<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miniatures gamers like miniatures games because they use miniatures.</span><br/><br/>Yeah, I know that last sentence is a wonder of circular reasoning, but it's fundamentally true. Miniatures gamers dig the toy quality of the minis. If they didn't, they'd be board gamers. God knows boardgaming combat games are cheaper and easier to carry around.<br/><br/>WotC has basically designed some board game styles rules, and simply hoped for the best that people will buy minis. That one is largely a non-starter. That they haven't come up with a way to encourage non-GM players to buy minis doesn't help either.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why not make rules to play muliple battles in an afternoon, like the way board games are set up?</span><br/>Companies that aren't first and foremost miniatures-selling companies have done exactly that. The well regarded indie minis game producer Ganesha Games classically designs their games to be able to have multiple battles over an afternoon. Notably, the main designer doesn't sell miniatures and thus doesn't have that as an objective.<br/><br/>The vast majority of minis rules that exist are short(ish) and simple and are not tied to selling specific minis. The exceptions tend to be the odd games out, but are money-makers because of it.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When you play, you advertise, so keep the advertisement going already!</span>Look, you can buy GW minis, and you can meet up with your pals at home and have a nice big bash. Chances are go though that you'll at least once in a while end up playing out a big bash at the FLGS. The FLGS that sells the minis. On a table near where those minis are sold.<br/><br/>A big battle with nicely painted toy soldiers and bitty trees and houses just plain looks cool. It's a great visual. People who don't know what gaming is "get it" just by standing of and observing.<i> It looks like playing with toys and playing a game too, because that's what it is.</i> You play the game and you also advertise for the game at the same time for any curious onlookers like mom and dad (the folks with the purse) and little Jimmy or Janie. And they grok it in a way that they don't with rpgs or even collectible card games.<br/><br/>Having a slow playing battle with a ton of minis on the table top plays back into this whole thing.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But oh lord why!?! Why have those crazy long battles at all????</span><br/>For the same reason that the bulk of RPGs in the world are designed for long sessions and repeated, return play. Because you, the player, have put time and effort into your character and as the GM, into the setting and situation. It's the same thing with that miniatures army.<br/><br/>Why not play a game that only lasts 45 minutes and your character could end up dead real quick?<br/><br/>Well, because for most people, that would suck.<br/><br/>It becomes even more true when the rpg involves a fair amount of Lonely Fun that only comes together to becomes Group Fun occasionally, a lot like what tended to happen with OWoD games back in their heyday. Minis games where you collect and build and paint your personal army work on a similar mentality, possibly involving even greater amounts of lonely fun and (perhaps) even more hard earned cash.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So fine GW is explained, but not D&amp;D 4e...</span><br/>D&amp;D is currently owned by people who are trying to satisfy multiple masters ( fans and corporate) and trying to make a profit doing it. It's leading to a chaotic approach to the whole thing, where competing impulses are working against each other, rather than supporting one another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386518/#Comment_386518" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-06T22:06:32+00:00" title="August  6, 2012 10:06PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, hey, here's another super-important thing related to speed and 4E.<br/><br/>How much time does the average 4E play group spend asking each other if their attacks hit?

I don't buy that that's a wise and healthy way to conduct business. Then again, GW has been risking blowing up for a long time, I gather.<br/><br/>Oh and about 4E not needing minis... <i>hell to the yeah man</i>! Our group never used minis: we made custom tokens with washers, with our character's portraits on, plus several sets with "monster role" icons and an id number (soldier, shikmisher, solo, lurker, etc.). From WotC's bottom line POV, yeah, they made some design/business error because that's minis that they definitely won't sell.

Even if you do like minis, you're still better off, as a character player, going out and simply buying a single character figure from some company like Reaper rather than buying a random pack or even one of those hero packs.<br/><br/>Part of how <i>My-Army-Menz vs. Your-Army-Menz</i> type minis games in the style of GW games work on the business level is by encouraging <b>all</b> players to buy stuff. White Wolf stumbled into this formula as an RPG company with the player geared cheap splatbook concept.<br/><br/>The DDM collectible game was an attempt to give people a reason to buy random packs based on the MtG model. I suspect they hoped it would all tie back to RPG D&amp;D. It doesn't seem to have made that leap.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D boardgames seem to have gained some traction with fans of different sorts of games, although I have no personal love for them and find they move almost as slow as RPG D&amp;D combat.<br/><br/>At this point, WotC as a division of Hasbro, might be better off rereleasing those DDM miniatures as toys to the broader public with the D&amp;D logo on them, without any sort of game anything attached and market them to nostalgic, no-longer-gamer parents who played D&amp;D as kids.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><i> Of course, were I in charge of Hasbro, I'd also dump the idea of PnP D&amp;D as a viable source of worthwhile profits and change it over to a support/promotional arm for selling toys, something that probably would be more profitable overall. Geez, everybody and their brother ends up pirating the written word these days, so just give that shit away for something like D&amp;D. It would also kill the concept of edition warring: Play whatever the hell version of the game you want, oh and, btw, we have these sixty'leven other games and activities you can do with your littlemenz. Heck, why don't <b>you</b> tell us about how you play with yur littlemenz and what stories/worlds you make up, and we'll post 'em up on the company site!</i><br/><br/>3 fast games vs 1 slow game: I don't exactly know the reasons behind it psychologically, but from what I have seen ( and it becomes a dain-bramaged chicken/egg sort of mystery), faster playing games don't tend to produce the same urge in fans to pretty things up on the tabletop (creating onlooker visual appeal) or to develop other sorts of gamer cultural ties. Long, clunky, and a bit convoluted actually seems to encourage a type of fanbase building.

There are some fundamental relationships between the number of toys you can setup and move in a given time-frame. Short wargames tend to have few pieces and thus lack the visual impact of a wall-o-figs. Once you have gone to the play-time + effort of setting up that wall-o-figs it is a waste (ie it limits play options + depth) to pack it all away in an hour.  That is not to say there aren't great 1-hour wargames (eg SoBH, DBA) but they scratch a different itch. I also agree the design is very limited in the GW stuff, most of their rules are firmly rooted in 1960s concepts + procedures,  but it is not the rules that allow them to sell the figs!<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386614/#Comment_386614" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-07T19:32:11+00:00" title="August  7, 2012  7:32PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 4e does not move slowly relative to D&amp;D 3.5e.

They look pretty enticing.<br/><br/>Rob: I think GW consciously decided to go back to 1960s roots. When they were beginning to put out their main lines, minis wargaming rules were reaching a point of niche echo-chamber rules bloating. Weirdly, a lot more of that sort of rules bloat ended up passing over to RPGs for a while, even as minis games were re-discovering simpler, earlier styles of rules. But then the same bloat phenomenon ended up following GW anyway, for several cycles of their rule design and redesign.<br/><br/>Beyond just the spectacle of of masses of the littlemenz themself, lengthy games also seem to encourage a lot more attention to the play surface/terrain/table layout and it's visual quality/appeal. Probably not always true, but I even notice that I do it myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_386650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386650/#Comment_386650" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-08T10:23:56+00:00" title="August  8, 2012 10:23AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2012 10:24AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm utterly confused by any statement which holds up 3.5e as some sort of model for streamlined play.</blockquote>So am I!

If you really have the answer to prove it, tell us so the ignorant can be informed. I'm being sincere when I ask that unlike a lot of these people who ask that rhetorically to be flippant.<br/><br/>There are several products outside RPGs that are stopped to be rebranded later, mainly video games from what I remember. Most of the time first editions of RPGs have a short life span due to being the equivalent of open betas you have the option to buy.<br/><br/>Much love, brodog.

(I guess it is left as an exercise to the reader why any human being would care, but whatever.) <br/><br/>Just saying this theory out loud is enough to show how ridiculous it is, since 1) no they aren't, 2) business plans often take into account selling faster or slower, 3) business plans are not made public by virtually anyone in the RPG business even if they do write them, 4) business plans never survive contact with the enemy - the consumer, 5) bad sales normally means games are killed, not re-created in a new edition, bad sales means they're dumped.<br/><br/>But let's assume we can prove ALL the false antecedents of this theory and all RPGs are produced on a business plan that have just one single timeline, and we could know this. Let's just glance at a few pieces of the hobby and see if this is true:<br/><br/>D&amp;D first edition came out in 1973. D&amp;D Basic Set, a completely different style of game and presentation came out in 1977. 4 years. Therefore we conclude D&amp;D first edition was a failed game, not that it was a surprise niche hit. Surely 4 years is too short a time for a D&amp;D edition to be out. D&amp;D Basic was also a complete and miserable failure since in 1981, 4 years later, a completely revamped Basic edition came out. Obviously Moldvay Basic was a miserable failure. Only 4 years! The business plan was surely shattered by Moldvay Basic's failure. Then Mentzner Basic was in 1983. ONLY TWO YEARS LATER. How did any of these people eat during this time frame. Surely none of these sold any copies. If they had, the business plan would have indicated that they would just keep reprinting the original set.  Isn't it a bad business decision to try to put new versions of your game out there if the game you have is selling really well? I guess so.  <br/><br/>Tomas is right, D&amp;D brings out religious feelings in people. 4e wasn't a game, it was a vicious personal attack. It doesn't deserve just to be canned, WotC should issue a public apology. These are not exaggerations, these are things grownup people in the world believe, sincerely, maybe even more fervently than I've put them.  But virtually all editions of D&amp;D support my point of view and show how the theory advanced above is a stupid theory.<br/><br/>But yeah, D&amp;D is special to people, so I'll use one of my other examples that has nothing whatsoever to do with D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Vampire the Masquerade, 1e.  1991. An AMAZING HIT?  One of the biggest and best hits in RPG history? Nope, actually, it didn't sell any copies whatsoever, it was a complete flop, because Vampire: the Masquerade Second Edition came out in 1992. ONLY A YEAR LATER, surely Vampire was the worst game ever to come out. Surely it didn't sell any books and thousands were piled up in Mark Rein-Bjork-Hagen's garage.  You'd think those White Wolf guys woulda learned, but they were stupid and released Werewolf: The Apocalypse in 1992 and IT was such a failure that it had to have a Second Edition in 1994, ONLY TWO YEARS LATER.  <br/><br/>In this manner it is easy to prove TSR and White Wolf never produced a successful game.<br/><br/>But they did. So the theory is wrong.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386873/#Comment_386873" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-11T11:00:19+00:00" title="August 11, 2012 11:00AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget the massive failure of Apocalypse World.

But in general, <i>in general</i> a failed RPG does not get a new edition, and <i>in general</i> successful RPGs get new editions very quickly.

You can't pre-plan your turn because your plan can easily be invalidated by the last actor in the cycle.<br/><br/>It runs slowly compared to 3E because HP are inflated.  Which, I think, was done to keep the number of decisions steady over various encounters and levels.  <br/><br/>3E can bog down in the mid-to-high levels if the players aren't keenly aware of the abilities of their characters.  This can be hard on the DM, since it's very difficult to reach that level of awareness for a single character.<br/><br/>(3E is a really strange game at high levels.
