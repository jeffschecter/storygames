Marvel Heroic system sees to be the perfect medium (at least for me) in which to explore comic book action. A bunch of friends have been hooked on Naruto for a couple of years now, and hooked me on to it, and so I thought of coming up with a hack for Marvel Heroic where Manga-esque stories (from the Naruto-verse) can be told:<br/><br/>The modifications I made to the systems were the following: <br/><br/>1. All characters get a d6 Ninja moves power set die. This narratively is all the things the characters in the manga can just do from training. This includes running really fast, jumping through trees, basic medical training, throwing kunai etc... etc..<br/><br/>2. All characters get a limit - Chakra: Shut down your powerset (most characters only have 1) and recieve a PP. Take an action against doom pool to recover.<br/><br/>3. Specialities: Ninjutsu, Taijutsu and Genjutsu each had an expert and master level, and each character could be an expert, master or non-notable spec in each category.<br/><br/>Note that these are rudimentary changes to the system, and I will be working on more, but I wanted to put this out there to get some ideas from others who have been thinking along these lines:<br/><br/>Some thoughts: <br/>a. How do summons work? A lot of characters can summon creatures to fight for them, and the summons themselves are a large scale threat. I did not make any rules and just narrated them out (and they didn't do too much), but I did not know what people had thought of them<br/><br/>b. It seems like the way Kishimoto wrote the manga, each character basically has one power with some sfx's. Have people tried to write char sheets and come into this problem ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398980/#Comment_398980" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T07:03:37+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  7:03AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the key to writing a shounen battle manga hack for anything is remembering the Rule of Three. I can't remember where I picked it up, but I think a friend of mine mentioned that it was an Oda Eichiro line.<br/>Every character must be capable of being summed up in three defining features. This isn't to say that the characters are bland, but rather instantly recognisable the moment they hit the page. This means that it works quite well with Marvel Heroic, which really breaks stuff down using the SFX system, so I think you have an idea there.<br/>I would be really tempted to make the specific Jutsu the SFX themselves, similar to I think how Marvel Heroic builds Iron Fist, though I don't have my stuff here (Whilst some characters have LOADS of jutsu, some are pretty clearly direct upgrades of previous ones).<br/>Summons I would run as an SFX where the player makes their panel move through the SFX that round. If they attacked in conjunction, maybe give them the Partner+Player's particular attack in Speciality+Summon SFX.<br/><br/>(Alternatively, I have worked out a fun, pretty barebonesy system for Shounen Manga that I could lend you, though it is primarily meant for more lighthearted situational parodies, the basic setting being the players playing the parents of Shounen protagonists having to pick up the pieces they inevitably leave behind/ find out why their children keep on missing school to go off and play in card tournaments, it could work for a more serious game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DarkMoonINC" title="DarkMoonINC"><img alt="DarkMoonINC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DarkMoonINC">DarkMoonINC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401799/#Comment_401799" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T22:49:28+00:00" title="December 26, 2012 10:49PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend of mine ran an entire campaign using the Wild Talents book as a guideline. They rebuilt all the powers into Jutsu. From what I hear not only was it absolutely amazing fun, but it works real well.<br/><br/>I'd have to say for my money I'd rather use Marvel Heroic. I have a personal obsession with Cortex Plus and I think that what James said above me is about the best advice here. Just make sure that, like my friend's game, you make sure this has a focus on fun fun fun. Because the over the top bizarre events of Naruto make for very fun gameplay.<br/><br/>Hope to see what comes out of it when you're done!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
