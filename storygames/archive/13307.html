Using Greg's Toy definition.<br/><br/>But is an RPG that's mainly a Toy bad design?<br/><br/>He says Sim City isn't a Video Game but like many RPGs, is a Toy. Is Sim City bad design? <br/><br/>If something is purposefully designed to be a Toy, how can it be bad design just because it is a Toy?<br/><br/>And does bad design mean less fun? Less popularity? Less success?<br/><br/>My opinion is that if you wanted to design a boat but ended up making a car, that's bad design. The goal determines if design is good or bad. <br/><br/>But lets say your design is bad. My boat is actually a car! Does bad design make it less successful? It depends on how we define success. Let's go with a simple measurement. Does bad design mean less people will use my car? Maybe not! 27 million people have played D&amp;D. It may be more Toy than Game, but that didn't stop millions from enjoying it. Bad design can be completely unrelated to success. <br/><br/>RPGs are Toys? Sure!<br/><br/>RPGs are bad design? Depends on your design goals. If you wanted to design a Toy, and you designed a Toy, that's good design!<br/><br/>Bad design means poor success? Depends on how you measure success. Plenty of bad designs are successful.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299623/#Comment_299623" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-06T14:17:30+00:00" title="November  6, 2010  2:17PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So your friends are saying that RPGs make for poor board games, essentially?

I have been directed to it at various occasions in the past, and have read through it many, many times.  It contains a great deal of wisdom.<br><br>But, today, I'm seeing it in a new light with respect to RPGs.<br><br>I'm thinking that the degree to which an RPG is a toy is exactly the degree to which it supports Simulationism.  In the past, Simulationism has been plagued by the problem of not having any clear definition as to its goal, or even <i>what it is</i>.  It was originally described by Ron Edwards as <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/15/" rel="nofollow">"The right to dream"</a>, and I have seen players describing its goal as exploration: exploring a world, exploring a character, exploring a system, or whatever.  Wikipedia describes it goal as simply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_Theory" rel="nofollow">"Be there"</a>.<br><br>Now I'm wondering if the problem with defining Simulationism's goal is that it doesn't have one.  In fact, that's the point.  A game that is highly Simulationist has mechanics that a player can fiddle with and explore independent of any particular goal.  And, a good Simulationist RPG is a very flexible toy to which a player can ascribe a wide variety of his own goals.  Once he does so, the RPG toy now <i>becomes</i> a game in the same way that a ball is just a toy until you decide on the goal of throwing it through a hoop while your friends try to keep you from doing so.<br/><br/>In his article Greg  Costikyan says this about Sim City:\n<blockquote><cite>Greg  Costikyan</cite><br/>And the only way to stay interested in it for very long is to turn it into a game -- by setting goals, by defining objectives for yourself. Build the grandest possible megalopolis; maximize how much your people love you; build a city that relies solely on mass transit. Whatever goal you've chosen, you've turned it into a game. </blockquote>\nLater on, he says this about RPGs:\n<blockquote><cite>Greg  Costikyan</cite><br/>"But what about roleplaying games?" you may say. "They have no victory conditions."<br/><br/>No victory conditions, true. But certainly they have goals; lots of them, you get to pick. Rack up the old experience points. Or fulfill the quest your friendly GM has just inflicted on you. Or rebuild the Imperium and stave off civilization's final collapse. Or strive toward spiritual perfection. Whatever. <br/></blockquote>\nI agree that a game that provides experience points as a reward mechanism is essentially providing a player with a goal: Rack them up and become as powerful as possible.  A game like "My Life with Master" also gives you a firm goal: overthrow the Master.  However, the goal of fulfilling "the quest your friendly GM has just inflicted on you" doesn't quite qualify as a goal given by the RPG itself.  It is a goal provided by one of the players: the GM.  Of course, in most traditional games we know that this goal is almost always going to involve killing things and taking their stuff.  But, occasionally, the GM and players will provide some other goal, such as "Rescue the Princess from the High Tower without killing anyone and without getting caught in the process".  In that kind of scenario, a game that only supports combat is likely to be a poor choice for that particular goal.  In other words, its "toy" aspects do not extend far enough to support this scenario.<br/><br/>So, I'd say that an RPG that is a flexible toy may actually be a very good design, if your design goal is to provide a system where the players provide their own goals.  It may be a very poor design, though, if your design goal is to create a system that produces interesting stories.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299883/#Comment_299883" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-08T17:56:31+00:00" title="November  8, 2010  5:56PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read the article and giving it some thought.

Both involve building things, but the model kit mostly builds a specific thing, while the Lego Kit <i>might</i> build a specific thing, but the blocks can also be used to build all kinds of other stuff too, especially as you acquire more Lego blocks, right?<br/><br/>Thinking about that old Costikiyan article though, one thing pops out at me: You can use toys as toys and enjoy them. You can also use them as the basis of a game or multiple games. It's less easy to take a game and make a toy out of it ( at least in English! Apparently other languages are smushier when it comes to different sorts of play)<br/><br/>To my mind, part of the consideration is simply commercial at the end of the day. As RPG/SG gamers, we tend to want to rules to have a dollar value if we're going to publish them at all. Basically, we have a hard time swalloiwing the bitter pill that the rules may simply not be the most valuable thing to our intended audience ( an audience that has self selected down over the last few decades).<br/><br/>On the flipside, the OWoD had a really high Toy Quality and was wildly successful. I mean jeez, that thing was ( at least to me and a lotta folks I know) mostly one big bundle of cool ideas and related accompanying cool art that said " Hey! You! Play Pretend at being monsters! They're like this and this and this! And they get along like that and that and that! And the world they live in is like this and that, except when it isn't! Go pay!"<br/><br/>And we did. Every so often, someone would bother to figure out the actual rules. Sometimes, we'd even use them.<br/><br/>Really though, isn't the real trick getting toys into the hands of people who'd use them? And presenting them as toys?<br/><br/>I mean, heck, if you're making an RPG <b>toy</b> most procedures becomes tools, and can be described in like, what, a page or two total??? They don't even need to be coherent or follow together in the text, really.<br/><br/>The trick then, to my mind, comes down to sticking on two main points:<br/>Finding the receptive audience<br/>Reconsidering the commercial goal of the producer<br/><br/>I've recommended/suggested/posited on multiple occasions that the place is in Young Reader genre books as an add on to either the actual fiction pieces or in a related book based on the property, such as those typical books in the vein of "The World of Hot Fantasy(broadly defined) Property X!!!" that seem to seem to appear inevitably whenever a series picks up commercial success.<br/><br/>As for the commercial goal of the producer, would you ( generic you) be happy with a quick couple hundred bucks for a bit of add-on writing for something along those lines? You know, some procedures-as-toys-not-quite-game bits of text that would be added into a book at the end ( a bit like the rules in Spione, actually, but less properly gamelike)? <br/><br/>Would you be happy knowing you'd encouraged some sort of Play Pretend with Procedures among younger folks, even if they never became Proper Gamers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
