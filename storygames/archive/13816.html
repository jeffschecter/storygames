In order to produce our games, we work with both a stable of awesome freelance staff and a publishing partner, Sandstorm Productions, which assists us in getting our games into print and distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Our first print run of EP under Catalyst was 3,000 copies. It debuted at Gen Con 2009, hit retail in October 2009, and sold through by January 2010. Our second print run (unfortunately an exact replica of the first printing due to a printer error), another 3,000, hit retail in June 2010, after we purchased this stock from Catalyst as we parted ways. By the end of 2010, we had sold 2376 of those copies. Altogether we have sold 5,376 copies of EP in 14 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Another measure of strength is PDF sales. We took the lower price point route on the core book PDF and sold it at $15. We did this for several reasons. For one, PDF pricing is still in flux, and $15 seems to be the upper limit on what many consumers are willing to pay. When you price a PDF at $20+ or somewhere near the print cover price, you lose people who might throw down a few bucks to check it out. We also had to balance against the fact that with our Creative Commons license, people are free to share the PDF. We are, in effect, giving it away. That said, we do think PDFs have value above print books (especially when they are bookmarked as ours are and layered for easy printing), and they do cost money beyond print production costs\u2014at least if you\u2019re doing them right. And given the thin profit margins on print publishing, PDF sales are essential for small publishers like ourselves to stay afloat. So we needed a balance between "free" and "too pricey for a PDF," a range where the people who want to support us for our work will still feel comfortable paying for a PDF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To date, after ~15 months of PDF sales, we have sold ~1,400 PDFs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This, of course, doesn\u2019t count the thousands of free, legal PDF downloads that people have made. Demonoid alone tells us that the EP core book was downloaded as a torrent at least 14,000 times (2k stand-alone and 12k as part of larger RPG bundle downloads), and that\u2019s just a single tracker. Those don\u2019t pay directly, but those are thousands of people who have been exposed to our game who might otherwise never have heard of it. Certainly some of those downloaders are reading it, playing it, and sharing it with other friends. That translates into more print and/or PDF sales, quite possibly better than any form of advertising or marketing we could do, because it costs us nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>One of the biggest features of Eclipse Phase that we like is the fact that we released it under a Creative Commons nc-by-sa license (see <a href="http://eclipsephase.com/cclicense" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://eclipsephase.com/cclicense</a>). This means that people are free to share, remix, and otherwise manipulate our text and artwork as long as they do so non-commercially, provide attribution, and license any derivative works under the same license. <br/><br/>The first practical application of this is that people can share our stuff online for free. We wholly support this and in fact encourage it\u2014we\u2019ve seeded our own files via BitTorrent. For a new and growing game line, obscurity was a far greater danger than piracy, and there is no question in our minds that the Creative Commons approach helped to expose EP to thousands of people that might otherwise have missed it. This approach is also beneficial to gaming groups, as players can easily share files with each other to make characters and get a game going. Most importantly, our fans appreciate the freedom this gives them and the fact that we don\u2019t try to punish them or treat them like criminals, and they support us even more because of it. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Our ad-hoc research indicates that many active Eclipse Phase groups are sharing the core rulebook PDF within their group and that the majority of groups have multiple copies of the print rulebook as well. By charging very reasonable prices for our PDFs and allowing groups to share them, they\u2019re better able to buy copies in print! </blockquote>\nAwesome!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312809/#Comment_312809" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T06:01:57+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  6:01AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2011 6:08AM by jenskot.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Eclipse Phase has a lot going for it</b> (in my opinion):<br/><br/>- talented, passionate, and accessible creators<br/><br/>- masterful graphic design &amp; creative direction<br/><br/>- professional layout, editing, and production<br/><br/>- exposure due to being free to share via the creative commons<br/><br/>- amazing art<br/><br/>- fully detailed and expansive setting but with plenty of timelines and bullets points to make it easy to scan through<br/><br/>- it feels like a game for mainstream RPG gamers (simulationist, traditional feeling mechanics, lots of statistics, huge setting, lots of focus on inspiring play, loose play structure, loose focus, toolkit) while adding a trans-human twist<br/><br/>- partnership with Sandstorm Productions to handle many of the business aspects of RPG publishing<br/><br/>- available for sale in a variety of formats via multiple retailers<br/><br/>- great website, they even list selling points for Players, GMs, and Retailers                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312810/#Comment_312810" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T06:06:11+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  6:06AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I stopped by their booth at GenCon.

I noticed 2 of them had independently brought laptops and were showing off Eclipse Phase to anyone who was interested (although there were no Eclipse Phase games on the schedule). One of them torrented the book but wanted to buy it if they could find a group to play with.<br/><br/>I talked to them for a bit and it was clear that Eclipse Phase was more than just a game for them, it had captured their imagination. The rules were very secondary (if that). It reminded me of being 18 and falling in love with Shadowrun. It took years before we had any idea how to actually play it. Our games were accidental freeform but we loved the setting. <br/><br/>Nowadays I'm much less into setting and like very focused rules. But I remember when I loved Shadowrun and I saw quite a bit of that same enthusiasm in those kids eyes as they talked about Eclipse Phase.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312815/#Comment_312815" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T06:47:51+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  6:47AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh it's so nice to hear about Eclipse Phase again.

Replace "intentionally uploaded their PDFs to some torrent sites" with the addendum "and allow you to download the game for free direct from their website for a while". It was very intentional, the free came out IIRC before the for-pay. It was mainly to seed the game, it seems. Sounds like it worked.<br/><br/>It is a very unusual strategy. The only game studio that I know which has done anything nearly like that is "Clinton Nixon". Something to be admired, for size of stones and all that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>If the setting is great, but the mechanics aren't, seems like the setting is screaming out for a system makeover that can be officially released.</blockquote>\nIndeed. I have a bromance with Adam Jury, so I am incapable of saying bad stuff about this game. But the mechanics really are not my cup of tea, like At All. Character Generation alone would take hours, when by all intents for the purpose of the game it should really only need to take minutes; they seem very at odds.<br/><br/>But indeed, when the game came out I pretty much said the same: That you can, in fact, lift all the text, all the artwork, create your entirely new system, and publish your own version of Eclipse Phase. In fact, I think that rings true to its futurism/transhumanism orientation. This is <b>MOTHER. FUCKING. EXCITING.</b> for people with a DIY bend. No one's done that yet (I for one simply don't have the time, else I'd go The Shadow of Yesterday all over that shit), but yes what you say is legit. In fact, I think the authors are on the edge of their seats HOPING people do that.

Any positive exposure that something unknown receives is good. That can be through piracy, or giving it away for free. But piracy can (stress \u201ccan\u201d, I\u2019m not saying definitely) hurt you if you are known and already successful or if your potential audience is tiny and already committed to buying from you. But in general, many people don\u2019t fall into these categories. For every rockstar, there are thousands of bands starving for an audience. At the same time, there are bands that have a solid, small, but rabid fanbase. Giving too much away in their case can hurt them unless giving it away is part of a larger strategy.<br/><br/>World of Warcraft wants to protect their subscription service but there is only so much room at the top. D&amp;D Online couldn\u2019t compete with WoW so they went to a Free to Play model where they make money from in game micro transactions and they increased their revenue by 500%! Free to play plus in game micro transactions has already become a billion dollar industry in Asia and growing at rampant speeds on the iPhone (granted many iPhone in game purchases are children spending their parent\u2019s money without them knowing... and hopefully this will change soon). <br/><br/>This is less about piracy and more about destroying barriers of entry so people can find and get what they want quickly. More importantly, people don\u2019t know what they want till they try it so it\u2019s beneficial to let people try with minimum or no commitment. And if people show interest in you, even through piracy, don\u2019t punish them, reward and redirect them so the relationship becomes beneficial to everyone but be ready to compromise. But it depends on the details. I\u2019m suspicious of any arguments that relies on absolutes and doesn\u2019t take into account that one size does not fit all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Jury" title="Adam Jury"><img alt="Adam Jury" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam%20Jury">Adam Jury</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313024/#Comment_313024" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T07:56:11+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  7:56AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mentioned this to walkerp over on RPG.net, too:\n<blockquote>I just want to chime in here, and say while I don't think _piracy_ has any appreciable negative effect on book sales, that "Eclipse Phase is doing well, so that proves piracy doesn't hurt" is actually not an accurate statement ... because bog-standard downloading of Eclipse Phase isn't piracy. The only way to pirate Eclipse Phase is to distribute it and violate the Creative Commons license with that distribution. And you have to be actively _trying_ to do that.<br/><br/>In other words, it's really hard to pirate Eclipse Phase, and we didn't have to spend extra money or restrict your rights to do so: instead, we gave you more rights.<br/><br/>I think that's a major win, and would be a major win even if EP wasn't successful critically and financially.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313032/#Comment_313032" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T08:34:20+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  8:34AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a bit of a semantic position, though, Adam.
