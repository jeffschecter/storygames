It's gone through a rather peculiar evolution, making so many jumps in direction and scope that, frankly, I have no idea what the hell it is, or if there'd even be any interest in such a thing.  I'll ask my questions up front, so you can think about them while you read, and hopefully give me some guidance on making my own direction a little more coherent.<br/><br/>* What is this thing I've created?<br/>* Would you, or anyone you know, use/play/mess with it?  Could anyone do anything with it but me?<br/>* When it's finished, in whatever form, what should I do with it?<br/><br/>The game began as a challenge to myself:  can I write an RPG over the course of a lunch break?  The inspiration was an image I saw on Vince Baker's blog of a mafia guy with a gun.  I decided I was going to make a light-crunch game about mafia guys on a raid.  So I hacked together some basic simulation-based mechanics, trying to keep the whole concept as rules light as possible, while still maintaining some semblance of tactical depth.  The basic mechanics are that you get four stats that roughly correspond to real-life attributes:  Strength, Speed, Perception, and Aptitude.  You also get four specializations, which are the things your character is uniquely good at, which give you a bonus.<br/><br/>You roll a d10, add the most relevant stat, and if you have a specialization that applies, you add 2.  If you beat some given target number that the GM has set either arbitrarily, or by making a defensive roll for the character on whom you're acting, you succeed.  Succeeding or failing by 4 or more makes the success/failure more pronounced.  Then you get into things like Complex Tasks (just a series of rolls back to back) and the combat/Health system, and then Resolve (+2 bonus to any roll after the fact, but they're reliable -- you either spend everything you need to succeed or don't, no BS).  That's really all there is to the mechanics. I'm not really here to discuss them *per se*, since I've already messed around with them and they work.  <br/><br/>Then I realized I failed catastrophically in my intent to create a game about mafia guys, and ended up with a generic framework to run action scenarios.  The point about the mechanics is really that they're versatile and intended to work in just about any action-oriented scenario with fine granularity of time.  That is to say, a roll tells you what's happening *now*, and every time something changes and presents an obstacle, you can make a roll to succeed (or not).  Which is great, but it's not a game at all.  You could ostensibly run a lot of contemporary stories with this.<br/><br/>The first game I actually ran with OneShot was a story inspired by Halo: ODST, dealing with a squad deployed to intervene during the Battle of Cleveland.  I've also run stories based on Firefly, and even created a full-scale "campaign setting"/game called PSICOM, about psychokinetic special forces 1000 years in the future.  (This one contains five "psionic disciplines" in which characters can specialize -- Energy, Telekinesis, Telepathy, Autohypnosis, and ESP, each of which is a slate against which the players can define powers.  Roll Aptitude, with +2 if you have a focus in the discipline, and the higher the roll, the cooler the resulting effect.)  Right now I'm working on a hack called "Measure of a Badass", whose driving concept is, metaphorically, what if the action heroes from the films and television shows of the 1980s ended up on the same team in modern times, fighting an obviously evil enemy (corporation, Cobra Command, whatever)?<br/><br/>So what is OneShot, then?  An incomplete game?  A framework?  Nothing at all?  The end result I see is that it's essentially a set of action mechanics that you can hack, *quickly*, to run any sort of action story you desire.  It isn't a game, and it's pretty much nothing until and unless you hack it.  It practically codifies "here's a thing, players, do what you want, and the GM describes the results, with the proviso that neither of you is allowed to be a dick about it."  Is that even a thing, or is it me trying to market the very concept of game design itself?  Which leaves me to wonder, what, really, is releasable about this whole thing once it's complete?  If I offered the PDF of OneShot, would you or anyone you know attempt to hack it and create a game against it?  Would it be better if I just hacked it myself and released the individual games that resulted, expanding my audience to not just game designers but GMs and gaming groups in general?  Both?  Neither?<br/><br/>I will say that there's no way I'm making money on this thing.  It's too specialized, too particular.  Honestly, it's a labor of love.  I'd love to see what your thoughts are on it, and if there's any interest in what comes out the other side.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354694/#Comment_354694" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T10:45:37+00:00" title="January 17, 2012 10:45AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I see it, it's a very simple, playable rules system.

My intention with OneShot is not to supplant GURPS; they're both generic systems, granted, but I think they speak to different people.  To be totally honest, I *don't* picture people playing long, protracted campaigns using OneShot.  It can be done, but there isn't really a system in there for rewards and advancement, short of the inherent reward of doing cool stuff and achieving your mission goals.  (In truth, that's most of the reason why it's called OneShot -- because it's intended for short stories.)<br/><br/>OneShot isn't about fast combat as much as it is about fast action in general, both in and out of game.  I try to enable that through multiple means.<br/><br/>The core mechanic, a simple d10 + stat + bonuses vs. target, resolves quickly, and essentially the GM decides what comes as a result.  No matter what, something changes, and the system specifies a degree of success, but not the actual end result.  Combat "maneuvers" are jumping off points for tactical decisionmaking without too much crunch.  I purposefully abstract away a *lot* of detail, sweeping it under the admittedly contentious blanket of "the GM decides", to facilitate that.  It's not for everyone.<br/><br/>A beneficial consequence of abstraction and keeping everything simple is that people really can start from scratch, pick up and play with minimal time invested.  An ideal scenario for play, and one I've managed on more than one occasion, is to sit down with friends who have never played an RPG before, and brainstorm an idea for an action story.  "Let's be mythical ninjas facing down a zombie invasion of historical Kyoto."  And the designated GM spends about 15 minutes hashing out a rough starting point, generates stats for monsters, concepts for player special powers (types of ninjutsu magic?  Combat forms?), and you just *go*, seeing where it ends up.  It shines more in the hands of strong improvisational GMs than people who like to heavily plan details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354766/#Comment_354766" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T17:35:23+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  5:35PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the main question about a "game" like this is:<br/><br/>What value does it give me, the customer (or fan, if it's free), that I can't get myself?<br/><br/>Why is it worth my time to download it, read it, learn it?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim D</cite>And the designated GM spends about 15 minutes hashing out a rough starting point, generates stats for monsters, concepts for player special powers (types of ninjutsu magic?

I've had a couple of GMs run this who aren't me run the game, in various stages of development.  I confess both had prior GM experience (one a very old hat, the other someone who had run a couple of sessions of d20 Modern -- though I helped him get through the mechanics of that).  The former ran a very interesting piece that I think might illustrate the game's point -- characters were built as normal, with custom special abilities, since the plot was the assembly of story book characters from various pieces of fantasy fiction.  I played Lone Wolf, who, for those unfamiliar, is essentially a psionic ranger starring in an excellent "choose-your-own-adventure" series by Joe Dever.  ("Choose your own adventure" isn't really a fair comparison; they have more to do with series like Fighting Fantasy.)<br/><br/>The "campaign" didn't get very far, but the premise was that the worlds of these stories collided and broke down in the collective consciousness of the world, due to the fading importance of literature in the youth.  The opening scene for Lone Wolf involved an attempted theft at the devastated Kai Monastery.  Lone Wolf, being the last of the Kai, certainly can't defend the place while he's off hunting for the night's meal.  Returning, he spotted the thugs trying to puzzle out a portcullis, and sneaked around to the high ground (Speed vs. Perception, success), where I declared my first special, Mind Blast.  Rolling a strong success on Aptitude vs. Aptitude (mental attack vs. mental fortitude), the GM ruled the attack knocked one of the thieves unconscious.  A chase ensued, where Lone Wolf cut the thieves off at a junction, and he attempted to snatch the stolen Book of the Magnakai from the leader (Speed vs. Speed, success); without the book, the thieves had no further purpose.  Lone Wolf drew the Dagger of Vashna and threatened the thieves (Aptitude vs. Perception, success) with a foul artifact, the only weapon that could slay a Darklord, and the thieves thought better of their presence and took off.<br/><br/>A portal and several days' travel later, Lone Wolf and his allies found themselves on Pern, interacting with a group of small dragon creatures who found him oddly fascinating.  Using Animal Kinship, Lone Wolf befriended them, and began to apply Sixth Sense to get a hunch for what their deal was.  (Aptitude vs. static target, failure).  The small dragons -- and forgive me because I don't know what they're really called -- are highly telepathic, communicating with people and their future riders effectively via empathy.  Lone Wolf found his senses overloaded and was stunned briefly before engaging Mindshield (Aptitude vs. Aptitude, success) to block out any further sensory overload.  This, of course, disturbed the dragons, since Lone Wolf had, for all intents and purposes, essentially died in an instant.  (They can't commuincate, after all.)<br/><br/>All of this was improvised, mind; we didn't spend any time figuring out *exactly* what these powers did in terms of mechanics.  I'm intending on running a one-on-one game with my fiancee as GM, so I'm hoping to see if someone who has never run a game before has similar success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354831/#Comment_354831" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T08:46:47+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  8:46AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, how differently do you think the game would have gone if we had used a different resolution mechanic?

I use a linear set of values (1d10 rather than, say, 2d6) because I want to see more strong results one way or the other, for reasons I hope become clear.  The difference between using dice versus, say, a card that reads 1-10, doesn't seem to make much of a difference in my case.<br/><br/>For the sake of argument, actions are resolved by rolling 1d10 + stat + specialization bonus + advantage/disadvantage modifiers.<br/><br/>The stat is obvious; stats are rated 1-8, with 4 being average.  Specialization bonus is used if your character has a specialization in a relevant field; add 2 to most rolls, but 1 to direct attacks/defenses (since the game is about action, which tends to emphasize combat, I want to incentivize picking abilities that are useful outside of combat.)  Specialization modifiers do not stack.  Advantage and disadvantage are ad-hoc modifiers, -4, -2, +2, and +4, which apply if you attempt a task in a situation that makes it harder or easier than usual.  (Shooting in darkness:  -2.  Tailing a loudly-painted car, or one with a flat tire:  +2.)  These stack without limit.<br/><br/>The results are interpreted as follows:<br/><br/>Fail, 0-3 margin:  Failure.  Things don't improve, and circumstances may change, requiring a different approach.<br/>Fail, 4+ margin:  Strong failure.  A complication arises -- this either makes life more difficult, or presents a new problem you must avoid.<br/>Success, 0-3 margin:  Success.  You get what you want.<br/>Success, 4+ margin:  Strong success.  You get what you want, and something more.<br/><br/>The idea is that each step flows into what happens next by necessity, since each task roll really only spans a short amount of time.<br/><br/>Picture your guy is trying to dodge a flashbang getting thrown at him.  The throw is your enemy's Perception vs. Speed; you roll a strong failure.  Well, not only are you in the blast, but you're in the center; you roll Strength vs. 12 roll to resist the stunning effect, but now you're at a disadvantage (-2) to the roll because you're sitting right next to the thing.<br/><br/>Perhaps you try to strike an opponent with a flying punch and roll a slight failure.  So you miss, but circumstances can change; the GM may decide that you missed the blow but you've instead ended up in a clinch or a grapple.  The slate of options changes moment to moment.<br/><br/>Keeping the quanta of time small keeps the game in the realm of tactics; the reason I didn't extrapolate upward one more level (and end up with a conflict resolution style in the vein of Ghost/Echo or similar) is that I want to keep that feel -- the Tom Clancy-style blow-by-blow exchanges, with the mechanics streamlined to keep a very quick pace and flow to the action.  That's one of the keys to the way the game is supposed to work -- flow.  Abstraction keeps the game moving quickly, so things change at a rapid pace.  The players are constantly re-evaluating and making quick choices both in terms of game time and real-world time, trying to keep their advantage, which keeps them engaged and "on the edge of their seat", reinforcing the action.<br/><br/>(Let me know if I went to Mars there and missed the point of your question, but hopefully that should explain where I'm going.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
