                    Breakoff from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2465" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.<br/><br/>So, uh, I do this. I have fun with Psuedo-Play. I have so-called "Lonely Fun."  It's by no means the only kind of fun I have with RPGs - I enjoy playing with my group and I'm not dissing that here. But there's this attitude I see here a lot, that there's something fundementally wrong with Psuedo-play, and I'm bothered by it. <br/><br/>I play a mix of so-called 'Story-Games' and 'Traditionals' (in my case, D&amp;D3.5). My life, and the lives of my players, mean we don't get to play as much as we did when we were teenagers, and we're OK with that. Sometimes its only two weeks between games, sometimes it has been months. In that intervening period, why should I be ashamed of spending some time playing around with the system when I find a couple of hours by myself one night?   Nothing to show for it, you say? So what? What more would I have to show for it if I watched a movie or played a computer game? What's the stigma, exactly? <br/><br/>When I take the Briggs-Meyers test, I'm always an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP" rel="nofollow">INTP</a>. "INTP types are quiet, thoughtful individuals who don't mind spending long periods of time on their own working through problems and forming solutions. They are very curious about systems and how things work..." It appeals to me to spend time by myself, and I enjoy imagining elements of play outside of play. <br/><br/>Sometimes, here and in other online communities about RPGs, I see it said that "The only thing that matters is Play", but I don't agree. I think Fun is more vital than Play. I enjoy playing - it's Fun. But if I can also get Fun out of spending an evening rolling up treasure on <a href="http://www.random-generator.com" rel="nofollow">Abulafia</a>, why shouldn't I?                </div>

                            Dave, I hear you. I'm at a place in my life where I don't get a lot of opportunity to play, but I find the "lonely fun" stuff still engaging. As others have said, there's a lot of the Dirty Hippy games where it's really not very helpful or even counterproductive... but there's also lots of places where it is. I built a whole quadrant for a Space Opera game that I knew would probably not happen - because I like the process of smashing the output of random generation up against a particular set of color and situation requirements and seeing what comes out the other side. I fiddle with variants for TSOY all the time, and I think it helps me "get" how the game works. When I get a new game, I need to fiddle with it solitaire for a while in order to internalize how it works.<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It's toxic when it takes over your actual play - when you're in love with your prep and don't want to let those nasty other players mess it all up with their stupid choices.                        </div>

                            Is there supposed to be a stigma?<br/>
<br/>
The thread you've pointed to described lonely-fun-play (pretty fairly, I thought) and then asks for examples of story-games that support it.  Examples are given.  People talk about them in a positive way.  Posters caution that we shouldn't apply "pseudo-play" in a condescending way, and (to my mind) people don't.<br/>
<br/>
I think people are in favor of it, and looking to see where this type of fun can be better supported by story games.                        </div>

                            I have tons of lonely fun.  These days (since October) it comes from Final Fantasy XII, but pretty soon I'll have exhausted that and moved on to Ar Tonelico and after that Legend Of Zelda: the Twilight Princess when I can find a sodding Wii for sale.<br><br>Saying "Pseudo Play" is somehow bad or shameful is like saying that doing anything other than playing story games in your spare time is shameful.

Hey Dave, I find it interesting you are INTP. For many years I tested that also, as I have mellowed out a bit shifted to INFP, but I know what you mean. Curious to me would be the SG vs Trad RPGers in Meyers-Briggs terms.<br/>Thanks for the post.                        </div>

                            i think there is a stigma preseant, and i don't think there should be. I also think that the best way to combat that stigma designers should embrace this facet of play and make games that more effectivly cater to it. If there are a couple of games that say "here, play this alone for a little while, or even for the life of the game," it would be looked down on less.                        </div>

                            I don't think that there's a stigma present, I just don't write games for that sort of play.<br/><br/>No value judgement.  Imagine a pasta chef.  Someone asks "what about people who want to eat dessert?"  The chef says "that's cool, but I don't recommend using pasta for it."<br/><br/>I used to pseudo-play a lot.  I don't much anymore, simply because I have a lot of actual play in my life and I prefer actual play to pseudo-play.  When I have less actual play in my life, I fill it in with pseudo-play (various complicated LARP systems, Sorcerer, The Shadow of Yesterday, mostly.)<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

Oh, absolutely. I grew up playing D&amp;D with a DM whose campaign world was based on 'His Books.' As in, the fantasy books he wanted to write (and had started, in longhand, in notebooks) as knockoffs of Dragonlance. Whatever we messed up, his protagonists would swoop in and magically fix. Toxic, agreed.                        </div>

                            I do think that there has been a stigma to the lonely fun. However, I think it has mostly been a self-imposed stigma driven by obsession over offhanded comments, perceived values, and focus on the value of actual play at a table with other people as being not only the primary mode of gaming, but the only mode worth doing. <br/><br/>I mean, I know I've beaten up on myself in the past for doing endless lonely fun when I could be prepping for some cool game. Or when I don't have a game ongoing and I feel like everything I'm doing is silly and a waste of time. (As opposed to the silly waste of time that is playing "kill the dragon" with other people.) But the truth is that there isn't anyone else making me feel like that -- it's my own issues doing it. <br/><br/>Of course, there are some textual issues in our discourse that support my issues being bitchy to me. We have, in this community, occasionally ranted about games in which there is more imagining of the cool play that could actually happen than cool play actually happening, or talked about the ways in which you can pretty quickly tell as a designer who is actually playing your game and who is just reading your game or making characters in endless cycles, or how reading and playing are not the same thing. None of these actually attacks lonely fun (or only do so rarely in extreme cases) -- but all of them do put an emphasis on areas of game other than it as being the valuable parts of game, and for people that already feel their lonely fun is dumb, it may advance their shame complex. <br/><br/>Personally, I got over it a bit ago and now enjoy both group fun and lonely fun. And posting to the forums fun, which is neither game nor lonely fun, but somewhere in the middle.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Of course, there are some textual issues in our discourse that support my issues being bitchy to me. We have, in this community, occasionally ranted about games in which there is more imagining of the cool play that could actually happen than cool play actually happening, or talked about the ways in which you can pretty quickly tell as a designer who is actually playing your game and who is just reading your game or making characters in endless cycles, or how reading and playing are not the same thing. None of these actually attacks lonely fun (or only do so rarely in extreme cases) -- but all of them do put an emphasis on areas of game other than it as being the valuable parts of game, <b>and for people that already feel their lonely fun is dumb, it may advance their shame complex</b>.</blockquote>
Very astute, Brand.  I particularly homed in on that last bit, too. <br/><br/>I gotta admit that I put a huge emphasis on actual playing games over collecting them or just reading them and the like. I'll listen much more to people who are regularly (or irregularly) gaming than people who talk about gaming but haven't played in a long time (a year or more). The end product, the Telos, of a roleplaying game is A Fun Session for Everyone. I don't think that there's a problem with trying stuff out by your lonesome (rolling up characters, etc. Especially being a regular gamer of Game X, but "trying out" a new game Game Y by making Battle-y Characters to understand the system and the like), but doing so for games at the <b>total expense of actually playing</b> ANY game, for a long time (again, dry spells aside, I'm talking a year or more), says to me:<br/><br/>1) This person may be in a foreign country or environment, where they cannot speak the language or find area gamers. Add to this, "In this day and age, they cannot use Skype or Chat or whatever for some reason", or<br/><br/>2) They're doing something wrong.<br/><br/>That aside, if there's a stigma against doing lonely fun/pseudo-gaming in the context of "I game regularly (or irregularly, but still every once in a while) and I do pseudo-gaming stuff", then it must be destroyed.  Because there's some cool pseudo-gaming toys out there today that are immensely fun to play with (the cited BE World Burner, frex; if not just experimenting with rules or characters to better understand a system).<br/><br/>But yeah, I can see how since we always rant, "What are you playing now? How about this month? What about this week? Next week? Tell me about your latest session!" etc, that folks who already have guilt about not playing might be driven to further guilt. I'd like to tell those people first and foremost to get out there and try to get a game together instead of feeling guilty (even online!), and barring that... uh... "Stop feeling guilty!".  But for some people it's hard to break some walls of guilt or shame they built up.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Exactly.  I wouldn't say I feel stigmatized, or self-stigmatized.  Just that I wish it were a more productive use of my time.  Which is why I wish there was like "Story LEGO's", or tiles, or something like that.  Story-Games Solitaire!                        </div>

                            Andy, <br/><br/>General agreement all around. The other thing I'd add is that for some people the lonely fun may become the whole game because they don't actually want to game anymore. They may think they do, they may say they do, but for them the hobby may actually have shifted under them and become the lonely fun hobby. <br/><br/>And personally, I don't have any problem with that in as much as we're able to recognize that there are different things going on. Its when one group talks at another as though they are doing the same thing that problems start. (I saw this a lot with the Tribe 8 mailing lists back in the day, where people playing and people reading and people lonely funning had different needs but no ability to verbalize them or even understand that they were different.)                        </div>

                            I'm probably mixing things up here. But I see some Pseudo Play activities (like drawing characters) as building investment. And possibly an element of immersion. I've seen a few people create their own lifepaths in Burning Wheel or multiple characters as a way to immerse one self in the potential fictional environment. Of course this can be unhealthy when intended for group actual play as you may be immersed in something completely separate from everyone else. <br/><br/>I've also seen a few story games (usually people running them more so than the specific rules) almost treat non conflict role play as Pseudo Play as well. I've seen battle cries to get to the heart of the conflict asap. Start in the action. Jump to the next scene and cut to the conflict. <br/><br/>Is any of this related?<br/><br/>Edit: I've also felt a vibe of tension between general escapism vs. full on emotional engagement. Maybe it's related to Sim vs. Nar/Gam? I'm sure I'm completely messing things up now! Hahahahaha.                        </div>

                            ...which is, I think, the 'stigma' of Lonely Fun (which I prefer to Pseudo-Play).  Lonely Fun can kill Actual Play; I struggle to think of an example where Actual Play kills Lonely Fun -- except in the stretched sense of "I'm getting too much Actual Play to have time for Lonely Fun."  I think nearly everyone has played in a game that had been killed by Lonely Fun, just as everyone has played in a game where GM Fiat threw a wet blanket on everybody's fun.  GM Fiat has a stigma very similar to Lonely Fun -- it has a reputation for messing things up, but it's not definitionally a fun-killer.                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>It may also have to do with sockets and goals and that stuff. I know that I'm a big psuedo-player around things like making characters, lifepaths, and relationship maps (Dogs Towns or <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/54" rel="nofollow">Mo's R-Web Builder thingy</a> are fun for me, sue if you wanna), but I've never done much in character diaries and lack the ability to draw characters -- because I don't get deep into my character's head as part of my play. OTOH, many character socket players I know do journals, drawings of their character, hunt fashion magazines to find the right clothes to wear to the ball, and so on. <br/><br/>However, I think in the context of this thread "psuedo play" is something that happens outside the game -- not just away from the table, but for a game you aren't even currently playing. Prep for a game you're in, be it GM prep or character emotional investment prep, seems to fall into a related but slightly different category.                        </div>

                            I wasn't clear.  Lonely Fun can kill Actual Play because the assumptions of "how it will work" that get built in Lonely Fun can then trump the actual player involvement of Actual Play -- in other words, railroading.

                            I've also seen Lonely Fun harm (not kill) actual play by a player bringing a new character he now wants to play to the group every couple of sessions.  In which case he wanted to drop the character he had been playing.  Now in some games this wouldn't be an issue but in lots of games this can be annoying to the other players and GM who have become invested in the previous character.  What generally happened is that the other players purposefully never tried to get invested in the one player's characters.  After all, what was the point?  He was going to fiddle with generating characters again in a few weeks and being in a new one.                        </div>

                            Josh is getting close to it there.<br/>
<br/>
Several times on SG recently I've seen arguments about whether certain ideals that seem to exist are correct. The problem is that the ideals are being fabricated from logical errors.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly it comes from taking Forge design ideals, or other such principles, and trying to decipher some play ideal from the design ideal or otherwise incorrectly creating conclusions. In this case we see people talking about solo play and such, and they say, essentially, "Forge design ideal says that we have to make games that are good for something other than pseudo-play, so they must be saying that pseudo-play is bad!"<br/>
<br/>
See the error there? Forge theory simply points out that certain sorts of designs make for games that are historically better for pseudo-play than for actual play. What's bad about this, for the designer, is that the game can't spread by word of mouth, since nobody actually plays with other folks. So the argument actually goes, if you want to make lots of sales, make a game that people will actually play.<br/>
<br/>
Which doesn't say anything about the value of pseudo-play to the pseudo-player.<br/>
<br/>
Which does make Dave seem quite a lot like he's projecting here - but we'll assume it's all a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
The other one that I saw recently (it was Josh, in fact) is that people were thinking that Forge theory said something like "People should always do other things than play RPGs with people who they play RPGs with." What it actually says is that for games where you would not do other things with the people with whom you play, they tend to be bad games."<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I guess what I'm saying is to be sure that there's something to rail against before you start railing. Otherwise you're going to look like you're projecting. :-)<br/>

I guess I feel like I see the misconception you're talking about has already 'grown roots' in this community, and you're saying it's my own shame about the activity that I'm imagining condescenscion towards.

Huh.... I uh... wouldn't call my original post a 'rail' at all. But maybe it reads stronger to you than to me.                        </br></br></div>

                            Also, it isn't only those of us who feel guilty about our own psuedo-play who make the "logic errors" that Mike points out. I have seen posts, occasionally at least, in which psuedo-play is referred to as masturbation or other similarly complimentary terms. <br><br>It isn't all the time, and it isn't always as ill-intentioned as it sounds, but it does happen. Not everything is inference and personal demons. Much as we'd like to think our communities are perfect, we do occasionally get the call of Bad Wrong Fun, even here among the people of Story Games who are so very nice.                        </br></br></div>

                            I think calling something "pseudo- anything is going to be somewhat pejorative. It reminds me about how many people got upset over comments about "incoherent" play.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it may be becasue I've been reading a lot of threads about MMOs recently, but I think some of the things I'm reading here about Lonely Fun seems particularly suited to MMOs. Because with an MMO, I can step from Solo to Group play and back again without ruining anyone else's day. I can roll up as many characters as the server will let me, and switch between them as the mood takes me. Is this relevant?                        </div>

                            Doug, <br><br>It may be relevant to another reason why MMORPGs are kicking ass. In a normal trad RPG if you want to switch characters 9 times per session to make your new build have a drive, it can cause problems. (As Andrew pointed out.) But on an MMORPG, it works more smoothly. You can play long term, short term, and lonely fun all at the same time.                        </br></br></div>

                            I've taken to thinking of this as "solitaire play" since running into those damn hippie Forge ideas. There's a fine tradition of this:
<ul>
<li>Doing fantasy world building for your <i>D&amp;D</i> campaign -- making up history &amp; cultures, cartography, writing stories</li>
<li>Generating <i>Traveller</i> star systems, trade systems, etc. Even the chargen lets you tell a little story by yourself, with a protagonist who can die!</li>
<li>Gear-heading up a bunch of vehicles/characters for math-heavy point-buy systems like <i>GURPS</i> or <i>Champions</i></li>
</ul>
This is totally cool. If lonely fun is fun for you, rock on and don't let anyone piss on your (one-man) parade! But, it's really a different activity altogether from social table-top play, isn't it? Confusion arises, perhaps because historically you buy the same books and other merch to facilitate both hobbies. Appealing to both activities as though they are the same hobby is a sensible sales strategy. <i>Hey! If you buy these paints/minis/dice/charts/software tools, you get a fun craft you can enjoy by yourself -- AND you can use it as a stepping stone for a game you can play with your friends!</i><br><br>And that "AND" part can cause trouble. Sure, you <i>can</i> bring elements you've worked up into your solo games, to the same extent that you can bring elements from whatever cool book or comic or movie -- whatever tickles your imagination -- into the game. Stigma shows up when you expect from participants of the social hobby that your investment in the solitaire hobby must count for something in your social game, even if it's getting in the way of the other participants' fun.<br/><br/>I mean, nobody writes fanfic with a real expectation the producers of their favorite show will incorporate it into future series. They write fanfic because they enjoy writing fanfic, maybe sharing it with other fans on its own merits.<br/><br/>All this "Forge game design" stuff concerns itself with the matter of the social activity, with the understanding the solitaire activity is Some Other Thing Entirely. Because there's way too much <i>Hey, why's my social game less fun than I was led to expect?</i> going around in this hobby and not enough products on the market meeting the needs of <i>these</i> gamers.<br/><br/>I leave it as an exercise for the reader as to why certain people with a lot at stake in catering to consumers of the solitaire hobby might become resentful towards the proponents of a design philosophy supporting the notion that the two aspects can be separated.<br/><br/><br/>I kinda don't like "pseudo-play" as a term at all, because it implies a notion that solo play is a wrongbadfun attempt to emulate "real" social play. Rather, solo play should be understood as real and legitimate solo play. If you're going around calling it pseudo-play, well <i>of course</i> it's going to sound shameful!                        </br></br></div>

YMMV, but solo play, at least in my corner of the world, refers to play in a solo (one on one) game.<br/><br/>Now your "solitaire play" up higher makes it crystal clear to me.                        </div>

                            "Lonely fun" is a funny term; sort of nailing it, sort of missing it by miles. There's an underlying notion that it's somehow just personal, for-your-eyes-only-fun, that cannot be shared - and in some way less than shared, for-everyone group-hug fun.<br/><br/>I'd think that, like mentioned, a lot of MMO play, LARP play and character immersive play in general could be described as "lonely fun". I'm just not getting where the term "pseudo" enters all this.                        </div>

                            Jukka, <br/><br/>What part of LARP play is lonely fun? Do significant parts of your LARP happen when not in game and not with anyone else? <br/><br/>Immersion play may happen mostly in your own space, but it also usually happens as part of a game being shared with others, so I don't think its the same thing as what we're talking about here.<br/><br/>(Except maybe on the "conflictless play as psuedo play" tangent -- but no one yet has stepped up to defend that argument.)                        </div>

                            Dang, I meant just that tangent. But let's see what we can work out from this one.

Actually, a good amount of it does - more so for the writer/organiser, moderately so for the player. Depending, of course, on how instant-prep the LARP is.<br/><br/>A writer/organiser can work for months on aspects of game play, background material, character writing/relationships/the whole of it.<br/><br/>The player may need to read through a lot of material, internalize the character (or make one), develope the character (in the sense of this is how he speaks/acts/thinks/looks like) and, depending on the LARP, work with a costume.<br/><br/>The MMO (arguably, depending on how we define not being with anyone else) and character immersive play go to the tangent.                        </div>

                            Jukka, <br/><br/>Hmm. Good points. Of course, this brings up the connection between "lonely fun" and "prep." I think, in the context of the original thread that started this all the lonely fun was stuff that wasn't being done for a game. Maybe it'd be used in a game someday, but not now, and isn't for any game you're currently running or getting immediately ready to run. <br/><br/>However, since then a lot of people have put in the qualification of "I'll use it all someday!" Which means that it becomes more like far, far in advance prep. <br/><br/>Mo also noted that its funny that a lot of us are coming out of the closet as lonely funners in this and the other threads -- and yet as a community we've often been much in favor of low to zero prep games. Which seems to mean that there are some of us who might love to make characters endlessly, but don't want to have to prep for a GM task game. Or don't want to coordinate other people doing so. <br/><br/>Certainly something to consider.                        </div>

Humm... If we want to separate preparation and "lonely fun", if just for the heck of it, two sides of the same coin come into mind; first, the "post-game high" quite often found in LARPs, meaning that there's a strong drive to write down and/or fictionalize the playing experiences after the play by writing a debrief or a report (which, then, is sometimes used as a preparation for the next game in campaign-play). The second is the "post-game low"-syndrome that happens after the possibly highly emotional/adrenaline-rich play, in which you re-live the moments of play while slowly remove yourself from the character.<br/><br/>As for advanced prep, I've experienced it usually stop when it comes to the "lonely fun"-phase; you develope the basic framework for a LARP with other organisers for days, and brainstorm your brains out, but when the inspiration phase is over and perspiration phase - the actual, lonely work of writing - begins, things just collapse.                        </div>

                            Certainly, back when I was LARPing I can recall afternoons <i>entirely</i> devoted to combing through second-hand stores in search of funky jackets and the like.  It was fun.  There wasn't anyone else with me.  I think it qualifies.                        </div>

                            Maybe "para-play" would be a better term all around, actually. <br/><br/>I'm thinking of gardening as a hobby; in temperate climates, being a gardener involves a phase of Actual Gardening in the sense of buying plants and sticking them in the ground and watering and stuff; and then there's the Lonely Fun of looking at gardening magazines and seed catalogs (I just got my Cook's Garden catalog, and that's always good for a few hours of absorption and marginal notes) and looking at the bare frozen yard and dreaming about the new year.  <br/><br/>Both are core activities of gardening, as far as I can tell, in the sense that I've never met a gardener that doesn't do both.                        </div>
