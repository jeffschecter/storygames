But there's a catch, or, at least, some context.<br/><br/>You're in a world the Dark Lord has almost entirely conquered (though the village you've grown up in has escaped being ground under the heel of his boot... for now). At some point you'll have to leave that village and gather what meager courage and skills you have, heading out into the world and taking on new roles in an attempt to battle (and maybe even destroy!) the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>It's an adaptable setting, but will be serious in tone (Tolkien as opposed to Brooks) and low magic (there will be wizards, but no +1 swords). So, considering all that, what kind of character would you like to play in that world? (Think in terms of careers in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Lifepaths in Burning Wheel or even playbooks in Apocalypse World. Your choice of classes is fluid and will change, probably a few times.) What do you think would make for an interesting villager? What would be cool for them to be doing at the midpoint of their quest? How about when they're staring down the Dark Lord in his throne room?<br/><br/>There's no right or wrong answers here--I'd just like to get a sense of people's opinions on the matter.

I could totally imagine one parkouring through a stronghold, causing problems for the Dark Lord and helping people (even just a little bit), rather like Leto in Banlieu 13. Being unarmed, or just wielding farming tools helps escape the notice of the Dark Lord's troops when you're just passing through. You look like anyone else who's oppressed and not allowed to have weapons. Parkour also comes in handy for a post apocalypse situation, running out to get resources and bringing them back to a few survivors, but doing it quickly so you don't get killed, and so they can't track you down to your home base. Being able to move quickly and be self sufficient would be very, very handy in that type of world.<br/><br/>Another choice would be an Archer, Robin Hood and his Merry Men style. Hiding out in forests, taking out the Dark Lord's tax collectors and troops by ambush, never confronting them directly. This of course assumes the Dark Lord wouldn't just have the forest burned down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325215/#Comment_325215" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T17:48:01+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  5:48PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>Falconer.</blockquote>\nthat sounds amazing. could you expand on it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_325219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325219/#Comment_325219" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T18:02:05+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  6:02PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll make my class in three parts then:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>What do you think would make for an interesting villager? </blockquote>A <i>light-weaver</i>; making beautiful magic mirages, and entertaining his peers with that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>What would be cool for them to be doing at the midpoint of their quest? </blockquote>Seeing that the beauty of magic can be used for evil, the light-weaver has turned to the dark arts, and become a <i>shadow-weaver</i> as well, turning his talents to the arts of disguise, concealment and confusion.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: theg33k</cite>How about when they're staring down the Dark Lord in his throne room?</blockquote>Oh, when the Dark Lord at last is met, to have his reckoning, the hero tries everything, and is repulsed with scorn.

A falconer is more modest though and being really good at whatever it is you do doesn't break my suspension of disbelief even when a teen does it. I imagine a youth with a really well trained bird of prey (and the skills to train a new one if the first one dies tragically) and some basic outdoor/adventuring skills. You can either play up the nobility master/servant angle or the woodsman good with animals angle from the beginning and later either play it up even more becoming some sort of beastmaster/druid/wereperson weirdo or transition into some other archetype but keep your kickass falcon as a token of your humble past or perhaps as a familiar that was with you even before you learned magic.<br/><br/>Cool stuff that you can do or that could happen to you:<br/><br/>- It can scout for enemies or the hidden monastery. Much cooler if it's semi plausible too with established signals and training, not some silly stuff like it can talk or you just know what it sees. If it eats one of your eyes you'll see what it sees but that's for later if you get messed up.<br/>- Have your bird steal something right from under someones nose, maybe when a lieutenant of the dark lord is gloating and showing off the Chaos Ruby or whatever.<br/>- Your bird is shot by an enemy. Heartbreaking scene, turn to some other path or seek vengeance or shrug and show everyone what an asshole you are.<br/>- Intercept homing pigeons or act as a courier.<br/>- A massive battle, you are swallowed by the melee. Your friends know you are safe because the bird is circling your proximate position.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325230/#Comment_325230" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T18:40:43+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  6:40PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The parishioner who wants to become a priest.<br/>The thief who's half running away from the Dark Lord, half running towards him.<br/>The farmboy with his father's sword who gets killed fairly early on.<br/>The town drunk who doesn't want to sober up, but has to.<br/><br/>Paksenarrion also sounds perfect for this world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325231/#Comment_325231" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T18:41:22+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  6:41PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2011 6:43PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sin Eater.

And I don't think they're wrong. If I'm modifying a generic fantasy setting, I think including all of the key tropes is important. People may want to exclude them when they play (which is entirely their prerogative), but I think they need to be given the option. The challenge for me will be taking the things that people think of as conventional for halflings and turning them on their ear. They'd undoubtedly make good tunnel rats. And their love of cooking, spices and herbology has probably turned them into expert poisoners.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325360/#Comment_325360" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-19T12:03:12+00:00" title="May 19, 2011 12:03PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lantern314</cite>migo mentioned Midnight earlier</blockquote>\nThat was actually theg33k.
