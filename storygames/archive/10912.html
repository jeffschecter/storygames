If you would like you can comment on that post or feel free to leave comments about the game here. I am mostly reposting here because some of my players mentioned they read these forums.   <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?p=85728#post85728" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?p=85728#post85728</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joey" title="Joey"><img alt="Joey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joey">Joey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242400/#Comment_242400" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T11:08:36+00:00" title="November 17, 2009 11:08AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Josh.  You were right, I do read this forum.  The game was an absolute hoot, man.<br/><br/>Just to throw in my 2 cents, Josh did a STELLAR job of writing beliefs and instincts for each character.  One character (John Turner) had an instinct "Always throw out any unattended alcohol" or something like that.  Put him on a ship with Jack Sparrow and watch the sparks fly!<br/><br/>Using pre-gen characters with entangled Beliefs and Instincts like that turned out to be an excellent recipe for a good con game.  I never considered it before, but any game like BW, with clearly stated character motives, can be sauced that way.<br/><br/>Great game, Josh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242595/#Comment_242595" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T11:58:41+00:00" title="November 18, 2009 11:58AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Joey!  I had a blast running you guys through it. The skills and traits need some serious work but I was quite happy with the beliefs and instincts and how they drove the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
