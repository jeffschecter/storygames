They do this with shape, mostly, with color secondarily. That's because a) the color will appear to be a different color depending on what's near it, b) it will often appear in black and white because that's how it's been printed, and c) only the center of your eye sees color, so if you want it to grab eyes, you have to shoot for the non-fovea parts.</p>\n<p>2: They become recognizable. The best logos activate the structures in your brain that recognize faces. AT&amp;T, Pepsi, the Hammer and Sickle, Go Play, they're all roughly face-shaped and use asymmetry to become more than just a shape.</p>\n<p>3: They should evoke, but needn't state directly, what the product is. Logos generate a feeling; they aren't ads in and of themselves. They're to be <em>associated</em> with whatever ad you use. It's like a comic; here's a guy's face (the logo). Here's what the guy's saying (the content).</p>\n<p>And here's an important thing about graphic design: "I like it" is <em>not a reason</em> to do something. Liking a design is tangential to the power it has. If it's powerful, people will recognize it and like it because of what they associate it with. If they like the logo but it's not powerful, it won't do anything. Just like a guy with a weak chin is less likely to be taken seriously than a guy with a strong chin, the qualities of the product's face has a lot to say about how the content will be accepted.</p>\n<p>And, finally, here's one of the most important lessons I've learned as a graphic designer: never get everyone's opinion. That will lead to the <em>least offensive</em> logo, and that doesn't matter. If we made the Games on Demand logo an exploding baby, everyone would object and no one would ever forget it. Since you want to alienate fewer people than that would, I don't recommend it, but asking everyone for their opinion will lead you away from the ideas where you're stretching, and those are the ones that will work. "I don't like it" is often code for "I noticed it", and "I like it" is often code for "It doesn't offend me."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60786/#Comment_60786" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T08:11:00+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  8:11AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the black bar above DEMAND nearly but not quite touching the word, you're creating tension in the logo, which you really don't want because you're trying to promote GoD as fun, not as something that causes anxiety.  Plus, when printing this on a variety of items -- possible t-shirts, banners, fliers, and the like -- the very thin green line between DEMAND and the black bar may be lost on some of the signage and present on othere.<br/><br/>I'd either let the black of the DEMAND overlap or bleed into the black bar or increase the spacing between DEMAND and the back bar.    I'm assuming that the main usage of this logo will be on a banner in a crowded room to get people to come to your location.  In that case, you'll want readability to be a factor.  That post where you used three logos?  Shrink your text down to the DEMAND on that one, leaving plenty of green space around top and bottom, making certain to leave enough space on the top to make the word stand out.    However, don't use the font in the third logo.  It will be illegible across the room.<br/><br/>The GAMES floating in white has that stand out -- I'd divorce that from the black bar as well.  The main thing you're selling is GAMES.  ON DEMAND is a qualifier, so visually have them separated. In the post with three logos, the first logo has GAMES equal to DEMAND.  When catching the eye of your customer, you want to promote GAMES primarily.  In the third one, the word that will be most visible across the room is ON.  This doesn't inform anyone.  The second one needs some minor tweaks.  Even though the font may be seen as boring, the purpose of your signage is for people to find your location, not to attract people to a brand.  Keep the boring, legible font.  I'll work up a revision based on your original in a sec.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60788/#Comment_60788" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T08:23:38+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  8:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2007 8:25AM by Thomas D.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/godlogo.gif"/><br/><br/>What I've done here is a fast modification of your initial design, as you can tell by the rough drop shadows for GAMES. Unfortunately, I don't have the font used for that word, so when I moved the word up from the black line, the lower part of the text was cut off. <br/><br/>The thing that really bothered me is your logo for GAMES would be unreadable from across the room.  Manually coloring in the drop shadow to solid black from the green you've chosen helps that stand out and calls shifts attention to GAMES.<br/><br/>If you go with a logo like this, remember that if you want to shift to a darker green color, you'll start to make the GAMES into a blur.  If you do that, remove the drop shadow from GAMES.  You'll also want to but a white stroke around DEMAND to let it pop out a bit.  Black on dark colors is too hard to read, almost as bad as red text on black.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60792/#Comment_60792" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T08:38:27+00:00" title="March 13, 2007  8:38AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other thing you'll want to consider are colors.  Are you choosing green because it's the color of Go Play?  If you are, you've got the wrong green.  The Go Play green that was created by the SG folks is right around CMYK 83/19/100/5, yours is 55/0/100/0.  Go Play green is a darker green and you'd want to trap around the DEMAND if you go with that green, black, and white for your logo.<br/><br/>This banner will be for a game room in GenCon, correct?  Do you have any images of the room from last year?  If there were other logos and banners and whatnot around the room, look at their color combinations and try to pick something that will stand out from the others.  If this will go on a wall, look at the wall coloration.  On a booth, look for the booth drapery colors.  <br/><br/>Here's a quick look at color psychology:  <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://psychology.about.com/od/sensationandperception/a/colorpsych.htm</a>  Check out the color links in the table on that page.

You'll be providing a one-color logo (that's a black and white logo) to be printed in the GenCon book, so you'll want a logo reads well with and without color.  Back to Kat's three logo post, that first one in the program book will have GAMES rendered in outline and shrunk down to an unreadable size.  All that you'll probably see in the book is ON DEMAND, and that informs no one.  Drop shadows like the one on my revision will help a bit, but you're still looking at a lot of white space and a thin line when the image is shrunk to about one inch across and printed in one color on newsprint.  Because you have a printing solution that is that small, I would strongly recommend that you not use drop shadows on GAMES.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60865/#Comment_60865" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-13T12:30:52+00:00" title="March 13, 2007 12:30PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was no signage at all in the room we were in last year (other than the table placards with only numbers on them).

These are tired and overused fonts. (COMICS and MYRIAD). The one in the middle looks like Lemeisz. But I could be wrong. That's three fonts for what should be a ONE FONT logo.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo. There is no contrast going on here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThree. GREEN is not a gamey color.<br/>\n<br/>\nFour. You have three or four elements going on in the logo. Focus your ideas. If you're going to have a BLACK line in the middle, but another green box over it (behind GAMES). That should tie your elements together a little tighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nFive. Find one visual CUE that means GAMES ON DEMAND. Even if it's just a hand clicking a mouse. I assume that G.O.D. is a POD or PDF resourse?<br/>\n<br/>\nSix. The one with the heavy black drop shadow is stronger than any, but this isn't an A-list logo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeven. Take feedback of this nature with a grain of salt. Despite my experience as an AD, I still have BIASES against certain design philosophies, no matter how "correct" some schools of thought believe them to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nEight. I do think it's clever that GAMES is ON TOP of DEMAND.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61990/#Comment_61990" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-23T14:40:07+00:00" title="March 23, 2007  2:40PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2007 2:40PM by Adam_Dray.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With my amateur graphic arts skills, I offer this.

Considering using slightly different hand-written fonts for the various signs.
