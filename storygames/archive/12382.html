David Drake. In 'Auntie Maim' the players portray three British schoolgirls, the Larsen triplets, who's parents have been eaten by a tiger while doing missionary work and have been sent to live with their distant relative, the Duchess and former star of stage and screen Mildred \u201cMame\u201d Talmage, a woman who's outward charm masks a a cold malevolence and a sinister plot against the triplets. The game has a mock Gothic tone, like something the Bronte sisters would come up with after polishing off a bottle of sherry and getting all giggly.  <br/><br/>In designing this game, I had three basic goals. First the characters should come to the slow realization of the truth of their situation even as the players have a clear idea of what is going to happen from the outset, creating dramatic tension. Second,  subtle demoralization and petty cruelty should be a major element in the fiction. Third, the game should be, despite all of this, not horribly dark in tone.  Also, given that all things being equal I prefer higher immersion actor stance play to other kinds of play, the game should support that. <br/><br/>The rule set supports these goals mostly through the interaction between the experience system and the task resolution system. In AM, the players can get experience through being the victim of, or witnessing, the Aunts horrible doings, or by finding clues. Players use experience as dice in <i>learning rolls</i> to raise their awareness, a measure of how well the characters understand their situation. The higher the characters awareness, the more mechanically effective the characters become, and the more able the characters are to transgress the 'nice girl' social strictures given them.<br/><br/> However, those learning rolls can be interfered with by the imposition of conditions-the games system for modeling physical and psychological damage, as well as dangerous situations like being trapped or tricked into believing lies. Also, experience gained by a successful attempt by the attacker to emotionally manipulate  the player cannot be used  until the condition is removed. All of this is done using a task resolution system which uses a short number of broadly applicable \u201cMoves\u201d AW style, to determine the stakes of the conflict clearly, while  focusing play on the shared imagined space. <br/><br/><b>What Happened</b><br/><br/>\tThe three Larsen triplets, Larisa, Lulu and Lakshmi are driven to the crumbling manor house of their aunt, who greets them with an effusive warmness and then sends them to to their room to prepare for dinner. The room is cramped, dark, and damp. The triplets investigate the house and find an out of tune piano, which they, being clever children, tune and begin to play. This raises the ire of the Aunt, who lashes out verbally at Lulu. The aunt uses an \u201cimpose condition\u201d move and  succeeds in imposing the 'Cowed' condition on Lulu, which weakens her. Later, the triplets go to the library and discover a mysterious book with pictures of demons in it, this creates a conflict to \u201ccontrol a resource\u201d which they fail, and thus do not understand the book.  They go to the study and find a locked drawer in the desk, but before they can open it (another failed attempt to control a resource) , the house keeper finds them and drags Larisa Larsen to the drawing room, where she is left alone with the Aunt.<br/><br/>\tHowever, instead of punishing Larisa, she chooses to gloss over the incident and give her a makeover. This is another conflict, and Larisa ends up with the \u201cdeluded\u201d condition, and believes that Auntie Mame is a swell person.  Then, at dinner, Mame subtly starts a fight between Larisa and Lakshmi and they both take the \u201cdecieved\u201d condition, which compels them to fight until it's removed.<br/><br/>\tLater that night, however, Lulu manages to suceed in a learning roll and realizes that something is not right with the Aunt. She then uses \u201cremove condition\u201d rolls to convince her sisters that they shouldn't be fighting and that the Aunt is behind it all. Once this happens, the other two twins succeed in their own knowledge rolls. After this, they decide to head to the kitchen to eat something less disgusting than haggis. There, they meet the maid, who they try to convince to join them using a \u201ccontrol resource\u201d roll, which doesn't succeed. Later, Lakshmi  finds the book of demons and sneaks it back to the bedroom, while Lulu explores the cellar. This, as it turns out, is not such a good idea. <br/><br/>While in the cellar, Lulu  finds a locked door, which she picks using a hairpin (hey! It works for Velma on scooby doo!) and finds a secret torture chamber/ room of eldrich badness. Then, she's found by the Aunt and her creepy assistant, Nigel. Lulu tries to escape, but Mame uses her evil witch powers (and a successful roll to impose the \u201ctrapped\u201d condition)  to freeze her feet and drags her back to the secret room. <br/><br/>The next morning, the others find Lulu missing and go searching for her. When they run into the Aunt, however, she successfully (via another \u201cdeceived\u201d condition) to wait for the police to handle it and go up to their rooms. In the dungeon, Lulu uses her chains to create a holy racket (again, using the \u201ccontrol resource\u201d move) Then, Lakshmi finally (though a successful \u201ccontrol resource\u201d roll) deciphers the book, and discovers that it's a book of evil witchcraft. Then, after a successful learning roll, the maid comes up and, with the help of the book, Lakshmi convinces her to help them look for clues around the mansion. Meanwhile, Lulu is threatened and beaten by the Aunt in her dungeon,  and we discover the aunts secret plan to kill the children as part of some magic ritual to make her young again. The other two girls and the maid finally open the locked drawer in the study, finding a revolver and divorce papers implying that the Aunt murdered her husband. Using the papers, the other two girls make learning rolls, remove their \u201cdeceived\u201d condition,  and head to the basement. <br/><br/>In the basement, they find the locked room, shoot the lock off, and find their sister. Freeing their sister, they discover the true danger they are in (making successful knowledge rolls, bringing them up to the highest level of awareness, 'vengeance!). Then, the Aunt and her assistant barge in. Using a mix of insults (giving the aunt the 'Furious' condition) and threats (giving her the 'panicked' condition) they put her off guard. When the Aunt finally attacks, the three triplets work together to simultaneously catch her on fire,  sever her link to her satanic master,  and beat her to death with a field hokey stick. Her assistant whimpers in the corner as the scene ends.<br/><br/>On the whole, I'm fairly happy about how the game turned out. I think that the combined techniques of conditions and moves might be applicable to a wide range of games, not just this one. I think that the experience system succeeds at what it's designed to do. I'd love to hear feedback from my other players.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278131/#Comment_278131" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T09:02:49+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  9:02AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things come to mind, I think:<br/><br/>First, Auntie Maim seemed really, really strong at the beginning, when it was all social challenges, and really weak at the end. We built up a few Conditions on her, but it also seemed like you were rolling really small dice during the fight. Of course, the real struggle should be getting enough XP and Awareness so that you can go medieval on her, and after that it should be a party, but making her a bit stronger in the finish would put more importance on Conditions. And working together<br/><br/>Second, you need more hooks at the beginning. There was a bit too much "what do you do? where do you go?" when all we had to go on was the map of the house. Just some little things, creepiness in the house etc, for us to wonder about. The painting whose eyes follow you, the strange stench, the odd sounds, the stuffed indian in the room where they hear a faint "help me" or some such. Throw out a few of those to give the house/rooms character so it's not a choice between "conservatory" and "library."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278222/#Comment_278222" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T20:21:15+00:00" title="June 27, 2010  8:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for replying!<br/><br/>1) First, you're exactly right regarding the relative importance of XP gain vs the boss fight (which totally should be a party.) But, especially with regards to the two rolls imposing conditions on the Aunt, I rolled weaker dice than I probably should have (I used d6s, and all she would have had to do is yell back for d8s). Also in the original design the aunt had Will, which could be used to give an automatic bonus die, which I didn't use at the beginning and then forgot to use at the end. If the players can get to that final point, the Aunt should be cake, but not the lighter than air angel food cake I was serving up. <br/><br/>2) More hooks. Totally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278232/#Comment_278232" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T02:16:02+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  2:16AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, this might sound like a naive question... you said you didn't want the game tone to get too dark, but some things in there are pretty heavy (torture chambers, demons, bathory-like rituals, etc)... what did  you and the other players do make the game "lighter"? i'm  not really knowledgeable about a Series of Unfortunate Events, but i kind of expect it to have (at least slightly) a lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek tone... what was the resulting mood at the table?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278278/#Comment_278278" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T09:13:10+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  9:13AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the first Series of Unfortunate events book, an infant is put in a bird cage and hung out the window, and a fourteen year old girl is almost married off to her evil Uncle (for the inheritance money, they say, but presumably not just that. Ew.). In later books, people are poisoned, drowned, sent to work in lumber mills, threatened with unnecessary surgery, poisoned (again!) and fed to lions. And yet, while the events in the book are pretty distasteful, the mock Gothic, melodramatic way (the narrator is always saying 'Oh! put this book down! Nobody should read it! It's horrible!') it is presented makes fun, rather than a serious depiction of children in danger at the hands of awful adults. Most Gothic novels work the same way, Jane Eyre has a crazy lady in the attic, Rebbecca has that spooky Mrs. Danvers, but these characters are kind of overblown and camp from the beginning. <br/><br/>There was a lot of laughter at the table. I can't quite tell if it was the fact that we were all men pretending to be three 10 year old girls and one creepy old lady, or the fact that it all happened in a crumbling manor house, or that the map used was a reproduction of the Clue board, or that they got fed haggis that tipped people off about the intended tone. Maybe it's just kind of difficult to take seriously threats wrapped in all that old school Gothic cheese packaging. <br/><br/>This is something that has to be done right, though. I really don't want to make a game that works as a child abuse simulator and triggers panic attacks or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
