"Here are all the stats of the people in your town/company/regiment. When one dies, you get another one. When they all die, the campaign is over - you've lost."<br/><br/>There might be a certain prestige, over time, to having your name on that list the most times or the fewest times.<br/><br/>However, randomizing from a list which changes "length" is awkward. It might be easier to print the attribute sets on cards and shuffle them as a deck, or something like that.<br/><br/>If you're curious about "balanced randomness" and various crossovers between old-school D&amp;D and AW/DW (PbtA) rolls and technology, I think you'll find two of my old threads quite interesting. (In particular, one presents a solution to "using attribute scores as they are" and DW-style rolls, as well as homogenizing that with LotFP skill checks.)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19464/d-d-osr-rolling-ability-scores-and-semi-randomness" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/19464/d-d-osr-rolling-ability-scores-and-semi-randomness</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19408/a-rather-odd-confluence-of-d-d-and-apocalypse-world-or-a-die-mechanic-late-night-absurdium" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19408/a-rather-odd-confluence-of-d-d-and-apocalypse-world-or-a-die-mechanic-late-night-absurdium</a><br/><br/>(The LotFP Skills bit is the sixth post from the bottom, FYI, if you're not reading the whole thread.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465142/#Comment_465142" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-30T00:17:00+00:00" title="July 30, 2017 12:17AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You list the same problems/issues that I generally have with the D&amp;D default setup. (I say "generally" because it's somewhat contextual - some of those things are less of issues for some types of play.)<br/><br/>For comparison's sake, my solution to much of this is basically to make attributes less permanent. That solves pretty much every balance issue with the D&amp;D random stat line, because players are no longer stuck with permanent structural penalties in their character builds. And we still get to enjoy the random element in chargen, and we get to have stronger and weaker initial builds; it's just that the stats get to live through play. (Which I would argue is the true process for original D&amp;D anyway; the systemic pressure towards it is too strong, as we see while contemplating the point of having <i>Gauntlets of Ogre Strength</i> at all.) Instead of having to roll a new character to get that good Strength score, or having to find a magic item to fix it, you can just play your current character well enough, and make the choices that help out their Strength over time. Attributes don't need to be fate.<br/><br/>Your solution (balancing the stats) is passably fine, too, but I would frankly miss the bitter-sweetness of having those better and worse stat lines. It's a big part of the enjoyment in the game to have players start with unfair, random advantages and disadvantages. For me the sweet spot lies in getting to have that unfairness, but not elevating it into an unchanging principle that is utterly impossible for characters to address during their career. (AD&amp;D goes utterly bonkers in this regard, one has to admit: improving character stats is one of the most utterly expensive magical undertakings in the entire universe in that game, requiring dozens of Wish spells if you want to create a "perfect specimen".)<br/><br/>Regarding the balanced stat lines, by the way, you don't really need a computer program to create them. A simple hands-on procedure might be more fun for at least some players. This one gives you reasonably random characters with stats that always average to 10.5:<br/><b>1)</b> Roll 9d6, write down the results.<br/><b>2)</b> Next to each result x, write down 7-x, such that the sum of the two numbers always totals to 7. You now have a list of 18 numbers that always total to 63.<br/><b>3)</b> Assign the 18 numbers to stats with a pleasing random or pseudorandom method. For me a quick method to execute would be to start writing the numbers down into stats (three to each stat, going down my numbers list rather than across), except I'd skip down one stat every time I write an odd number so as to spread the array around in pseudorandom way. Wouldn't take long.<br/><br/>Regarding the issue of not getting enough bang out of the actual attribute scores when the modifiers do all the heavy lifting, that's a historical paradox of D&amp;D design. Pretty much the only consistent choices are to go for an ability check mechanism that uses the raw scores (e.g. Mentzer), or throw out the scores after you've derived the modifiers. Those are the two solutions that satisfy me, at least. I've even developed an entirely statless take on the D&amp;D rules framework, precisely because they're such an add-on in the original game [grin].<br/><br/>(Yeah, there's also the 3rd edition solution of reading ability modifiers off different ability score steps than Feat requirements. They sort of justify using Ability scores alongside modifiers. Putting lipstick on a pig, clearly.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465260/#Comment_465260" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-02T06:27:34+00:00" title="August  2, 2017  6:27AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2017 6:33AM by 2097.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the game I play, based on 5e, having one high stat is valuable but having a couple of dump stats is fine. So an 18 10 7 7 7 7 is better than a 14 14 14 14 14 14. You'd put the 10 in Constitution presumably. This isn't a solution, it's a wrinkle on Eero's 10.5 solution.<br/><br/>Also, having the scores average around 12 or 14 (I've gone with 12) has advantages over having them average around 10; because then when you do the 3e/4e/5e-formula [(score-10)/2] to get the mod, you'll get fewer negatives which means you'll have to do less subtraction. The DCs and ACs are adjusted accordingly.<br/><br/>That's why I do "4d6 drop the lowest, arrange in any order" as per AD&amp;D (and 2e, 3e, 4e and 5e). I also offer the standard array 15 14 13 12 10 8. We don't use point buy.<br/><br/>When I'm using my own random generation (for pregens etc), I was using that standard array; putting the highest numbers according to the classes "quick build" suggestion (i.e. 15 in dex for a rogue) and assigning the remaining numbers randomly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465261/#Comment_465261" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-02T06:38:36+00:00" title="August  2, 2017  6:38AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>throw out the scores after you\u2019ve derived the modifiers.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s my preference too, but I leave this to the players and they do like keeping their scores.

Whether there are dump stats that some or all classes can safely ignore, whether the players are even thinking in char-op terms while making choices, whether they <i>can</i> make choices on the abilities...<br/><br/>If one cares strictly about the ability modifiers, it wouldn't be a stupid idea to simply randomize those directly instead of going through the ability score rigamarole. I particularly feel this way if you're not doing 3d6 (preferably in order); the aesthetic value in the 3-18 ability score range lies largely in the statistically transparent bell curve. If player characters are going to have biased scores anyway, and we don't really use the scores for anything, then the intuitive sense of how rare a STR 14 is doesn't really come into anything anymore.<br/><br/>For an example of 3rd ed. style ability modifiers with a more usable chassis, consider this:<br/><b>1)</b> The natural ability range is 1-10. The average/default is 5. Extreme scores are assumed to be rare. Scores of 10+ are possible from superhuman causes, just like normal.<br/><b>2)</b> Roll a stat score with 3d10, pick the middle value. Gives a roughly similar bell curve to the traditional 3d6.<br/><b>3)</b> Make ability checks just as in modern D&amp;D, except you use the score directly instead of a separately calculated modifier. To use 3rd+ edition DCs, add five, because your assumed average is 5 rather than 0. The scores are otherwise similar enough to usual, except now you don't have legacy cruft or subtraction.<br/><br/>The above doesn't work, of course, if the players really care about the superficial elements of the D&amp;D legacy. In that case it's STR 18 or bust, with "/00" optional.<br/><br/>It is interesting how I've found personally that a much simpler solution produces no problems for me, though: apparently I can just take the traditional 3-18 ability score and plug that into a modern D&amp;D ability check mechanic as-is, and that still works just fine. So instead of rolling [ability modifier] + d20 I roll [ability score] + d20, and the game feels if anything more realistic, and characters gain more distinction. You absolutely can't use a min-maxed stat line with this sort of thing, of course; there needs to be a strong bell curve distribution so that very low and high scores are rare. Just like Mentzer, really; the difference between "roll and add" and "roll under" is more aesthetic than mathematical, as we well know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
