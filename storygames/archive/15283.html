They've had a mixed reception, a lot of the people here barking at high post-speed about how wrong the new posters are.<br/><br/>There might be a strong convention of ideas developing here, that makes it very hard for people to enter with different ideas, or different points of view. Some new posters have reacted very strongly to the way we have treated their shared thoughts.<br/><br/>I have reacted myself, to the way a lot of debaters have worked themselves up, insisting on reading me wrong, even when they have been corrected. It is silly, and moot, to discuss any serious issue with people not able to keep a clear head, and not willing to discuss the real meanings of what we present here. Not all have done this, but I've seen reasonable voices go silent in some threads, and suspect that they may have shut up due to others actively misinterpreting my meanings, making them quite difficult to swallow. I hate it when a barking pack of hounds take over a thread.<br/><br/>I know that I have my share of "peculiar" ideas, with my own philosophy and a particular terminology, on role-playing games. Being such a brave knight of my own philosophy, and so open with my experiences, I have come to expect some heated discussions and silly misunderstandings in my threads. What I do not expect, is for me to be blamed with the misunderstandings of others, and to be held responsible for their lack of manners. <br/><br/>To have my ideas called "toxic", on the basis of assumptions made by the poster, as happened in a debate recently, really test my patience. I managed to keep my tongue. But to see that the poster gets away with such language, seemingly with no repercussions, feels wrong for me. It sends a message to other posters, that this kind of language is permitted, and this level of discussion is ok. It is not.<br/><br/>If I were to invent meanings, putting words in the mouth of others, and then go on to be seriously offended by them, shouting my head off, I would surely become a very engaged, and utterly silly, man. Pray I don't do so, ever.<br/><br/>I do believe that this forum, as most others dedicated to open discussions, would be better off welcoming alternate points of view with more open curiosity and constructive criticism. There has been a long tradition of doing exactly that in this forum, and that is one of the reasons I've stayed here so long. I have had much use of the discussions here, and would be sad to leave. But recent discussions seems to indicate that this forum is sliding towards bad practice, leaving me and others in a soggy field of time-consuming nonsense.<br/><br/>So, in earnest, I ask you this; <br/>- is this forum in the process of developing a culture for bad discussion techniques?<br/>- if it is; how can we turn the trend? Start anew? Get over it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347203/#Comment_347203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T02:21:42+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  2:21AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2011 2:22AM by Hans_c-o.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- is this forum in the process of developing a culture for bad discussion techniques?</blockquote>\nTomas, I think the gravity in internet forums in general naturally bends toward bad discussion techniques. We're all game designers and players, right? So lets think about what kind of emergent (or intentionally designed) properties the design of an internet forum engenders.<br/><br/>Maybe not helpful to your point, but I think you're missing the forest for the trees. For what it's worth, I think Vanilla is designed better than most for good discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347206/#Comment_347206" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T03:15:15+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  3:15AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- is this forum in the process of developing a culture for bad discussion techniques?</blockquote>\nAs Hans says, this seems to be a normal part of how discussion cultures develop. Something to do with prisoner's dilemmas and short vs. long term advantages, I'd hazard; individuals gain short term advantages such as satisfaction from inconsiderate and uncivilized behaviors, and pave the way for further deterioration at the same time by showing a bad example to others.\n<blockquote>- if it is; how can we turn the trend? Start anew? Get over it?</blockquote>\nThe only reliable solution I've seen is ethos-based: when a widely consensual ethos is enforced by eternal vigilance, deterioration in social standards cannot proceed. Act the way you wish others to act, don't hesitate to speak against wrongs, that sort of thing. Old-fashioned leadership, in other words: if others respect your ethos and decide to follow it, you can maintain an entire community that way. Force-based authority doesn't really fundamentally help you be a better person, despite the amount of energy people put into fiddling with moderation rules of web communities. In this regard the Story Games moderation is pretty ideal, but maybe the community lacks in shared ethos a bit now and then. This is not surprising, considering how the Story Games community is relatively plural and egalitarian compared to eg. The Forge, one of my favourite web communities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_347209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347209/#Comment_347209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T04:00:44+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  4:00AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2011 4:03AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice comments, Hans and Eero. Thanks! I agree with you; there is little else to do, but to lead by example, and speak up when people act badly. This thread is me trying to speak up. I hope it helps. <br/><br/>I got a response in a thread I partook in, that nicely illuminates what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Chris Edwards is a man I have a great deal of respect for, so pardon me for bringing his recent posts to the table as an example of really bad practice.<br/><br/>He starts off posting this, late in a thread:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C. Edwards</cite>I'm patiently waiting for Moses to post in this thread, since there seems to already be so much zealous declaration of THE TRUTH going on. Points to the first poster to summon a swarm of locusts.</blockquote>I answered: <i>Don't you know enough to contribute in other ways than this, Chris?</i>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C. Edwards</cite>Tomas, I know enough to not insist that I not only know what other people's experiences are but that my experiences have given me access to a definitive truth. Maybe it's not having English as a native language but you and Norbert have been making some incredibly arrogant and off-putting statements.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Also, I only get two troll posts a year and I was despairing of reaching my quota until this thread popped up. One more thing: Your Mom. (quota reached).</blockquote>Others being "arrogant" and "off-putting" in your eyes, is not an excuse for behaving this way. Saying such things, with no quotes and no explanation, leaves your opponents in the fog. That makes it nothing but a smear, and no good at all. It is bad irony and conceited mannerism. You are not really engaging in a fair discussion. Instead you are playing the gallery with your "hurt feelings" and "superior understanding" of how hopeless your opponents are. <br/><br/>I really loathe it when people act this way, and I have had my fill of it in this forum recently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347211/#Comment_347211" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T05:09:43+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  5:09AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's talk about procedures to avoid more roadkill.<br/><br/>There is the ethos police (official or unofficial): speaking out (privately or publicly) when the ethos is violated.

It also leaves various degrees of Internet wrongness unaddressed and free to profilerate if everybody reacts by retreating, leaving those who hold contentious opinions to reinforce each other in their own echo chamber. Of course somebody being wrong in the Internet is nothing to get upset over in the grand scheme of things, but then that's not what we're discussing here - we're discussing the petty scheme of Story Games social atmosphere, which is in the Internet, and can't be improved by belittling it. The overall outcome of widespread shunning in lieu of constructive debate would be a rise of cliques and increasing group-think, one would assume, ultimately ending up with a value-neutral discussion environment instead of a community. This would be a shame, as Internet is pretty much by default full of neutral platforms where everybody does whatever they want and nobody feels communal responsibility to act decently.<br/><br/>Besides, drive-by arguing is considered of very ill form by some cultures, and even constructively intended silence easily ends up seeming like that: you come in, puke your ill-conceited ideas on somebody, and then go away when they don't immediately praise your insight, often even declaring grandiosely how nobody should debate your ideas because you decided to have the last word and go away. Of course there is a difference, but it's sufficiently vague to cause offense. And I do admit that while some people admire patient and orderly debate directed at constructive communication, others will find it untolerably tedious.<br/><br/>I do agree about ethos-policing, though; it's pretty annoying when done like that. I like <i>exemplifying</i> your virtues more than <i>enforcing</i> them, if that makes sense in the context.<br/><br/>Certainly an interesting topic, and challenging one. It's ironic that we're discussing this at Story Games, which has less of a problem with social decorum than many other Internet places. I guess the ones used to luxuries are the most demanding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347216/#Comment_347216" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T08:00:02+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  8:00AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- is this forum in the process of developing a culture for bad discussion techniques?<br/>- if it is; how can we turn the trend? Start anew? Get over it?</blockquote>\nHere are techniques that can help combat a bad discussion before it starts\u2026<br/><br/><b>- Be as clear as possible. </b> What do you want? What don't you want?<br/><br/><b>- Be as transparent as possible. </b> Say your reasons for posting.<br/><br/><b>- Be careful your subject doesn't undermine your intentions. </b> It may seem counterintuitive, but many people react to subjects more than posts. Or a strong subject can cause people to misread posts. This is tricky because a strong provocative subject can cause more people to read a post. But at the same time, provocative can also derail the post itself. Try to be provocative without being personal.<br/><br/><b>- Define loaded terms. </b> If "immersion", "narrativism", "realism", "game", "toy", "freeform", "rules", "gns" and other loaded terms are important to your description, be clear what you mean by these terms. It can be frustrating. Why don't people simply infer my meaning via context? Some will. Many won't. Better to be safe. Tell us what you mean when you use these words. Better yet, avoid these types of words if you can. If you can't, define them.<br/><br/><b>- Guide your thread. </b> If someone takes your thread in a direction that distracts from the point of the thread, politely restate the goal of the thread and politely ask people to start new threads to discuss any tangential conversation. <br/><br/><b>- Be polite. </b> Use neutral language when discussing material that has a high percentage chance or history of being offensive. <br/><br/><b>- Don't assume, ask questions. </b> Don't put words in someone else's mouth. If you aren't sure what someone is saying or why, ask them. <br/><br/><b>- Be brief or summarize. </b> If you post is long, summarize it at the beginning and end. <br/><br/><b>- Read <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4" rel="nofollow">Story Games' rules</a> before posting. </b><br/><br/><b>- Use the rules. </b> If someone is causing problems in your thread after you asked them to stop, contact a moderator to intervene. <br/><br/><b>- Re-read your post before posting. </b> Roleplay it out! Imagine you are a community member reading your post. How will they react? Is there anything that is unclear? Is there anything people may react badly to? What can you rewrite to solve problems before they even start? Re-read. Edit. Then post. <br/><br/><b>- Don't post out of anger. </b> If you are angry, write down your post and save it. But don't post it. Give it a day. Then re-read your post. Are you still angry? If not, re-write it. Then post.<br/><br/><b>- Don't feed the trolls. </b> Some people who cause problems want attention. Don't give them attention. <br/><br/><b>- Most trolls aren't trolls. </b> Most problems are not because someone has a bad intent towards you. It is because there is some sort of misunderstanding. Which is why these techniques are so important. Work to reach mutual understanding.<br/><br/><b>- Update your first post. </b> Was there something in your first post that caused problems in the thread? Go back, edit the first post, and update it so that new people coming to the thread won't repeat the same mistakes. But state that your post has been edited, how it has been edited, and why. <br/><br/><b>- Are you trying to win? Don't post. </b> Forums are for discussions. When you want to start a new thread, you click "start a new discussion." If you don't actually want to have a discussion, don't start a thread. Instead write a blog post, facebook status update, google plus update, or twitter tweet. Here is my rule of thumb. If my goal is to convince you of something without learning anything myself, then it is probably not a great post for discussion. <br/><br/><b>- Assume you are part of the problem first. </b> If multiple people are reacting negatively to something you said, odds are, something you said is causing the reaction. That doesn't mean you are wrong, it doesn't mean you have a bad intent, it doesn't mean you are a bad person, and it doesn't mean no one else is at fault. Fault doesn't matter. Just fixing problems. What can you do differently? <br/><br/><b>- It starts with you. </b> Many of these techniques require that you do extra work. That can seem inefficient. Maybe it is inefficient. But your percentage chance of influencing your own actions is far greater than influencing someone else's actions. Let alone 100 other people's actions. Let alone strangers. Let alone strangers from different cultures with vastly different life experiences who speak different languages. It's more work, but if you focus on what you can do differently rather than what others can do, your chance of success is much higher.<br/><br/><b>- If all else fails, learn from mistakes, and try again. </b> If a thread is beyond saving, step back and ask yourself why. What went wrong? What can you do to stop those problems from happening again? Then try again. Start the same thread but incorporate solutions to prevent the same problems from happening.  <br/><br/><b>- Perception is more important than reality. </b> It doesn't matter what you meant. Only what people think you mean. Which is 90% of the reason for the above techniques. These techniques help align perception with reality.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347225/#Comment_347225" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T09:10:24+00:00" title="October 29, 2011  9:10AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2011 9:17AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John I want to hug you right now.

I doubt that people will ever have the time to read about complex protocols -as right as they might be- but it may be an idea to drop a link to the 'rules' when the atmosphere heats up. A simple rule could be 'take it privately', out of the thread.<br/><br/>I want to explain why I think that leaving a thread that bothers you could be a good idea. I might be 'wrong', so the other guys can continue discussing without me bothering them. And if I am 'right', I take my discussion somewhere else where I can develop it.. it's not like we are fighting for land or attention. There is plenty of both, and you -personally- can decide to which branch give your energy. It doesn't even make sense to prove someone wrong, because by giving him attention... by growing a bad thread you are making him right - in a way.  Here I am assuming that the most 'positive' branches will get more energy, whereas the other ones will dry out.<br/><br/>Saying that, as I see it and without knowing the SG rules, the person that starts a thread should be the host, and as a rule of courtesy, he should have the right to moderate and to say 'no more of this' in his thread, or just declare it close.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347230/#Comment_347230" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-29T10:38:55+00:00" title="October 29, 2011 10:38AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Tomas, when one member of the forum can say that they would in fact be offended by the way you are treating situations pertaining to their own personal culture's genocide, situations that keep his family still in poverty and your response is, "No, really, its fine," you lost the ability to complain about forum culture with any credibility.

Really unpleasant threads develop when people are talking at cross-purposes or plain disagree about something, but can't let it go, even after it becomes obvious that the thread has stopped being productive. When that happens the thread becomes unpleasant not just for the people involved in the argument, but for anyone else who might be thinking of contributing. I think this might be John's "are you trying to win" point, which strikes me as a really important one that lies at the root of most flamewars.<br/><br/>The other side of this is people being dickish from the outset. I think it should be obvious to everyone that you should never be dickish to someone except in jest, they won't know it's in jest unless they know you quite well and (it being the internet) even then maybe not, and even if they do, others may assume you really are being dickish. The standing advice for internet-based writing is, don't say anything if it could be construed as dickish, even if you feel very strongly that it isn't. Posting on the internet is standing on top of a hill with a loudhailer broadcasting to the entire world: someone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> going to misread what you're saying.<br/><br/>Anyway, thanks Tomas for starting the thread.

I'm white, so racism obviously doesn't affect me the way it does a person of color, but it still makes me angry and uncomfortable. And then there's the fact that different forms of prejudice rarely seem to exist independently of one another - the most obvious example being sexism and homophobia, where prejudice against gay men is often wrapped up in their supposed effeminacy - they're "pussies", "girl-boys", like women and so less than men. When I see someone expressing racism, whether it's overt or unaware, I find myself wondering what reason they'd find to be contemptuous of *me*.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347399/#Comment_347399" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T13:36:45+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  1:36PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen examples like the ones you posit above occurring here?

Actually, you *chose to read it that way*, and it fits well enough if you choose to imagine it so. But it was your choice.<br/><br/>"Mere cultural ignorance"? I'm going to try to believe you meant that kindly, although it sounds pretty arrogant at a first reading to me.<br/><br/>As I said in another thread, I don't think any reasonable person could find what Tomas was *actually proposing* offensive. It's like objecting to Dogs in the Vineyard on the grounds that it glorifies Mormons as infallible. That's how deep the misunderstanding runs.

That is my opinion (and in case someone starts going on about the opinions of white liberals again, I CAN link you to at least one essay on the subject written by a PoC, not to mention Nameless' comments in the thread).<br/><br/>Second, it took a long time for Tomas to explain much of anything, and there was a LOT of "you misread me, you misrepresent me, this is fantasy with more ambition than you're used to, I will do this whatever you say, I am being sensitive even if you say I'm not" in between his original statements and that explanation. And the orcs are still going to be evil, and piss on people. I fail to see how I'm "unreasonable" in thinking this displays a lack of sensitivity, and I didn't read the issue as being "worked out amicably".<br/><br/>But maybe that's just me not being willing to bend far enough backwards to put a positive spin on everything other people write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347442/#Comment_347442" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T17:10:37+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  5:10PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Linda, thanks for clarifying what you meant. I'm not sure where you got the quote about "cultural ignorance" from, but it seems to me you shouldn't repeat such things unless you believe them to be true.<br/><br/>If you think that Tomas's "orcs" are evil, you have woefully misunderstood. They are just *people* who the settlers call "orcs", with some customs that seem strange and are easily misinterpreted (he is playing with various ideas, but the details aren't the point). Tomas kept telling you that you didn't understand, but you kept believing that he was arrogant and insensitive, when in fact he was just telling you the bare truth in what is not his native language. He *was* being sensitive, his game *is* ambitious and you still don't get it.<br/><br/>Tomas was never "representing other races by analogy to non-human creatures". I agree, that's a bad idea. He's using the players' notions about "things called orcs" to lead them into doing things they will, with any luck, later realise to be horribly mistaken and based only on their prejudices about "orcs". In doing so, they will discover that the difference between them and their racist, ignorant ancestors is not so great as would be comfortable, and will get an insight into their own psyche. You may think this sounds like a cheap trick, and I agree that it would have to be done right to work as he intends, which is why he says it's ambitious. But it's not the thing you think it is. It's the other side of the mirror.<br/><br/>You can quote essays by PoC or American Indians all you like, but it's just not relevant. This game is not about them, and rightly so, because he appreciates that he doesn't have the right to interpret their experience, even with the best intentions. It's about the experience of being an ignorant, fearful, prejudiced coloniser, of no particular place and no particular time, and done right, it will be just as unsettling and thought-provoking for the players as playing a gun-wielding righteous Defender of the Book of Life is in DitV. <br/><br/>It's not a question of being willing to bend over backwards in this case, just a question of realising that you weren't really listening, because you were too angry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla" title="Sodzilla"><img alt="Sodzilla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla">Sodzilla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347444/#Comment_347444" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T17:21:00+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  5:21PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2011 5:30PM by Sodzilla.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...look, English is not MY native language either.

The way I read it, Tomas wanted to give his players' characters the opportunity to act horribly due to player prejudices, with the players later coming to realize the inhumanity of their behavior. Which by itself is interesting.  He also seemed (to me) to unquestioningly assume it was ok to do so, which I can see how could piss people off. <br/><br/>This is not the thread to discuss it, but I wonder how one could address the same issue in a subtler non offensive way. By issue I mean: making you realize you also are capable of prejudices and inhuman actions while feeling fully justified - without even be aware of having prejudices or doubting to be the good guy. <br/><br/>Kagematsu, for one, seems to address the issue of female oppression in a very clever way by forcing male players to play female characters and a female player t play the Kagematsu character. It's a bit more subtle than that, but if you have read the game you know what I mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347452/#Comment_347452" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-31T18:33:02+00:00" title="October 31, 2011  6:33PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2011 6:33PM by Andy.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't had a chance to comment as moderator/the sociologist note-taker behind the curtain. And unfortunately, due to extreme lack of sleep I'll have to put this off to tomorrow.<br/><br/>But for now, I'll just say:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>Lee, who "had a right" to be offended, took a sane and thoughtful approach despite being clearly upset at what Tomas appeared to be suggesting, and got a pretty good result.</blockquote>\nLee explained - though obviously frustrated and appalled while doing so - out of the kindness of his heart. He did not have an obligation to do so. The results, as good (?) as they were, were hard fought and in the end still extremely questionable in nature. But hey, dialogue was had. Cue the dancing children.<br/><br/>"Offended on his behalf": I'm not Japanese, but I've lived there about a fifth of my life, fluent in the language, married to a national, follow local and national news in Japanese, and have contemplated citizenship. So I feel like I'm, I dunno, learned on the subject or whatever.<br/><br/>If someone came into the thread and started saying things that made all my "This is totally fucking racist against asians/Japanese" head-alarms go off, or a gang of politically militant Korean gamers (!?) came in talking about how Japan is a nation of monkeys who stole their culture in an invasion between 1591 and 1598 and pawned it off as their own, you better well believe that I'm going to be offended on behalf of a race which I am not. <br/><br/>I don't have the same background in education/history on blacks in America or Native Americans, but I know a lot of warning signs when "racial insensitivity/racial ignorance" is present.  Unfortunately, in the hyperbolic internet world, this has been shortened to "racism". Racism's definition (at least still according to dictionary.com) is "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to rule others</i></span>" (Webster's says "<i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race</span></i>"). <br/><br/>I mean, that's clearly not what was happening in that thread, but <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ignorance</span></b> - due to cross-cultural communication issues, due to differences in culture* perhaps even <i>willing ignorance</i> (fingers in ears/"I can't hear you!"/"You're wrong, end of discussion!") - was definitely going down.\n<blockquote><b>Whereas those who were offended on his behalf quit the thread or never posted at all, and apparently are offended still. There's a moral in there somewhere.</b></blockquote>\nThe moral in there? It's common sense. It's <b>empathy</b>, the cornerstone of human interaction (and the single Rule Of Law which forms the core of this forum, to boot). The moral to be found here is that people care about other people, as well they f'ing should.<br/><br/>Sure, I've seen enough of internet shittery to see people use the tools of "claiming offense" and the like to bully, to tear people down, to score points with a private sub-community, etc. Sometimes I'll say wishy-washy stuff to put folks at ease, like "I don't think that something like that happened there." But heck, in this case I'll take it a step further: The Objective Reality Needle is pointing square on "Sorry, didn't fucking happen". <br/><br/>The people claiming offense simply said so and walked away; they didn't bully, kick back, fire salvos, go aggro, etc. They either said "I'm outta here" (or some variant), or "Here's why I don't think this discussion is good (XYZ); I'm leaving". I've seen real and severe misuse of claiming offense as a tool to belittle, bully and hold power over others**, but it wasn't happening here. Folks walked away because they were under no obligation to stick around and explain what's what to someone who was utterly convinced that they were Correct and Infallible. They didn't have the time, effort or will to explain to a person who isn't already a close friend; to become that unstoppable object to try to displace that immovable force.<br/><br/>Wow, and I intended that to be the short version.

With one of my ancestral roots going back to the sami people, which shares a history of oppression with the indians, that would be quite like shooting myself in the leg.<br/><br/>I have said a great deal about <i>orcs</i>, though, and have repeatedly reminded people in the indian-thread that the game I was discussing was all about orcs. I've said <i>"orcs will be described as filthy, dumb, thieving and murderous in my game, and they will be portrayed as strange, peaceful, provocative and agitated, in the same game"</i>. My intention with the indian-thread was to get some inspiration for the cultural clashes in my game, between humans and orcs, not to find a way to portray indians. I got a lot of inspiration. <br/><br/>I got a lot of misunderstood hurt too, and I really expected it. I have touched upon controversial themes before, and have seen that such themes comes with their own dangers. You may put it as gentile you want, but mostly due to people having unresolved issues with such issues, there will be shouting. A lot of people react strongly when confronted with particular themes, due to them having a need to shout out: <b>I am not part of this! I'm no racist! My ancestors did wrong!!!</b><br/><br/>That is one of the reasons most people shirnk away from such issues. It is ok. <br/><br/>If I wanted the portray the indians, and their fate in the clashes with whites, I would do so directly and without shrinking from it. But I do not.

I know it is hard to apologize, but sometimes it is called for, and a good way to move forward. Apologizing is not to loose face, it is to keep fate with your peers.<br/><br/>This goes for saying things are "toxic", when you do not understand what they really are.<br/>This goes for calling people "arrogant", when they call you on your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arguments</span>, those arguments being weak or lacking.<br/>This goes for behaving like a dick, and claiming that other behave in an "off putting" manner, and that that justifies you being a dick.<br/>This goes for going out high in the field when newcomers post alternative points of view on rpgs, calling people names, or belittling them, and in effect doing so they shun this forum, and we loose their insights.<br/><br/>There's been some of this going on lately, and it makes me sad. So; this thread is for you! Here yo have the chance to be a bit more humble about these things, maybe a little contrite about your own behavior, and maybe; to apologize? <br/><br/>I long to get moving in a better direction again.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347493/#Comment_347493" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T06:08:00+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  6:08AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2011 6:08AM by walkerp.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><br/><br/>In other news, people often act in a racist and sexist manner -- like all the time, on a deep and substantial level -- and so people who have made an effort to learn how to recognize that sort of behaviour tend to see it all over the place.

On the contrary, they tend to be generally aware of these issues and quite sensitive to them if not actively involved in working with communities to improve their situation.  You speak as if there is some great divide between those in the know ("people who have made the effort to learn how to recognize...") and those not, as if it requires special training and knowledge to see these things.  Sounds like a recipe for observer bias to me.<br/><br/>Here are my two issues with this position, the first is general and the second is pertinant to the hobby and forum discussion. <br/><br/>First, it's always about language and there is no discussion of action.  My question to the people angry about certain use of language is always "what are you doing to actually improve these things?"  And usually the answer is nothing or "talking about it now".  I have found the loudest people on these issues are usually people in academia or civil servants in relatively comfortable administrative jobs, so in effect doing nothing to make real change in the world.  I don't argue that language isn't related to power, but the emphasis it is given in these cases is overblown.<br/><br/>Second, we are talking about an imaginary space.  This is art.  We get dangerously close to censorship when we attack people for the content of their game.  The closeness to certain liberal values and puritanism is another reason why it is mostly Americans who get offended.  We aren't talking about WotC's hiring policies or the current state of psychological and economic despair in the First Nations communities.  We are talking about a game.  Would you be boycotting an art show with ambiguous images of natives as orcs?  Or a movie?  I think that most liberal Americans would have an easier time saying yes to that question than most Europeans.<br/><br/>I see this same kind of fundamental conservatism when it comes to content in our hobby across the board.  On therpgsite it's disguised as fear for the hobby, here it is disguised as fear for the other.  But to me, it's the same thing: moral outrage of a deeply puritan culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347494/#Comment_347494" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T06:10:53+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  6:10AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas, I have basically ignored most of the other contributors to the orcs thread that has erupted into multiple other threads about civility and race and appropriate behavior and such. Mostly because I think that your intentions are actually good and your ideas are interesting, and addressing all of those voices would confuse what I would like you to hear. I have read charitably and ignored the many ways that your presentation of the subject made it almost impossible to come to any other conclusion than that you were at best being insensitive to my feelings and understanding of my own history, mostly because there could be a cross cultural and second language effect going on here. I really think that you deserve the benefit of the doubt at least.<br/><br/>That being said, I will let you know, I still think that your tactics are rife with privilege, insensitivity, and misunderstanding. I think that for a true understanding of oppression, we always have to come from the perspective of the oppressed, and everyone who has ever been a part of the oppressed will always identify with the oppressed. We are them. That is why rap music is the most popular genre on the reservation, not country music, despite the fact that reservations are rural and people ride horses on the rez more than BMWs or Escalades. Native kids identify more with urban black kids because of their understanding of, and lack of, privilege. I am not saying that you should water down your scenario, I am saying that you should portray your orcs in a way that would never make you ashamed to tell some minority that the orcs actually represent their people, even if they don't. Describe them with honor when you show how they really are, even while you paint them as "savages" from the perspective of the settlers. Make them real people, not cartoon caricatures of the racial stereotypes that were always untruths about oppressed and colonialized people throughout history. When you would feel embarrassed to tell someone that the orcs actually represent their people, you are portraying a people who are not admirable, not real, and so you have set up a misrepresentation of all real world cases of colonialism and oppression. All of them were perpetrated on people that were admirable in their own way. You lose any legitimacy your efforts may have.<br/><br/>So in essence, I still think you are wrong. I am not saying that you are a bad person, or that your ideas are shit. The fact that I have spent a fair amount of my limited time addressing these things with you directly should tell you that I think the base of your ideas have merit, and that the intentions are something that I agree with. I am saying that the things that you say are hurtful, even if they are not meant to be. It is not the place of the offender to say what is offensive, it is the place of the offended to say so. I have thick skin. I have had to put up with much worse, I have had to put up with outright antagonism and overt racism. You are not racist, as far as I can tell. You just seem not to want to listen. I don't say this to you as a way to make "points" on a silly internet forum. I say them as a gift to you, because you deserve to hear it, because you have good intentions, and there is no malice in your plan. But malice in not needed to produce hurt. I say this so that you can understand better, and not make these mistakes again.<br/><br/>I understand that you feel offended that people have criticized your ideas, or that people have more than implied that you have racist tendencies. A better word for your mistakes are privilege and not racism. When you can get past insisting that everyone else just doesn't understand your intentions, and you come to a place where you can honestly investigate what others find offensive about your presentation of your ideas, then you will be in a position to ask for apologies. Intentions are irrelevant. Only the result matters. Until then, you still just sound like someone who is insensitive and does not want to listen.<br/><br/>I guess at this point, I should ask you to read my post charitably. Reading through it, it comes off as pretty pretentious. It is meant to be honest, and to meet you as close to where you are as possible, without being dishonest. I hope I didn't screw it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347496/#Comment_347496" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T06:20:52+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  6:20AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lee, you rock.

The best way to resolve things is to be compassionate and treat people how you would like to be treated. Everyone makes mistakes. Be nice and generous!

The last point in this post, though, is spot on for this thread and this forum, Please read the last paragraph, if not all of this lengthy post.<br/>_____________________________________________<br/>Lee; you are wrong in some of your presumptions, and that makes you wrong in the conclusions too.<br/><br/>I never presented my full game, or the full basis for my method, in the thread on indians. I never meant to. The thread was me trying to get some more knowledge that would help me as games-master. It was not a presentation of my game or method. So, as with others; you do not have the full picture. What you do have, is a construed picture where the fate of indians figure very prominently. But indians don't figure at all in my game. They're not part of it. There's no need for you, as an indian, to take issue with the orcs of my game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>I think that for a true understanding of oppression, we always have to come from the perspective of the oppressed,</blockquote>I absolutely disagree with you in this! How can you ever understand the <i>oppressor</i> if you never take his point of view? How can we ever understand the dynamics of <i>the oppressor and the oppressed</i>, if you forbid us all to explore the point of view of the oppressor? I'm not a stranger to self-cencorship, but having you telling me that I can not explore human conditions outside of your realm of experience, will not do. You are in the wrong when claiming this.<br/><br/>You need to understand, Lee, that exploring this type of conflict from the side of the oppressor, is not done to minimalize the suffering of the victims. It is done to understand the oppressor, to see how his brutality came to be, and what the foul deeds did to the humans perpetrating them. I hope you will see this, Lee, if anyone ever tries to make a role-playing game on the indian-white conflict of your homeland. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nameless</cite>When you would feel embarrassed to tell someone that the orcs actually represent their people, you are portraying a people who are not admirable, not real, and so you have set up a misrepresentation of all real world cases of colonialism and oppression.

I am not ashamed to say that I have investigated several known conflicts of this kind, specifically how white europeans met with and treated africans, asians, indians and sami. I see no reason whatsoever to hide the fact that I am inspired by real events and humans, and prefer to be so, when playing with serious themes.<br/><br/>I am not <i>embarrassed</i> at all, Lee. I am <i>quite proud</i> of my careful research, the method I've designed, and the results I get in my games.<br/><i>(I know this puts me forward in ways that some will find provocative, but so be it; I am really not embarrassed)</i><br/><br/>I see no reason to hide my intentions, or my method, and have seen no real argument against any of them here. Of course; my method are not disclosed in full, in this matter, and so I am alone in evaluating how it works in this theme. I must lean on my experience, and on the practice I see unfolding in the actual games.<br/><br/>The games in questions are well underway. I started posting some game-reports here, but had no responses, so I've let that be. I'll give you a general outline:<br/>- the players of my games are full of conflicting initiatives, second thoughts and serious doubts as to what their characters should do. Some are thoroughly anxious, and want to murder all orcs. Some are thoroughly anxious, and want to engage in talks with the orcs. Some are heated, and some are trying to calm the situation. All of them are heartily engaged in the life and work of their characters, sharing in their happiness, and their tribulations. <br/><br/>Some characters did their best to save a hurt orc a couple of weeks back. At the same time one other character tried his luck hunting orc-heads for money. I make no moral judgement on the characters, or the players, I follow up and try to be realistic in consequences for orcs and men alike. My responsibility is for the game, and the bigger picture. If there's a moral to be had, or insights of any worth, the players must work it out for themselves. As long at the interaction is intense, the characters come alive, and I am equal to my task in the game, I'm pleased.<br/><br/>I take the happenings in the games so far as proof that my intentions are bearing fruit. I am quite confident that the multitudes of themes will blossom even more, as the dramatic events of the games so far starts feeding into future interaction.<br/><br/>It seems to me, Lee, that you are jumping to conclusions on a game that you do not really know. That is true for many posters here, when commenting on games by others. I've tried to say as much, to you and others, and would prefer it if you tried to take that into consideration. It is not only a question of "reading charitably"; it is a question of knowing the limits of your  perception, and not judging anyone, or any game, on a faulty basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347521/#Comment_347521" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T08:31:35+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  8:31AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2011 8:59AM by Todd_L.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel strongly that-- until you can correctly summarize someone-else's point of view; in a manner they-themselves would find satisfactory; without attempting to editorialize,refute, question their hidden motivations, or interpret what they 'really' mean; you are not yet qualified to rebut it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla" title="Sodzilla"><img alt="Sodzilla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla">Sodzilla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347528/#Comment_347528" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T08:48:05+00:00" title="November  1, 2011  8:48AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2011 9:04AM by Sodzilla.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Tomas, and how convenient it is for you that you don't have to give people the information we'd need to understand.

Needed some time to step away and think.<br/><br/>So, warnings (in private) are coming soon, the thread will be unlocked again for a day or two, then closed and fired into space.<br/><br/>Anyway, as the pulse of the site goes, there's no changing culture going on here, no shift in the way people are fundamentally behaving here. Some members leave, new ones come, but in the end the atmosphere flows in pretty much the same patterns.<br/><br/>Another interesting pattern: This isn't the first time that someone created a perfect storm of arrogance, lack of empathy, and self-entitlement, got burned by the reaction they received from the majority of the board, and after that created a new thread to talk about "How things seem to have gotten worse around here", drawing attention basically to the reactions their own posts caused. This is probably the fifth time it's happened, possibly more. One of the last times (slightly different case, of course; the other was a bully operating under the guise of aggressive, cold intellectual scrutiny sans empathy; I don't share a particularly positive view of Tomas in recent light but he does not come off as a bully) was particularly legendary, and involved the rewrite of hundreds of forum posts, a banning, and the term "Story-Cunts".<br/><br/>To the OP: You posted racy stuff and got burned. The fallout of that is a brief hammer-blow of a private discussion and warning, some general unease for a little while, some folks holding your views in a more positive light while many, many more simply won't want anything to do with you for a while (re "toxic"). Eh, it's just the nature of how online communities work. No tectonic plates in the community have shifted, rest assured that the sentiment was always there, you just happened to make it appear in the form it did in a spectacular way. <br/><br/>How can we turn the trend? Read what John/jenskot, then Jason said.<br/>And further:<br/>* Participate with empathy. When intellectual conquest trumps empathic understanding, flare ups like the recent ones occur.<br/>* Don't demand that people try to understand what you write, when you don't do the same for them.<br/>* Don't demand that people treat your views with respect, when you offer none in return.<br/>* Don't demand apologies, when you refuse to do the same.<br/>* Don't whine about people being wrong who refuse to listen when you "correct" them, when you keep your ears shut, and presume that you are infallible, to the corrections they are suggesting to your own misunderstandings.<br/><br/>...and that about wraps it up. <br/><br/>This was the voice of the forum. The forum doesn't hate anyone, nor does it wish anyone to leave. It doesn't crave blood (moderation and warnings are almost always done in private, no exception here), and doesn't hold a grudge. It wishes for everyone to become better as a result of the dialectic, and move on.<br/><br/>Hopefully everyone: The OP, others participating, will gain something from the discussion. For me, having John's "guide for participating in a forum", with Jason's addenda, all in one place to reread and meditate upon was almost... Almost... worth it all.<br/><br/>What next?<br/><br/>Some hours will pass as the thread remains locked<br/>Then this thread will be unlocked for a few hours for followups<br/>Then it'll be closed in a day or two permanently<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347972/#Comment_347972" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T12:43:21+00:00" title="November  5, 2011 12:43PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, this was not about issues.

When Lee said, in the kindest ways possible, that the way his culture was being used for Tomas' depiction of orcs was offensive, he was told that it in fact was not offensive.  He was told how to feel.<br/><br/>This is not about Tomas being racist to some far away people.  This is about Tomas being insensitive to a person who shared something deeply personal with him and with all of us.<br/><br/>My anger was not rooted in any kind of white, middle class suburban guilt.  My anger came from watching a person on these forums get treated poorly.  My anger was about having empathy with another human being.

I'd say his position probably came off the strongest in the entire thread.  What's there to be angry about in that?<br/><br/>Andy, I appreciate your words in that they lay out very clearly your position on these issues.  That position is somewhat of a surprise to me, given how impressively objective I've found you in the past vis-\xe0-vis the general culture here when it comes to the (happily slowly evolving away) other big contentious issue of trad versus indie.  Given that you have so strongly sided with a position where certain language and certain approaches are wrong and will not be tolerated here, I guess my own hesitation and wariness in posting here is well-founded and will continue.  I'm not angry about that or saying that in a passive-aggressive way, as I consider myself not truly part of the culture here anyways game-wise.  I just am going to speak out when I see fascistic tactics (ganging-up, silencing, shouting down) happen in forum conversations, doubly so when it comes from people with whom I generally share the same overall social values.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_347988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347988/#Comment_347988" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T14:15:33+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  2:15PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2011 3:44PM by TomasHVM.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm ok with Andy moderating his forum. He does a big service to all participants here, so of course he should be shown respect when setting the boundaries. <br/><br/>I've started this thread on behalf of people who have found it hard to make their voices heard here, and who have struggled to keep faith with the forum. Wether they find this response adequate or not, is not for me to say. I hope so, for the sake of this forum. Unique voices is something to treasure in a forum like this. Those big on shouting competitions are of less value to the forum.<br/><br/>I object to people shouting down opposition to their own prejudices, whatever theme we are discussing. Using harsh and hateful words to "win" a discussion is not for me. I will continue object to such behavior, but I will certainly guard my words on this forum, and be very careful in what themes I engage in. I'm a free-spoken man, and that is a great help in my affairs, generally, but I'm not especially interested in being the focus of controversy.<br/><br/>I'm committed to sharpening my skills as a gamesmith. Discussing with my peers is an important element in that. I will continue to do so here.<br/><br/>I'm committed to increase my knowledge too, with refinement on a personal and professional level as it's aim. I see my insights as a basis for all design-work I do, and a basis for my work as a professional GM. Continuing to seek out such knowledge is something I will do as long as I live, but not on this forum.<br/><br/>In the long run I hope that my volume of games will speak for me. I hope some of my games will outlive me, and become treasures to people coming after us. That is all a gamesmith can hope for, in my view, and it far outweigh shifting popularities, here or elsewhere.<br/><br/>I'm glad Andy took hold of this, and have used his wit to deal with it calmly and wisely. That is really a boon to this forum.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347989/#Comment_347989" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T14:19:41+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  2:19PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As we're apparently taking amicus briefs on Andy's opinion, I probably shold go on record as agreeing with Olman. Seems that we often think alike regarding the kind of discussion environment we'd like to have: more <i>polite</i> and less "empathetic", insofar as the latter involves defending your politics with distasteful social warfare and treating other people badly when they fall into your subjective badguy-boxes. The worst Tomas can be accused of here is his usual arrogance (self-confidence, satisfaction with his abilities as a roleplayer) in <i>communication</i>, while the reactionists threw polite discourse out of the window at the first sight of a hint of somebody maybe disagreeing with their dearly held truths. The further discussion demonstrated that there was no substantial basis whatsoever for being angry at Tomas, not unless you think that jumping the gun and not asking for clarification is substantial. I do not understand how common ground could be found playing by those rules, except the sort of common ground you find by scaring everybody into conformance.<br/><br/>While I critique Andy's sentiment in judging Tomas, his actual, light-handed moderation pleases me, as usual. You'll note, Olman, that Andy's not actually doing anything to take sides in this matter, so he's already better than most people about moderating a web community. The facts he lays out are profound truth: speak up in controversial ways and you'll get a reaction from the Internet. I wouldn't have a comment on this matter were it not for the need to counter-balance the impression that Tomas was somehow the one out of line here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347990/#Comment_347990" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T14:21:37+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  2:21PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I was used as a specific example in this thread I guess I should probably say something.<br/><br/>My words are not indicative of any sort of overall Story Games culture.

If Andy thinks that they went beyond the bounds of the acceptable here and determines some moderator action is necessary then I accept that without any hard feelings.<br/><br/>What I don't accept is dismissive, self-important intellectualism in place of emotionally honest discourse. I'm not unfamiliar with Tomas' posting voice, and I don't recall he and I ever having any issues before the thread from which my quoted words were taken. I did not participate in the Indians/Orcs thread and I'm probably incapable of determining if someone is being racist online without what to me would be more obvious indicators. My issues were solely about the mode of "discussion" taking place in the referenced thread.<br/><br/>Overall, Andy's post sums up my feelings about the matter very well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347991/#Comment_347991" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T14:22:38+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  2:22PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love that Tomas can disregard another person's feelings, use a culture as fodder for orcs, ignore dozens of pleas to be a better listener and then come on this thread and play the role of the rational one.<br/><br/>The next step is playing the card that in fact you were the wrong party, Tomas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla" title="Sodzilla"><img alt="Sodzilla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla">Sodzilla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347993/#Comment_347993" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T14:34:41+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  2:34PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that Lee/Nameless came across very strongly in that he presented his point of view clearly and calmly, and behaved admirably throughout. <br/><br/>Whether he somehow "won" the thread, or felt he'd been listened to and shown respect, isn't for me to decide. But if I'd been treated the way he was, I would not have felt like a winner.<br/><br/>Also, arrogance in talking about trad RPGs vs. indie RPGs or similar... is not in fact the same thing as arrogance in discussing other people's life experiences.

It was about one side saying some variation of "what you have said offends me, and that brings with it an obligation on you to change your behavior to placate my offense" and the other side saying some variation of "no".<br/><br/>And now a judgement: if you are the offended party in such a case, you can scream, you can reason, you can try to convince, you can even find the guy and punch him in the face; however, you almost certainly lack any authority to force a change in the offender's mind. You <i>definitely</i> lack the ability.

As in, I felt like I understood both of them better, and had to make fewer assumptions about what they were saying and/or who they were as people. This doesn't mean I agreed with either of them any more or less, but it focused whatever disagreement there was on things they were actually saying, and ways they were actually acting.<br/><br/>I'm happy that both of them stuck with the conversation, and I'm happy that I followed it long enough for things to become clearer. And nobody is under any obligation to stick with a thread like that, but I do feel that people who passed judgment quickly, in either direction -- and made a point of bringing that judgment into the thread -- have a greater responsibility to stick with it (as a reader) and see if their judgment bears out. (Greater, not absolute, sometimes you're just too pissed off or it just isn't worth it for whatever reason.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348022/#Comment_348022" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T17:09:36+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  5:09PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to open with an apology. The quote that Andy picked me up on was much too vaguely put, at least in the second half, and probably came across as six times snarkier than indeed. I agree with more or less everything Andy said in response. Indeed, empathy is the reason I'm in these discussions - I don't have a dog in this fight otherwise. So sorry about that. I must learn to delete my throwaway comments - they're always the ones that cause the most trouble. If anyone wants to know what I really meant, whisper me, but it's not important any more, if it ever was.<br/><br/>Eero said most of my opinion already, but I'd like to point out that there is more than one question being discussed here, and these include:<br/><br/>(i) Whether the game that Tomas is running is in some way intrinsically unethical because of its treatment of racial and cultural issues, for example by equating Indians with Orcs<br/>(ii) Whether Tomas's game will in fact work as he intends, or will go horribly wrong in some way<br/>(iii) Whether Tomas's tone in these discussions is something that people find unacceptable<br/><br/>I think (i) is settled beyond all reasonable doubt: it doesn't do that and it isn't offensive. Information about what Tomas was doing emerged in a misleading way, especially if you hadn't been reading his "Colonial Fabula" thread, and gave a terrible initial impression, but to quote Lee, since he puts it so well, "This thread may have been a little different if this was in the opening post...So the goal is to explore the racism and xenophobia inherent in colonialism, in a somewhat generic situation, using fantasy as an analogy to remove people from the easily taken stance that "Humans are humans, duh..." [long description of some good ideas about how to make this work]... If you can pull that off, it will be a campaign of legendary status." Lee, if you think I'm misrepresenting you here, please do correct me, but my impression of your posts is that once Tomas had explained himself properly, you basically approved of his intent, but you had misgivings about whether it would work as intended.<br/><br/>(Some people have argued that I should be open to the possibility that Tomas's campaign *really is* offensive, just because some people have thought so at some time. I disagree. If someone has misread DitV so badly that they think Vincent is an apologist for Mormons being the sole repository of truth, they are simply mistaken, and Vincent doesn't have to take their feeling of offence as a serious criticism of DitV, nor should he. To my mind, reading Tomas's campaign as "American Indians were smelly evil subhumans" falls exactly into this category. It's just a complete mistake, albeit a far more understandable one.)<br/><br/>Which brings me to (ii). Whether Tomas's ideas will truly work as intended is very hard for anyone to say, even Tomas. But if you take him at his word, he runs a kind of RPG that is markedly different from those that most of us play, and he has put in a truly extraordinary amount of time doing so, more than most of us can even dream of doing. This being so, I don't have the chutzpah to tell him what I think will and won't work at his table. If you do, dear reader, good luck to you, but don't be surprised if he doesn't take your advice very seriously; I haven't noticed him asking for it. (And if you don't take him at his word, I can't understand why you're wasting your time offering him advice. That just seems illogical.) You may think Tomas is arrogant for ignoring your advice, but he may just be being realistic. I really don't see how you can be sure which it is.<br/><br/>Lastly (iii), which is obviously a matter of opinion. I think many of the complaints levelled against Tomas are in fact that people don't like his posting tone, whether they say so clearly or not. I'll be frank: I'm not wild about it myself at times. But I don't know how much of it is a deliberate choice, how much is Scandinavian vs British culture, how much is the handicap of not being able to post in Norwegian, and how much is the familiar problem of online communication. I choose to give him the benefit of the doubt as far as I can, firstly because I think that's a good idea, and secondly because he shows every sign otherwise of being patient, kind and thoughtful. If you (dear reader) choose to cut him less slack, that's your decision, but own it as your choice to do so and be prepared to justify it if asked, rather than taking umbrage.<br/><br/>My learning point in all of this is that if I am *ever* going to ask people for information about their families, their culture, their traditions, any kind of history that arouses controversy, I am going to make damn sure that I explain at the very outset exactly why I am asking, and exactly what I plan to do with that info. Because it's very difficult to change people's impressions later on when they have the wrong end of the stick and are justifiably angry (in the sense that what they perceive would indeed be offensive). <br/><br/>I don't blame anyone for misreading Tomas originally. The situation was confusing, and it was almost bound to happen. But I'm critical of the tendency to condemn rather than question, and I'm struggling to see how some posters are apparently maintaining a sense of offence even now. What is this ongoing wound? How can it be healed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken" title="Troels Ken"><img alt="Troels Ken" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troels%20Ken">Troels Ken</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348028/#Comment_348028" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T18:21:07+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  6:21PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In terms of "bad culture", my problem is not with colonial fantasy &amp; orcs/indians as such. Around here we did that 20 years ago, so it doesn't seem all that edgy. My problem is with specific points of debating technique, dismissable as "tone" if that 's your thing, but a bit more technical than that.<br/><br/>To be precise, my problem is with Tomas demanding that his interpretations be treated as neutral, objective fact. The concrete interpretations were 1) orcs are a neutral, content-free symbol, rather than an accepted shorthand for "humanoid non-people monsters that it's morally OK to kill and plunder" and 2) you can base your ficticious orcs and the in-play situations that you set up with them on native american history and still fairly claim that they contain no smidgin of native american. Both of these are debatable, to say the least. Once the native american cat came out of the bag, Tomas demanded, stridently, that his interpretations on these rather important points be treated as neutral and unassailable fact rather than interpretations. This came across to me as aggravatingly arrogant, not to mention unconstructive. I suspect a lot of the rancour grew out of that.<br/><br/>In terms of debating culture, I believe it is quite important to distinguish between really factual facts and personal interpretations, no matter how fond one might be of them. Oh, and for what it's worth, I'm scandinavian too, so no great cultural chasm at work here.<br/><br/>Also, flirting by pissing on people's feet? Really? If for some strange reason I wanted to communicate "mating habits of the yellow bellied tree wee as told by David Attenborough" rather than "customs of ethnic group NN", that is one BRILLIANT touch. If the intention wasn't a masterful show of othering in practice, not so much. Yes, I realise this is sarcasm, and as such not itself a constructive debating technique, but... flirting by pissing on people's feet?!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348045/#Comment_348045" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T21:05:13+00:00" title="November  5, 2011  9:05PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys,<br/><br/>This isn't about how Tomas' game plays out at his table.  This isn't about some kind of academic anthropology, where we look at some kind of checklist and once a certain amount of checks are ticked off, our disapproval is set off.<br/><br/>Again, this is very personal.  It is about someone sharing intimate details of their life and having those details turned to the creation of an ugly metaphor, a hideous fantasy creation.  You can toss up all of the red herrings you want: "Its only orcs!" "Maus!" "You word choices could have been nicer, Judd!"  The face is someone posted a thread asking for details and when those details were shared by Lee in an amazing post, the bait and switch was unveiled.<br/><br/>Mistakes happen but once it was pointed out to be problematic, we were assured that we were just reading it incorrectly.<br/><br/>And the red herrings continue.  From the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15306&amp;page=1#Item_18" rel="nofollow">"Hey look! I talked to a non-white person once and it was awesome...also, poetry!" reputation repair thread</a> to chastising me for not being nice enough and saying that we shouldn't say anything in support of Lee.<br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>You can hide under the flimsy umbrella of rational discourse all you want.  Shitty things can be said with a perfectly level, rational tone.<br/><br/>When you take the details of someone's life and make something shitty out of it, you can be sure that I will tell you its ugly when I think its ugly.  I'm sorry if that is too much for your delicate, rational discourse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348049/#Comment_348049" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-05T22:30:18+00:00" title="November  5, 2011 10:30PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2011 10:31PM by Todd_L.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never, in all the history of the Sanctimonious Olympics, have I ever seen such a spectacular two-way tie for the Gold, sportsfans.<br/><br/>Not since the 1971 bout between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison#Early_years" rel="nofollow">Jim Morrison</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXvqaBw_iA" rel="nofollow">Billy Jack</a> have two white knights felt such pain of the American Indian with more passion.<br/><br/><br/>I salute the Norwegian and the American contenders, high atop their respective horses.   <br/><br/>I do so, not just on my own behalf, but on behalf of a poor little diabetic Hopi girl.
