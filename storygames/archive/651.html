                    I'm going to keep this topic-starter short, because I am SO procrastinating and I really shouldn't be here at all right now.<br/><br/>How do you know when your neat idea demands a new game to be designed to express it?  How do you know when it wants to be an expansion to an existing game?  How do you know when it should just be a campaign and leave it at that?<br/><br/>I do have a concrete example in mind: I've got an idea for a WWII superhero espionage game which I can't quite figure out what to do with.  It's Alan Furst crossed with Joe McCarthy, but I have no idea if I should be designing a game around the notion, or writing an expansion for <i>Godlike</i>, or just doing a campaign, or what.  Hopefully hearing your answers will inspire me to make up my damn mind.<br/><br/>--Jess                </div>

                            See, I start writing things as expansions, like <i>Vesperteen</i> being a variant of <i>Little Fears</i> and <i>Lions on the Precipice</i> being a variant of <i>Dogs</i>...<br/><br/>And then I decide that I have to basically re-write the whole game and create something new in order to meet my design goals.  So I end up with yet another design project.  It's annoying.<br/><br/>I think something I want to move towards is altering existing systems in dramatic ways for use in specific campaigns.  Like Shreyas rewrote the entire Exalted combat system recently, and we'll probably only use it for one IRC game before he rewrites it again.<br/><br/>Not everything needs to be a completely new game.  And if it does, maybe it's something you could just use for a couple one-shots for your home group or you might print 20 copies of it at Kinkos to give away.  For example, nobody really desperately needs a copy of <i>Seadog Tuxedo</i>, my pirate penguins game.  It's fun and neat, but you probably wouldn't want to play it for more than 3-4 sessions.<br/><br/>Roleplaying is ephemeral.  It's only natural that some design projects and entire games should be ephemeral as well.  Not everything should be an opus.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't put all your design chops into it.<br/><br/>So, yes and no.                        </div>

                            I remember Jared Sorensen gave some good advice once about only adding two or three strange new mechanics or rules subsystems for any given design. If every little thing is freaky and new, then nothing in your design is going to stand out.<br/>
<br/>
So I have two or three conflict resolution methods and one character creation method that I reuse with minor modifications for every game. Some of my games are going to be "that one core system, plus these rules for reincarnation (or rocketship battles, or folk sorcery.)" Others are going to need stranger rules to cover the complete feeling I'm trying to convey in that game. So most of the time, my decision is to extend. If I have to extend in three ways, that's a completely new system.                        </div>

<p>Talysman, I wouldn't count on the wisdom of that comment of Jared's. I mean, I think Vincent regrets not making Dogs a little more revolutionary, and Jared regrets his lost innocence of the age of GM fiat.</p>
<p>I think you modify some mechanics you like to make them do something you want a little bit better, then you test, revise, test, revise, test, and after a while, you have a new mechanic.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as "too revolutionary". There is, however, incomprehensible.</p>

<p>It's not just Jared.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it's a restatement in RPG terms of T. S. Elliot's commentary on characters in fiction: you can have a bizarre character in an ordinary world, or an ordinary character in a bizarre world, but not a bizarre character in a bizarre world, because there's no point of familiarity to draw the reader in.</p>
<p>Don't confuse this with being revolutionary. First, because it's not wise to get too hung up on being revolutionary, 'cause then you're just trying too hard. People can smell a poseur a mile off. Second, the really revolutionary stuff is subtle. It's taking something people are familiar with <em>in another context</em> and applying it in a strange new way. You can use a lot more context shifts than totally new concepts in a game because context shifts by their nature are completely comprehensible..</p>

                            (Thunder God--I just posted a comment directly to your blog answer, some of which gets repeated here in a different form)<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if you do know until you have pushed and pulled at it a little.  It may be that I just don't have enough experience to know early on, but I don't realize I have a robust enough concept that stands on its own until I have really tried to make it fit with a pre-existing system and it just hasn't worked.  <br/>
<br/>
Even then, I can't be entirely sure that the idea itself is just not screwy, so I have to fidget it with a little using the original system.  If it still won't work, then I begin to start building a system around the idea, seeing if that goes somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
And it may be that it works very well with one system but would just be oh so much cooler with a system of its own to support it...or you build a cool system only to realize there is an entirely different system out there that would support it even better.<br/>
<br/>
It's not an exciting answer, maybe even bordering on the banal--"you know because when you create a system around it, something cool happens."  It's craft, it's experimentation.  You know by doing--what is it Linus Pauli said?  Genius is just two things: a means for producing lots of ideas and a means for selecting out the good ones.<br/>

                            Hi Jess:<br/>
<br/>
Your idea definitely sounds cool.<br/>
<br/>
I'd think about two things in terms of existing game vs. new game.<br/>
<br/>
How much would you have to add to [existing game] to make your idea work?<br/>
<br/>
How much does the stuff already in [existing game] help make your game work?<br/>
<br/>
Trying it out using an existing game would, I think, be an awesome way to answer those questions.                        </div>

                            Thunder_God:<br/><br/>I think you're not quite answering the question in a way that's useful to me, but I absolutely agree with what you say.  I've been a designer since I was just a kid, even before I had the tools to talk or think explicitly about what I was doing.  The number of open projects on my plate should tell you just how bad I've got the bug!<br/><br/>What I don't yet have a good sense of is how to figure out the needs of a project, and when/whether/how I can build off established work.  I'm a part of a number of different role-playing-related communities, and in some of them the assumption is, "Run a campaign," in some it's "Write an expansion," and in others (like here) it's, "Write your own damn game."  But I haven't yet figured out a good way to tell how much of what I'm hearing has to do with social assumptions in the community, and how much has to do with the genuine needs of the project.  There was a thread around here a while ago about how older games (I think White Wolf was the example) have gotten a lot of refinement, but there are a limited number of people expanding on and revising the kinds of games we make here, and how a culture of expansions might actually be good for us.  That's what got me thinking about this issue.<br/><br/>For some of my projects, it's clear that there's nothing out there that will serve me, or where I have really specific ideas of how it differs from similar games in the same space.  These projects are definitely getting games of their own.  For some of my projects, though, there are things that are kind of near it, and I'm not sure how to figure out when it might be fruitful to borrow and what kind of borrowing is okay.<br/><br/>I'm fundamentally pretty lazy, so I don't necessarily want to reinvent the wheel - but I also don't want to waste a lot of time trying to make my round game fit into a square hole.<br/><br/>This thread is giving me some useful ways to ask the questions that I need to ask, though.  I may start a separate thread if and when I need help answering some of them in specific.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>For the moment, I think I'm going to take Matt's advice (and Jonathan's implied advice) and try running a session or two of this game in four or five different systems.  I imagine I'll quickly see the places where there's friction, but maybe there'll be one that works nicely.<br/><br/>As usual, you guys rock.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Regarding Jared's comment about strange new things - with apologies to Jess for continuing a derailment - that's only possibly a useful guideline to the degree that you view the different components as independent items.</p>

<p>That's a fascinating line of thought. Where do you see such a culture of expansions going? To take a deliberately odd example, consider <em>N</em>obilis. What directions do you see that expanding in? (I have my own thoughts about this, but I don't want to drown yours out.)</p>
