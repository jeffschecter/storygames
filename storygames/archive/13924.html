(It gets its name because it's essentially Cthulhu Light, but you can't call a Cthulhu game that, so it's Dark.)<br/><br/>I've been playing this for a while and it works remarkably well. The rules are fun and incredibly minimal: they fit on one sheet of paper. You don't need a character sheet to play, so you can start playing after two minutes of prep. And, despite the simplicity, there are some interesting rules twists: look at the Suppressing Knowledge rule for an example.<br/><br/>At the moment, it's designed for running prewritten Cthulhu scenarios. In time, I'd like it to work for improvised and perhaps GMless games. There'll be some equivalent of Apocalypse World's Fronts, which lets you advance the horror bit by bit.<br/><br/>Also, here is a really important thing. One of the main reasons for writing Cthulhu Dark was that people wanted to buy my scenarios without buying a rules book. So, I wrote Cthulhu Dark, to let me publish them as standalone products.<br/><br/>You can do the same. I know various people on Story Games write Cthulhu scenarios: if you want to publish them, without being dependent on an external system, you are very, very welcome to use Cthulhu Dark. Put simply, you include Cthulhu Dark at the back of a scenario, free of charge, and publish it as a standalone thing. <a href="http://www.thievesoftime.com/news/?page_id=146" rel="nofollow">Here are some more details</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315446/#Comment_315446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T07:33:10+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  7:33AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,  <br/><br/>This is super cool.

Is the idea that you can always have a reroll (and just one, right?), as long as there is a chance it triggers an increase in Insanity? Is this intended to interact with the fiction in any way, or is it just a simple resource-management thing: you can reroll whenever you like, but at the risk of increasing your Insanity score?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315459/#Comment_315459" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T09:39:07+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  9:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ash, the layout is by Brennen Reece.

When you roll and fail, you fail in the story. You can try again if you push yourself (i.e. roll the Insanity Die).<br/><br/>They are elegant in different ways. The first is mechanically elegant, quick and doesn't fuck with the narrative. The second is elegant because it answers the perennial question: "Can I just try again?". Go ahead, knock yourself out.<br/><br/>The question of whether you only get one reroll? That's deliberately unspecified. It works either way, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315464/#Comment_315464" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T09:52:28+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  9:52AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2011 10:01AM by John_Powell.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Graham, in some prewritten Cthulhu scenarios investigators run into things that are so mind blowing they automatically lose some sanity even if they make their roll.

For example, there's no concept of Cthulhu being more scary than a Colour.<br/><br/><i>Every Mythos creature is fucking terrifying</i>. If you're up against a Colour, it will drive you mad, just as Cthulhu will drive you mad, just as the Deep Ones will drive you mad.<br/><br/>So simplify, simplify, and keep Insanity to a single mechanic.\n<blockquote>Anybody have the maths to tell me how many Insanity rolls it takes on average to reach 5 Insanity? Or better yet, how long before it's likely that 1 out 4 or 5 players reaches 5? This could be very useful for planning/pacing adventures...</blockquote>\nTen is the magic number. Put ten things, in your scenarios, to shock the Investigators. On average, with a group of five-ish investigators, that will send one mad.<br/><br/>Or here is an alternative way to calculate it. When the Investigators roll 6s when investigating, they will glimpse beyond human knowledge. This will probably give them Insanity rolls. <br/><br/>So, actually, put about six specific things in your scenarios to shock the Investigators. Also have a rag-bag of horrors that they will glimpse while investigating. (For example, if you have Innsmouth jewellery in your scenario, they might glimpse the grotesque creatures depicted in it.)<br/><br/>(Also, I think you mean 6 Insanity. You go mad when you reach 6. What you'll find is that, at the end, almost everyone is on 5 Insanity, one step away from madness.)\n<blockquote>I plan on using CD to run a Cthuhu Rising scenario (Fragmented Sanity).

So this style of play used to be my MAIN style of play back when I ran a whole lot of Chill.  In Chill you had this gradation of success.  All the published scenarios had this break down of what information you would learn at each level of success.  Often these were as fancy as fairly elaborate hand outs.  On a basic success you get the birth certificate.  On a medium success you get the birth certificate and the land deed.  On an extra-ordinary success you get the birth certificate AND the land deed AND the newspaper article.<br/><br/>I see that idea in Trail of Cthulhu with the whole "having the skill gets you the basic and necessary information and spending points gets you more."  And now I see that here with whole 1 gets you basic and necessary information and higher values get you more.  So that's three different games that all raise this basic question:<br/><br/>Why as the GM am I generating all this excess creative work that the players might never actually see?<br/><br/>The ONLY context I can imagine that, that is at ALL creative or socially fulfilling is if you actually go and publish your adventure and that it gets played multiple times, across multiple groups such that each group experiences a slightly different distribution of your content.<br/><br/>Without that publishing context why would I do this to myself in my home game?  Why would I write fake articles and newspaper clippings and documents that the players might never actually see because we're only going to play the thing once?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315505/#Comment_315505" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T15:37:45+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  3:37PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it always boggled you, why did you play Chill a whole lot?

Here was my general pattern.<br/><br/>For the *first* adventure I'd put in the work.  This inevitably led to me staying up into until like 4am the night before the session frantically writing up newspaper articles and psychic dream sequences and land deeds and birth certificates and letters.  Then during play the players wouldn't see like 50% of it.<br/><br/>So, I'd sit there feeling like an exhausted idiot and for most future sessions I'd just write the basic clues and hand those out no matter the outcome.  I still felt like an idiot for not being able to play the game "correctly" but at least I wasn't exhausted.  I liked the clue chain setup but could never understand why the game advocated generating so much content you wouldn't need.  I always assumed there was some hidden play culture I wasn't keyed into for which there was something else going on here I didn't understand or know about.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315510/#Comment_315510" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T16:03:28+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  4:03PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just make my players do all that crap.<br/><br/>"Wow, you rolled really well!

There isn't an official answer, because Cthulhu Dark lets you work out those levels of information for yourself. But here is how I do it (and it is the method outlined in <a href="http://catchyourhare.com/files/Cthulhu%20Dark%20Tales.pdf" rel="nofollow">Dark Tales</a>). This will be rather long.<br/><br/>First, decide what the Investigators will discover if they roll a 4. For example, the Investigators are questioning a brothel keeper about a regular visitor to the brothel. You decide that, if they are successful, they will get this clue:<br/><br/><i>The gentleman was well-dressed and wore a yellow scarf. He visited a different girl every night. Afterwards, he got a cab back to St Giles Church.</i><br/><br/>Now, if the Investigators roll a 5, they discover <i>everything humanly possible</i>. So you need to make more stuff up! <br/><br/><i>The gentleman was well-dressed and wore a diamond tie-pin and a yellow scarf. He visited a different girl every night. It reminds you, strangely, of a tale of a man called Yellowscarf Jack. He had a dark reputation and people in the East End were terrified of him. But that folktale was from Georgian times: there is no possibility he could still be alive. According to the folktales, he regularly prayed at St Giles Church.</i><br/><br/>All this stuff is easy to invent, by the way. Riff on a few familiar legends and add in some historical fluff. You could do it easily: your legends would be different, but they'd be as good.<br/><br/>If the Investigators roll a 6, they <i>glimpse beyond human knowledge</i>. So make weird stuff up! This is even easier, actually: throw around some supernatural references.<br/><br/><i>The gentleman was well-dressed and wore a diamond tie-pin and a yellow scarf. He visited a different girl every night. After he met them, the girls seemed <b>changed</b>, as though a part of their soul had drained away. Most oddly of all, every one of them bore a child afterwards, even Emily, who was 45 and whom the doctor said could never bear children. He prayed, they said, at St Giles Church.</i><br/><br/>The lovely thing is: as you make stuff up, you blurt out wonderfully horrific things. For example, that thing about all the girls getting pregnant? I invented that on Wednesday, during our game, while I was making stuff up. That thing about Georgian times? Same thing. Invented on the spur of the moment.<br/><br/>Now, that's not an official guide on How To Play. That's just how I play. But it illustrates the creative value: those extra levels of success force you to add richness and depth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315519/#Comment_315519" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T17:01:57+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  5:01PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>And you write those out before play, correct?<br/><br/>Don't you find yourself bursting to share the higher levels of success information when the players only roll that 4?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315520/#Comment_315520" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T17:10:11+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  5:10PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, no.

naturalistically because it helps you organize those levels of clues.  For example, it really helps the clue-creation if you decide "the killer was Fast Eddie, who is not very strong physically, but got the drop on his victim, and stabbed him with that curvy cult dagger, and tried to hide the body fast, before hurrying back to the wedding reception", because that essentially creates the levels of clues for:<br/><br/>* interrogating Eddie<br/>* forensically evaluating the victim<br/>* examining the dagger<br/>* looking at the crime scene<br/>* questioning wedding reception guests<br/><br/>Without further work.  Whereas if you go "huh, I bet they will question the reception guests" and try to work it out from there it's much harder and less rewarding.<br/><br/>Basically, it is verisimilitude training, helping you make a living world that feels real, because an artificial one is WAY too much work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bifi" title="Bifi"><img alt="Bifi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bifi">Bifi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359034/#Comment_359034" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T06:44:34+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  6:44AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham,<br/><br/>one thing I am not entirely getting.

I could conceptualise it for myself in the following way:<br/><br/>Our culture is based on the idea of autonomous individual subjects. The human mind is encultured from the very childhood, trained to conduct techniques enacting the sense of the self, enacting the "proper" boundary between oneself and others. We're taught to make sense of the world with constructs of linearity of time and stable or objective reality, taught to perceive oneself as a unity of body, emotions and the mind bound by will, led to believe in control, autonormy and free will, The very language one needs to master to be able to learn about the world and oneself is already giving a certain picture of the world and the self, and this picture is not easy to break. As a culture we do whatever we can to forget that there is nothing like free will, that our nervous systems work like electrical conductors trying to resonate in tune with the frequency of the social group, that our reactions are pre-programmed, that we are like empty books, inscribed by the blind force of the collective being. Antisocial psychopaths, raving poets, monks, ascetics and cultists are among those who realise that this is an illusion, that their own selves are just figments, unstable constructs, and that human society with all its norms and values is just a blindly self-reproducing convention, below which there is nothing. As a result, some destroy themselves, some through "unlearning" cease to be what we would recognise as human, some turn their anger and frustration towards the society, either in their striving for power treating people like cattle or believing that destroying the whole of human society will get rid of an abomination and move the universe closer to perfection. (I haven't quite figured out yet what would Lovecraftian entities be in this vision, but bear with me.)<br/><br/>In Cthulhu Dark, characters willing to risk their sanity are risking this encultured perception and enactment of stable and human-friendly reality. They are willing to lose themselves, to melt the boundaries of their egos, to deconstruct the very language giving the seemingness of order, to return to the flow of pure being, to give oneself to the interplay of cosmic forces, to unbecome. They go too far, they forget or dissolve themselves in the task. They go too deep, uncovering the essence of what it means to be human, and risk that it obliterates under their penetrating gaze. All of Graham's examples can be read in this light.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
