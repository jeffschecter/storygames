I've been playing it recently with two separate MCs (GMs), and I've thought the game over a lot. Your insights are appreciated, here's my own take.<br/><br/>I like the world and the details, and I like about the transparency of PbtA. I like how focused the playbooks are. The game has some nice touchy-feely flourishes, like Directives (you get XP from doing tangential, colorful stuff) and Links (your relationship with another character has an effect on your success). Some of this was probably inherited from Apocalypse World in some form.<br/><br/>There's too much detail in the game for me, both in character creation, the setting creation and the actual play. Too many ways to influence the game in too small ways. It's hard to remember your options and hard to keep track of everything, especially as the game progresses, especially for someone like me, who's more interested in character and mood. Playing a Hacker felt especially complex, playing a Hunter feels more manageable. <br/><br/>The Sprawl has an interesting mission structure, where getting hired and paid is mechanized. The problem is, there are no hard rules for mission failure, so the MC pretty much has to decide when it fails. I think the game would profit from a more rigid mission structure that puts individual rolls in a clear context. Right now it feels the MC can just call for more rolls until she thinks the players have suffered enough. This didn't feel like a problem in AW, where there was no larger adventure structure.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459822/#Comment_459822" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-02T18:17:27+00:00" title="February  2, 2017  6:17PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only played the Sprawl once, but I agree with your criticisms.

However, I must admit that the book sometimes insinuates a more gamey structure than how it should really play. The book decides to give you <i>more</i> information than what is necessary, in an attempt to inspire MC's and give them a net. I asked the creator if I was okay during my actual play (by playing the MC moves fast and loose) and he ensured me I was running it fine. <br/><br/>The only critique I have is the Hacking moves, which I haven't used in-game, simply because they are a bit intimidating and dense (not dense compared to other systems, but dense compared to the other playbooks within the Sprawl). <br/><br/>I will say though that the system is very much aimed at playing mission-based cyberpunk, and not  character driven ambient cyberpunk. To get my players in the zone, I referenced films less like <i>Blade Runner</i>, and more like <i>Heat</i> and <i>The Town</i>, even <i>Ocean's 11</i>. Thats not say its devoid of interesting characters (I mean Danny Ocean is a great character), but its not about introspective characters. Even then we still had some great character moments in play. <br/><br/>Also the Sprawl has some amazing world building. My current campaign has us globe hopping. Johannesburg &gt; Osaka &gt; LA etc. All of them with their own cyberpunk issues.  And when the players fail, especially a mission, stuff follows them and hurts them and complicates their lives throughout the campaign.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty" title="frenzykitty"><img alt="frenzykitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/557/n6V5J0A17A1B2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty">frenzykitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459847/#Comment_459847" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-03T17:35:36+00:00" title="February  3, 2017  5:35PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very keen to try it now after reading these positive messages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459899/#Comment_459899" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-04T19:52:51+00:00" title="February  4, 2017  7:52PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2017 7:54PM by Upstart.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your input! \n<blockquote><blockquote>The problem is, there are no hard rules for mission failure, so the MC pretty much has to decide when it fails. <br/></blockquote>\nYes, there are.

I was looking at it from the wrong angle, trying to find how hard moves would advance the action clock.<br/><br/>It seems we all agree on how the system works in practice. Whether you want the MC to have this much power is up to you. I think the detail level of mechanics seems kinda pointless when the MC is responsible for the really meaningful things, but this is my issue with every trad game. You're free to disagree, of course. <br/><br/>How do you think a player should play The Sprawl? Just do what her character would?

If you, as a group, can agree (probably implicitly) on the criteria, you'll have a good time. But many people (as we can see from these threads) don't, or don't know how.<br/><br/>I can't speak to whether the Sprawl's text covers this, because I haven't read it. But in my (limited) experience playing the game, the issue was very apparent.

By agreeable criteria emerging from fiction, do you mean something that becomes obvious to everyone once it happens? This can be also framed as players accepting the MC's judgment call, because they have bought into the fiction, or don't want to start an argument. I think in a game like The Sprawl, "emerging from the fiction" pretty naturally becomes old-skool GM fiat, because there is no mechanized player input to influence the mission superstructure.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460118/#Comment_460118" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-10T17:14:14+00:00" title="February 10, 2017  5:14PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good example of a solution, I think, totally.<br/><br/>Another is establishing all the possible factors and obstacles beforehand, and just playing through them -

Something that crossed my mind is how powerfully this game seems to want to play with the players' psychology.<br/><br/>Frames are mental/emotional/phisiological states that you practice and then unconsciously apply.  They're why basketball players excel at their game, why you don't even have to try not to cuss at work, and why your mind works differently during a movie.  They're why teachers don't have to pee between noon and 3:30 and why cops who don't take crap on the street let a six year old wrap them around their little finger at home.  <br/><br/>Frames can also apply on the micro-level to things like racial bias and so forth, but for the moment, I want to talk about a more macro-level frame that The Sprawl uses.  Frames are very powerful when you use rituals to cue them.  The cop putting on the uniform, for instance, or the pastor asking the congregation to rise.  In RPG Theory we talk about the "magic circle" -- and that's borrowed from this sort of frame psychology.  <br/><br/>The Sprawl builds magic circles in the progress of the game.  It ritualistically begins the mission with the same move every time (no matter how different the fictional positioning) -- Get the Job.  And the Legwork Clock and Action Clock bound two different phases of the mission. Then the mission ritualistically closes with the Get Paid move.  Again, it may have different fictional outcomes, but for a few minutes the table looks up the same exact move and rolls and chooses from the same pick list.<br/><br/>As I run The Sprawl, I'm going to help the table carefully establish ideal norms and mores inside the magic circle of the mission the best I can (some pre-existing biases might help or hinder me).  I'm going to watch to see if the mission framework starts generating unconscious framework behavior sets.  It helps that most of my players have played Cyberpunk or Shadowrun and know the basic structure.  (Most of us also played through Dracula Dossier recently, which has an operational structure, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jonlemich" title="jonlemich"><img alt="jonlemich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jonlemich">jonlemich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468800/#Comment_468800" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-10T16:01:42+00:00" title="January 10, 2018  4:01PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of frames, for those of you who feel like The Sprawl is really traditional in its approach-- the mission system in The Sprawl is really just a "frame story."  (Unrelated to psychological frames).  The missions are just frames that we use to tell the real stories inside them.  They provide threats and antagonists, but also opportunities.  And all of that serves the Personal Directives.<br/><br/>The real meat of the mission is how it drives the PCs' Personal Directives.  The MC is supposed to provide an opportunity to get an XP from both Personal Directives for every PC, every mission.  For four players, that's 8 things to do -- which is really the thing I suspect I'm going to spend MOST of my time on as MC.  I get 6hrs for a mission, and in that time I have to trigger 8 Personal Directives.  I might plan some of the trigger events ahead, Apocalypse World style, just Thinking Offscreen and dreaming up ways to Complicate Everything and adapting them on the fly, but most of the time I'll be using my opportunities to make a Move in play to trigger those Personal Directives when I see a way to do it.  That puts the story ball firmly in the player's court - my move isn't "the corporations come and shoot you in the gut!" it's "the things you as a player chose to focus on in the story come and shoot you in the feels!" (and maybe the gut)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
