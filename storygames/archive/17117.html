An example<br/>would be a change in background color, or the difference (in poker) between a heart and a<br/>spade.<br/><br/>\u201cBiased\u201d randomness gives resources unfairly to one player over another; this includes most<br/>random events in most games.<br/><br/>\u201cFair\u201d randomness is the rarest type, and the hardest to master. It challenges players to think<br/>strategically in a randomized environment, but does not arbitrarily favor one player over<br/>another. For example, allocating different but equally valuable resources based on a die roll, or<br/>randomizing the starting setup in chess.<br/><br/>It is possible to have random elements in a game that fall somewhere in between these categories, but<br/>in those cases the multiple aspects of the individual mechanic can still be viewed through this filter.<br/><br/>Some examples:<br/><br/>Cosmetic: We don\u2019t talk a lot about Cosmetic Randomness, but its purpose is to provide variability<br/>without any impact on the game mechanics. It\u2019s easier and more prevalent in computer games.<br/><br/>Biased: This is the easiest form of randomness to introduce, and the most common. Here are some<br/>examples.<br/><br/>* A slot machine spin. Some spins are good, some are bad. In a slot tournament, whoever gets the<br/>luckier spins will win the tournament.<br/>* A roll in Settlers. This gives resources to some players, and nothing to other players.<br/>* A movement roll in Monopoly. This can land the player on a good or bad spot.<br/>* This-or-Nothing rolls, all over the world.<br/><br/>Fair: This is harder to engineer. Fair randomness should have a meaningful impact on the flow of the<br/>game without favoring one player over another. A strictly fair random event favors no one while slightly<br/>less fair events might only favor a certain player by a small margin. Some examples:<br/><br/>* A random setup in Chess (Chess 960)<br/>* Random starting layout in Settlers of Catan<br/>* This-or-That rolls (get Resource A or Resource <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/></blockquote>\nMy initial take is that roleplaying games don't really truck with fair randomness, but maybe I'm wrong.

Event randomizers are more about the tatical decisions of a change of state right now, while global randomizers would be more long-term strategic decision based.<br/><br/>It's also kind of interesting that he lists the Settlers roll as "biased" but the Settlers roll is really a this-or-that resource roll as listed under "fair".<br/><br/>Along a different axis on the graph of describing randomness, I would include "true" versus "biased". "True" being  a random number that is truly reflective of the outcome based on the possible known outcomes, and "Biased" being a random number that uses weighted tables.<br/><br/>For example, a roll of the resource dice in Settlers Catan is a true roll. The outcome of the roll should fall fairly close to the expected results over time for the roll of 2d6. In other words, 7 will be rolled more often than 2 or 12.<br/><br/>I would consider something like a wandering monster table to be biased. While your list 'o monsters may only included 10 possible monsters, some monsters are <i>weighted</i> to appear more often than others.<br/><br/>For example: rats 1-80, ghost 81 - 98, hungry dragon 99 - 100. While a true roll would have the rats, ghost, or dragon each have the monster randomly wander along roughly 1/3 of the time into the game, the bias of the weighted table will make the rats appear much more than the dragon.<br/><br/><br/>If the question is "do RPGs have any instances of randomizers that affects equally" I'd say stuff like randomizing doohickeys that help create the initial scenes or worlds would fall into that category.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388494/#Comment_388494" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T20:32:58+00:00" title="August 27, 2012  8:32PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if I agree that "Biased" rolls are inherently bad as James states but I do understand his logic.<br/><br/>Biased randomness means that the random event favors one player or another. In the end the randomness could even out over time but James' point is that it usually doesn't in the way you expect it to. One of his examples is in Settlers, you could randomly roll for resources and each player could, at the end of the game get the same number of rolls favorable to them but the players that got the resources earlier in the game are in a better position because statistically the resources are worth more at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>It's like if a character has to spend a resource early in a game, dependent on how the game is structured, could mean the character is going to lose most of their HP by the end of the game. Where as if they spend the resource late in the game, they only loose a few HP. Er, well I didn't actually explain that fully but if you follow, that's the kind of effect James is talking about.<br/><br/>In a collaborative game like most RPGs that effect may not be viewed as a bad thing. James' point is that it increases the chance that dice will determine who "wins" and limit the effectiveness of strategy.<br/><br/>To James, "fair randomness" is a random event that may make you re-think your strategy but that leaves the game ultimately to be won by the player with the best strategy. I was thinking this was more along with a roll or choose mechanic where if you rolled something you don't like you can choose (possibly from a different list) a result that is adequate.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure, but it might also include "yes but" and "no but" mechanics but this is kind of flipped on it's head at this point. Here you're getting what you want but with a penalty (or complication).<br/><br/>I see a lot of mechanics like those becoming increasingly popular. I'm not sure what I think about that. It sounds interesting but I like my biased randomness rolls. I would venture that both types are useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388510/#Comment_388510" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T00:09:42+00:00" title="August 28, 2012 12:09AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not crazy about the terminology either but maybe something like random allocation of characters or classes to the PCs is another example of his "fair" (assuming the classes/chars are all balanced).

The dichotomy between biased and fair randomness makes less sense in rpgs since you don't always compete with each others, and in many trad games any competition is a secondary priority at best. The way I read James Ernest, this would be a good procedure to determine what type it is:<br/>- Did it affect anyone's decisions?<br/>If no, it was cosmetic randomness.<br/>- If yes, was there a possible outcome that favoured one player over another?<br/>If no, it was fair randomness.<br/>If yes, it was biased randomness.<br/><br/>In Settlers, which random events are biased and which ones are fair is pretty clear cut. The starting layout is fair \u2013 no-on can say "aw, now all the mountain ranges are next to each other, that's clearly in Alicia's favor, she come out ahead of this randomisation". Rolling for starting positions might be considered fair, depending on how fair you deem the whole "place one house each clockwise, then one each counter-clockwise" is. If there's exactly one super-great spot and the rest of the map is crap, then obviously the one placing the first house came out ahead of the starting player randomization. Rolling for resources is definitely biased, as after each roll you can determine who gained the most from it. Drawing cards from the development deck is biased, since you might get good or bad cards (for your current situation in the game).<br/><br/>It's important to note that the actual result of a biased roll still might leave no player ahead of the others \u2013\xa0maybe you rolled a 2 for resources and no-one's built there yet, so no-one got any resources. It was still a biased roll, since some of the possible results would have favoured one player over another. Of all the map layouts possible, however, not one of them favours a specific player when it's drawn.<br/><br/>As soon as the different players don't view each others as opponents, this gets wierd. In a DnD combat with complete cooperation, there's two players for the sake of naming fair or biased randomness \u2013 the players and the monsters. An attack roll is obviously biased, because it can favour any side in the conflict. A wandering monster table is biased, since different monsters might be harder to beat. I have a hard time finding a fair random event in a traditional game when viewed like this \u2013\xa0maybe first deciding where to confront the monsters, then when you go there you randomise the layout of the map, then both the players and the monsters decide how to confront the situation. But since the PC group and the monster group are so assymetrical in resources and capabilities, odds are the randomisation of the map favoured one side over the other \u2013 if you deal a lot of fire tiles from the tile deck (or something) and the monsters have fire resistance, then obviously they came out ahead of the randomisation.<br/><br/>In indie story games where you might not even share your character's goal \u2013 the poor character just wants to finish the mission alive, but rules-wise you win the game if you die at the most dramatically appropriate moment (this is the case in Hollowpoint). In that case almost all rolls are still biased, it's just that the player might be the one favoured by the roll, but the character is not.<br/><br/><b>Why fair randomness is an edge case</b><br/>I'm actually going to go further than Jason and say that fair randomness is uncommon, and can almost only happen at the start of the game. A starting setup is fair in this sense. A this-or-that-roll probably isn't. If I play a card telling me to get one random resource, you might say that which resource I get (as long as they have the same value generally) is a fair roll, but only if I don't need any of them, or need all them exactly the same. Odds are, if the game has any complexity, that I'm going to prefer one roll over another if I think about it. If I need one of each to build the next house, and I don't have any of them, then yes either one will help me the same amount. But maybe Jack to my right also wants to build a house but already has a Coin? Then something other than Coin is better for me since I won't have to compete with Jack to get it later. Maybe I have to look to the future, and realise that after this house I'm going to need a shitload of Reed, and since reed is usually limited in supply I should get it as quickly as possible to avoid having it stolen from me.<br/><br/>Taken to it's extreme, this kind of thinking might be beyond the strategic skill of the player. Sometimes one roll is more favourable than another, but the player doesn't plan enough steps ahead to realise that. Has that roll then become fair? If so, the same roll can be fair to a newbie but biased to a skilled player. Or maybe fair as long as no-one playing is skilled enough but as soon as there's a pro at the table it becomes biased.<br/><br/>My point is that because of this muddy water regarding "fair" rolls in the middle of the game, the only rolls you can be sure to be fair is the ones that take place before any player has committed to anything. "Committing" here means taking any decision that limits one's future choices, which is most decisions in a well-designed game (exceptions are things like choosing player colour, maybe seating order). This means in most board-games, which take up to a few hours to play, the only room for fair randomness is at the very beginning. In rpgs this is simply more accentuated since the same game (in this regard) can run for multiple sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388517/#Comment_388517" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T03:03:34+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  3:03AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>So if the randomness is Everyone 1)falls into a pit, 2)gets a pie, 3)finds 10gp, 4)is fine.

If there are a few PCs, all collaborating toward a common goal, and a GM only acting as referee, it might be type 3 \u2013 because in reaching the goal option 1) and option 2) simply require different responses. If the conflict is between the PCs and the NPCs, then it's definitely biased since some of the options leave the PC's worse off than others. If the conflicts are between different PC's, with an impartial (or absent) GM, then it's probably biased since some PC's will handle falling into a pit better than others, or maybe one of the PC's even has a goal that's furthered (or less hindered) by falling into the pit. If everyone is truly affected exactly the same (like all PC's are mechanically identical and the effects of the roll are different purely mechanical effects) then yes, it's fair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388531/#Comment_388531" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T04:03:37+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  4:03AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My initial take is that roleplaying games don't really truck with fair randomness, but maybe I'm wrong.

If there is any meaning to the difference of resources, then a given player at a given time will want Resource A more than B or vice-versa.  For example, playing card games are usually "this-or-that" in some sense - you always get a card, but it isn't always the one you want.  The card that you don't want could be exactly the card that another player wants, though.  In many games, no cards are inherently valuable than others (like gin, or poker played hi-lo).  <br/><br/>This-Or-That is a design approach that can be used to make a randomized game into more strategically fair contest.  However, there are a lot of other approaches as well - such as bell curves, increasing number of rolls or reducing high-stakes rolls, and drawing from a small deck where a bad draw increases the chance of a good next draw.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure that making RPGs into a more strategically fair contest is all that important.  Indeed, many games deliberately have less strategic fairness.  Games like Fluxx or Talisman are not very strategic, but they are engaging to beginners for exactly this reason.  Likewise, D&amp;D lets a player get the thrill of their natural 20 roll even if he isn't particularly skillful at the game mechanics.  That's a feature that let's players shine from pure randomness (i.e. "unfairly").                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389710/#Comment_389710" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T17:05:34+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  5:05PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I just listened to the recording and I think we all (or at least me!) misunderstood the "fair" randomness that James is talking about.  <br/><br/>Fair randomness doesn't look at the current situation in the game, it looks at it in general.  So, "this-or-that" rolls (or, for example, drawing a Development card in Settlers) are fair, because in general all the cards are as valuable.  Situationally, one may be better or worse for me, but that's based on what I've done so far in the game.  So it's my fault if it's not good for me, because I have equal access to the development cards as everyone else, and could have played differently.

(Or maybe it just wasn't looked at the way I like to look at it, so I'm posting my perspective. Whatever.)<br/><br/>As a player in most RPGs, I have 2 distinct and not-always-compatible goals. Various games do better or worse jobs of satisfying those goals.<br/><br/>As character-advocate, I want my character to succeed at his goals. I want to accomplish missions and not-die and maintain my humanity and kill monsters and loot their stuff and all those things.<br/><br/>As player-audience, I want to contribute creatively to a story. I want interesting things to happen to my character and to other characters based on what the folks around the table are doing. I want drama or horror or comedy or moral dilemmas or whatever other rich story elements the game is promising me.<br/><br/>So here's the thing that I think Apocalypse-engine games do really well. They make all of the standard possible outcomes much more likely to be satisfying from the player-audience perspective. On a 10+ my character accomplishes what he was trying to do, and both the character-advocate side and the player-audience side get a bump. Yay. On a 7-9 my character gets a partial success and maybe I have to make a tough choice or take some consequences or something. Partial yay for my character and also fun as player-audience. On a 6-, I don't just get a blank wall of nothingness. Instead, I get some sort of creative contribution from the GM aimed at me that is customized for the moment. I get a moment of spotlight, even if it's a red-tinged spotlight. Boo as character-advocate, but yay as player-audience.<br/><br/>So what that does is make every die roll in an Apocalypse-engine game a "fair chance" this-or-that randomness, at least for the player-audience side.<br/><br/>I think that's huge. It's a game-changer. More than any other single thing, it's the reason why so many folks have borrowed the engine to make their own hacks.<br/><br/>By contrast, I would say that, in many cases, many old trad-style games focus on this-or-nothing interactions (succeed or don't) that produce negative results for the character-advocate side and do not do enough to assuage the player-audience side when those negative results occur. <br/><br/>Also, many of them do a poor job of incorporating the boundless possibilities of player creativity, such that the player-audience side of the brain is often more satisfied the more one gets away from the system. That leads to the "The session was great - we didn't touch the dice all night!"  syndrome.<br/><br/>(But I'm not here to bag on old trad games and raise defensive hackles. There's lots of potential fun there, and some of that fun can come from the failure. But at the moment, I'm a huge fan of how Apocalypse-engine games systematically reinforce making that failure fun happen. And in the context of Earnest's terminology, they do so by turning a this-or-nothing "biased" randomness into a this-or-that "fair" randomness, at least for the player-audience side of the brain.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408326/#Comment_408326" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T21:16:09+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  9:16PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I'm going to raise this thread from the dead because I just listened to the panel via the GoL RPG Design Panelcast.

The randomness itself has nothing much to do with process or outcome.<br/><br/>There's a moment in a game where the character has a chance of dying.<br/>In system A, the GM rolls a d20, if he rolls a 1, the character dies.<br/>In system B, the GM rolls a d10, if he rolls a 1, the player rolls a d6. The character dies if the player rolls a 1,2 or 3.<br/><br/>What's the difference between the two systems?<br/><br/>(This situation exists in pretty much every game with randomness, but players will invariably choose system B if they have a choice).<br/><br/>I also disagree that biased allocation of resources is unfair. Unfair means biased but with a judgemental extra that there's somehow something wrong with this part of the game. There's is nothing inherently wrong with biased allocation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408391/#Comment_408391" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T15:00:05+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  3:00PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>E.g., I don't know chess openings, but am otherwise pretty good at it.

I'm surprised by this conversation. While I agree that most use of randomness in the games we deal with is of the "biased" type (we include the randomness often to *create* unfairness - like when we resolve conflicts - rather than the other way around), I think that "fair" randomness and "cosmetic" randomness are alive and well.<br/><br/>Cosmetic randomness comes up in all kinds of random tables in all kinds of games. Not just Fiasco-setup kind of stuff, but all the way back to D&amp;D. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18085/lee039s-lists-sales-numbers-for-those-curious-about-such-things" rel="nofollow">Here's a whole thread</a> about someone selling cosmetic randomness. See also rolls which decide who-gets-to-describe-some-scenery, "roll for eye colour", die-of-Fate type stuff (like a GM saying, "Ok, how many people live on this floor of the building? I'm going to roll 3d10"), etc, etc.<br/><br/>I'm also fond of "fair randomness" in design. For instance, rolling 3d6 for stats in D&amp;D is clearly "biased randomness". However, you can do it a different way: for instance, you roll for all six stats, and the highest roll gets a 17, the second best gets a 15... all the way to the worst roll gets a 6. Everyone's stats will be "fair", just allocated differently. <br/><br/>Same goes for some kind of mechanic like determining what the weather is like. (Imagine a random system which determines what kind of maneuvers get a +1 during a given combat round: it's windy now, so Volley is at -1 but Knock Over is at +1.) While at given moments players will have preferred outcomes, I still think there's a case to be made for that to be a "fair" randomness: if it's "fair" in setup, I don't see why it wouldn't be "fair" in play. Like map generation in Settlers of Catan, we're creating a ground base for play; how you take advantage of it is up to you.<br/><br/>Similarly, I can imagine a game where you play a con man/hustler, and you have a list of NPC contacts. Every session we choose one at random: that person has a deal to offer you.<br/><br/>This could apply to mechanics, as well: like in "anti-Pool" (a variation of The Pool), where rolling determines whether you lose dice and get your say in the fiction, or someone else gets their say and instead you gain dice (which makes you more likely to get your say in the future). There's no question that this feels more fair than a lose/win, even if we might find ourselves preferring a particular outcome at a certain point in the game. So perhaps there's a continuum in play here.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth thinking about! I like the idea of trying to categorize different types of randomness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408403/#Comment_408403" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T16:50:11+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  4:50PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It still seems to me that what Ernest calls "biased" rolls are used to create a type of social fairness by giving everyone a chance to shine.  <br/><br/>In many games, unusual random results give spotlight time - especially if they are distinguished as "critical" by the system but to some degree even if they aren't.  Random distribution helps distribute the spotlight around.  So if Lee comes in to play and RPG, and she's had a rough day and isn't at her best.  She isn't popping with great ideas.  Still, she rolls a critical result at a good time, and she gets her moment in the spotlight.  Her friends high-five her for doing well.  This was "unfair" in the sense that Lee got the result when others didn't, but it was "fair" because everyone gets equal odds for lucky results like these.  <br/><br/>Now suppose that the only results were this-or-that rolls where every result is equally interesting.  As the saying goes, everyone being special to some degree means that no one is.  If she can't get a lucky roll, then Lee will still get to do things on her turn, but her turn doesn't stand out in any way.  She doesn't get the social spotlight of rolling ++++ on a crucial roll.  This is fair in a game theory sense that her results depend on her personal performance, but in a social sense we often consider things fair if they spread stuff around regardless of skill.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408474/#Comment_408474" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T08:33:12+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  8:33AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2013 1:26PM by catty_big.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about this one? A character has a high agility stat, plus grappling etc., so when they go to climb a wall they roll against their AGI plus grappling mod. Or a fighter with a high melee stat plus proficiency with handguns such that when he shoots at a weaker character, especially one that doesn't have dodge or stealth or whatever he's extremely likely to succeed. I've had several conversations with 'every roll must mean something' folks who maintain that in the above examples it's unnecessary to roll, whereas I contend that the roll mimics the randomness of real life, as follows: in the first example, the climber could have unwittingly stepped on a loose brick that puts him off balance and he falls. In the second exapmle the fighter might shoot, and at point blank range, but the gun jams. Obviously, in both these examples the bar to succeeding would be extremely low, but there's still a chance they'll fail.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408507/#Comment_408507" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T13:06:55+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  1:06PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I was totally ready to talk about this stuff HALF A YEAR AGO, as evidenced by my huge post that ended the thread at the time.<br/><br/>Now I have to go back and do research, to figure out what this all was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408510/#Comment_408510" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T13:32:33+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  1:32PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Man, I was totally ready to talk about this stuff HALF A YEAR AGO, as evidenced by my huge post that ended the thread at the time.<br/><br/>Now I have to go back and do research, to figure out what this all was.</blockquote>\nWell, you might have a slightly different take on the topic six months on.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408532/#Comment_408532" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T17:24:47+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  5:24PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now suppose that the only results were this-or-that rolls where every result is equally interesting.
