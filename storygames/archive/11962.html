It was in a fertile valley and there was no obvious reason for them to build that way. It was clearly not defensive - they were not trying to hide from some enemy. The cultural complex to which this city is attached places no ritual significance on the subterranean - other cities in nearby areas are above ground, and also in ruins.<br/><br/>My guess is that they dug in to avoid some unstoppable, deadly force that regularly swept through the valley and would have killed them had they been above ground when it came, but I can't figure out what that deadly force was. <br/><br/>Swarms of carnivorous bats?

The creatures who built it were peculiar organisms, in that each of them had the ability to return to life after physically "dying." But in reborn form, their pheremonal emissions were toxic to those who had not undergone the so-called "first death," and so their two societies lived in parallel, one above and one below the earth. Surface dwellers were sternly prohibited from ever traveling underground to visit regenerated family members or loved ones. <br/><br/>Probably it was some major transgression of this painful taboo that ended up wiping out both populations. This is just the sort of thing that kills off all great civilizations, after all. The Romans were doomed by their addiction to conquest, the British by their faith in an incompetent, inbred aristocracy, and Americans by their carelessness with money. These folks must at a certain point just have decided to "let go" in a similar way, and indulged their nostalgia for the company of the departed in spite of the terrible cost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267449/#Comment_267449" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T09:34:12+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  9:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2010 9:35AM by Mcdaldno.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>Look around the area - up and down the valley - for heavy tread marks and densely-packed earth.<br/>If you see these two signs, and at this point I'd bet you will, the answer is simple.<br/><br/>This village was part of the expanding May'der empire, famous for their large Ball-Rolling Siege Weaponry (at the time, commonly referred to as Ball-Dragons).<br/><br/>Whenever the May'der were gearing up for a new expansionist campaign, they would construct a host of Ball-Dragons in communities with sufficient resources (timber and ore), and then roll them through valleys and flat land to a more outlying township, in preparation for a big siege.<br/><br/>Your underground city was made to accommodate the fact that periodically, friendly siege equipment would come rolling through the narrow valley in which it was built.<br/><br/>The May'der are, to the best of my knowledge, the only pre-industrial society to transport siege weaponry over long distances after constructing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267453/#Comment_267453" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T09:45:43+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  9:45AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>When the Black Orcs of ShamDar rallied with the Slitherlies of the Dark Sea, the good peoples of the land faced the possibility of extinction. This "Dark Coalition" marched on the good peoples, threatening to crush them one by one.<br/><br/>The good peoples (those noble elves, dwarves, humans, gnomes, halflings and Cheetain) needed to band together and fight as one, to act in harmony against a united enemy. But historical animosities and cultural differences prevented this.<br/><br/>It was in this period of chaos and animosity that the charismatic Jailer Smith rose up, declaring the need for "one nation, of all good peoples, bereft of difference and division". Any distrust of Smith's ideals was squashed by the inevitable need to stand by him, as the Black Orcs and Slitherlies gained more followers (the Crow Folk from the East, and the Kobolds of the Sinpin Mountains). Eventually, all of the good peoples came into Smith's newly-formed Bastion Empire, or died in isolation as their enemies encroached.<br/><br/>Smith's first moves were to eradicate physical indicators of cultural difference, to assimilate everyone into a single Bastion culture. Mithril and Heart-Jewel were banned. The great Tapestries of Ancestry were burned. Smoke-Machines were retired once they'd served their part in the war. Everyone was expected to sacrifice in the name of sameness. Everyone did it because they needed to.<br/><br/>When the Dark Coalition had retreated, the Bastion Empire remained. Smith continued to purge differences and histories from his people, in whatever way he could. His goal was a single, hybridized nation, one accessible by all in equal stride. His support began to dwindle as people realized they would never retrieve their past identities, but still Smith continued.<br/><br/><b>And so, Jason, in short:</b><br/><br/>The reason that this town is underground and nearby, extremely-similar towns aren't... is because one belonged to gnomes, and the others to terranean races, perhaps humans or Cheetain. The assumptions you made about sameness and commonality between these towns serves testament to the wide effects of Smith's rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267466/#Comment_267466" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T10:30:14+00:00" title="April 16, 2010 10:30AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once again we have to suffer through the half-baked theories of the May'der Ball-Dragon enthusiasts.<br/><br/>1) The written artifacts that stand as the theoretical basis for this assertion are necessarily ambiguous.

You can hide from light or sight in windowless buildings.  You can avoid occasional events by retreating to the equivalent of storm cellars.

These leads me to a few conclusions:<ol><li>Whatever the problem was, it would not show up without at least some warning (otherwise, no one would live in the valley);</li>\n<li>The problem would be capable of either destroying/damaging above ground buildings or killing/harming any inhabitants even if "safely" inside;</li>\n<li>The problem had to be fairly localized, or all cities of this culture would look like this.</li></ol>\nWell, what sorts of possibilities does that leave us?  Lots!<ol><li>Things that only happen at night, such as the valley being hunted at night by Night Gaunt-like creatures that are unable to touch the earth, less they lose all strength;</li>\n<li>Things that only happen in the day (although standard humans aren't so good at living nocturnally without a fair bit of technology), like Yeti coming down from the hills to forage;</li>\n<li>Things that only happen in certain seasons, like migration of rock giants -- big, slow, destroying anything in their path, but not that interested in humans;</li>\n<li>Things that happen only in certain weather, like tornadoes or lightning storms;</li>\n<li>Unreal things, such as a belief that if you sleep in anywhere in the valley above ground, or in a house that's even partially above ground, the Griks will steal your soul.  Anyone found sleeping in those conditions is assumed to be soulless and killed instantly.  Or maybe it's real.</li></ol>\nOne big questions is: what's in this valley that's so valuable that it's worth putting up with whatever makes it necessary to live underground?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267525/#Comment_267525" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T14:20:06+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  2:20PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite><br/>One big questions is: what's in this valley that's so valuable that it's worth putting up with whatever makes it necessary to live underground?</blockquote>\nThe right of passage, seeing as steep mountain ranges and treacherous conditions lie to either side of the valley.<br/>Put differently, the tariffs one could charge for those passing through the valley.<br/><br/><br/>So maybe: in the winter, avalanches bury the city.<br/>In the spring, the snow melts off.<br/>In the summer, people travel through and the inhabitants charge them a fee for passage.<br/>When people attempt to "liberate" the valley, it is easily defensible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267533/#Comment_267533" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T14:48:01+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  2:48PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As part of the new regime's austerity plan, a massive archaeologic dig was shut down  roofed over for housing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267536/#Comment_267536" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T15:22:59+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  3:22PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>As part of the new regime's austerity plan, a massive archaeologic dig was shut down  roofed over for housing.</blockquote>\nAWESOME!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
