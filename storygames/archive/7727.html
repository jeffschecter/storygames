A round or oval table that everyone can sit close to is preferred.  If possible, lower the lights and find a candle or two. <br/><br/>The oldest person at the table will be the medium.  They can act as a serious professional, or just someone who read about it in a book.  Whatever sounds interesting to them will work.<br/><br/>Once you all sit down at the table, the medium will call out the name of the deceased they are contacting and invite them to commune with the living at the table.  <br/><br/>Go around the table clockwise, with each person saying who their character is and how they are related to the deceased.  Talk about it in the first person, as in "Thomas, it's your wife Thora here and I miss you terribly." <br/><br/>Preferably the characters should be family members or close friends.  It is okay if not all of the characters believe in the seance or even if they all get along.  In fact, not getting along can add to the fun. Let yourselves go and play in the moment.<br/><br/>Next everyone will put both of their hands under the table, being careful not to touch others.  <br/><br/>The medium will prep the others by suggesting possible lines of questioning or providing prompts.  Pay attention to who the characters are and try to incorporate what has been said already.  One of the others will directly ask a question to the deceased.  When a question is asked, everyone should close their eyes until that question has been answered.<br/><br/>Eventually, someone other than the person who asked the question will knock under the table.  Once for "Yes"; twice for "No".  The medium alone will decide if there was a clear answer or if the answer was inconclusive.  Then everyone will open their eyes again and the questioning continues.<br/><br/>When there are four clear knocks in a row in response to a question, the deceased is going away again and the medium will announce that there is time for only one final question.  Who gets to ask it?<br/><br/>This isn't a solemn ceremony, so keep the mood light and don't be afraid to laugh if something funny happens.<br/><br/>After the game is over, talk about it with your friends.  What did you enjoy?  What didn't you like?  Did it happen like you expected?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171618/#Comment_171618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T20:58:52+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  8:58PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played this at HarperCon 08 last month and had a lot of fun with it.
