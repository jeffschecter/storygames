The few sessions we played showed that I could have a lot of fun by playing one of those dicy games, straight out of the box and the fun was really in what was prescribed by the game. I have had a huge amount of fun, clearly more than with Paranoia playing games as Orpheus and Fading Suns. But then, we really played Paranoia. When we have heaps of fun with Orpheus and FS we basically meet and have a lot of really engaging fantasies around themes which happens to be found in books with those specific names on the covers.<br/><br/>Paranoia is, in spite of the rather large book, very narrow in scope and I would never play it every week, that would get really tiresome.<br/><br/>But.

What exactly <i>was </i>your Paranoia XP experience other than fun?<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed is that Paranoia is often thought of as that "zany pseudo-RPG", "thinly disguised GM tyranny" or "silly puns and random character killing". Which is of course a legitimate way of playing Paranoia, but sadly requires you to drop a great deal of what makes Paranoia a great game. <br/><br/>I like to think of Paranoia as a spiritual predecessor to Shab-al-Hiri Roach. (Or maybe Roach is the less formal version of Paranoia.) If your experience was all about mostly inept political manoeuvering, shifting blame, acting like utter bastards under a veil of civilty and sweating blood as you try to stay afloat (or alive), then our Paranoia games have been similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106609/#Comment_106609" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T18:13:01+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  6:13PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>If your experience was all about mostly inept political manoeuvering, shifting blame, acting like utter bastards under a veil of civilty and sweating blood as you try to stay afloat (or alive), then our Paranoia games have been similar.</blockquote>\nYes! <i>Blackadder</i> on really f'd-up drugs.

It was a lot of fun (although I developed a most un-paranoiac attachment to my PC, which added a tinge of desperation to the political manouvering).  My one frustration was with the sheer volume of secret communication, which often slowed the game to a crawl, even with most of the players using IM to communicate via laptops rather than conventional note-passing.      Is there a way to have good paranoia without the secrecy?  If not, then that might just be a major sticking point for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106930/#Comment_106930" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T03:23:14+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  3:23AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>With the "sharp and sinister GM thing": I think it's important to understand* that that's all prescribed by the rules.

But in other trad games, like WoD there are other such rules in the system, but it seems like they seldom lead to anything really useful. Probably because they are incoherent.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>I'm not sure what you mean.

The reason for the fun was the flow of the game and feeling of there always being a tangent for me to follow. This feeling of constant tangent, and of being at every moment engaged in the game I otherwise mostly get in friform games (and when I se friform I mean Jeep form or something rather close to it) and in some larps (if they are really good). (For example I felt this yesterday, when I for the first time in two years GM:ed a friform game. Amazing fun. AP in a day or two.) In friform games, though I can reach this about clearly more serious issues than in Paranoia. We create really fun/good and improvised stories in Paranoia, but there aren't really any interesting issues.<br/><br/>The question I originally tried to formulate was if it was just a coincident that it happened with Paranoia rather than with another game. Based on Graham's answer I would say that probably it wasn't a coincidence. Probably it is just a good game that fits me. I will read the book. (Yesterday I moved temporarily to the city where my old GM lives, so I can probably borrow his book.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_107348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/107348/#Comment_107348" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-08T06:12:04+00:00" title="November  8, 2007  6:12AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sven</cite><br/>I havne't read the book, but I had also realized that the GM manipulation it was part a part of the system. </blockquote>\nIt might just be me, but I'm a little wary of calling what a GM does in Paranoia 'manipulation'. Mostly because it reads to me as if there is something cagey, dishonest and malicious about it. I don't think that's true. Sure, the Alpha Complex is a twisted, dark and insane place. The higher-ranking NPCs are often conniving, two-faced scumbags. The player characters are regularly - if not constantly - in the dark about things and have to act on false, incomplete or incoherent information. <br/><br/>But the players should <i>know </i> all this. They should be aware of it. That's what makes Paranoia fun and funny. They don't need to know what is actually going on, but as a fellow player at the gametable the GM should be open when there's obviously something that the characters need to know, but aren't allowed to. The GM advice in the rulebook recommends clearly switching between Alpha Complex and GM personas for that reason. <br/><br/>GMing Paranoia isn't about pulling a fast one on the players, but about the Alpha Complex playing a trick on the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
