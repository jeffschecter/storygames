Its supposed to be a comedy game, but I haven't had a chance to read it.<br/>\n<br/>\n  What should I know about this game?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any tips/tricks for playing?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Any tips/tricks for GMing (that I can pass on to them)?<br/>\nDave M                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180074/#Comment_180074" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T13:25:31+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  1:25PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2008 1:31PM by John_Powell.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The system is called Cortex and is also used for the other licensed Margaret Weiss RPGs, Serenity and Battlestar Galactica. Like Savage Worlds the system rates stats and skills by die type (d2 to d12, then continuing with d12+d2 to d12). Unlike Savage Worlds, in Cortex you roll both your stat and skill dice together and add them to meet or beat a target number or opposing roll. Plot points can be used to increase die type rolled before rolling, or to add 1 point apiece to a result after rolling. Plot points are also used to power certain character abilities, and to add small details to the story. Plot points are gained by playing up your character's flaws or drawbacks. There are separate tracks for wounds and stun damage, but they are equal and laid out next to each other. One is marked off from one side while the other is marked off from the other. You are knocked out when you take an amount of stun equal or greater than your total stun minus the number of wounds taken, a mechanic I quite like.<br/><br/>Overall I dislike the system because it feels to me that, no matter what you have on your character sheet, when you have plot points you can do what you need to do, and when you don't you can't. <i>Edit - This can probably be fixed by changing the difficulty ladder from 3,7,11,15, etc. to 3,6,9,12,etc. but I haven't tried it.</i><br/><br/>Your mileage may vary - lots of people love this system, as a trip around various rpg forums will attest.<br/><br/>My tips for GMing this game:<br/>1. Do not make people roll for minor actions or when failing is uninteresting.<br/>2. Take every opportunity to award plot points.<br/>3. Consider having the players pool their plot points together, and only spend them by consensus. We did this with hero points in a Mutants and Masterminds game I played in, and it was really cool in getting players to act as a team and help each other's characters be awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180165/#Comment_180165" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T21:38:22+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  9:38PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/>\n  Thanks, this will be the first time she ever GM'd any advice, think we will have fun?<br/>\n  My gut feeling is, it will be OK, as long as she doesn't get too self conscious, you know?

Tom is finishing his game and he has at least a month's more stuff to do. And them I am going to run about 10 sessions of TSoY.
