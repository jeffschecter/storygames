In Microscope, the player group collectively builds a gameworld, and then acts out scenes in that world, within a number of constraints. I was wondering if it were possible to do the same thing with a single character, i.e. build up a character by acting out scenes from that person's life, and gradually filling in sections of the character sheet like age, occupation, vices and virtues, ambitions and flaws etc.<br/><br/>The premise is that we're all walking down a quiet, residential suburban street, and we see a house from which the occupant is obviously in the process of moving, or more likely has already moved, because there is a skip outside, in which can be found various personal objects such as a computer screen, a sofa, some clothes, maybe a picture or two, etc. <br/><br/>In the first stage in the game a sheet of paper passes round the player group 3-4 times, and on their turn each player writes on the sheet an object such as the ones mentioned above. They also write next to the name of the object either +, - or +/-, to indicate whether it represents a positive period or event, a negative one, or a mixture. If they like they can also write ++ or - -, to indicate that the period or event in question is either very positive or very negative, but don\u2019t write anything at this point about what kind of event it is.<br/><br/>In stage two, the sheet passes round again, and this time each player decides on a location, how old the character was, and what connects the character to the object; forex, if it was the computer screen, it could have been given to him/her by his/her parents as a present on graduating from University. If the computer had a \u2013 by it, it could have been the occasion  for a family row, perhaps because the parents bought a computer that was unsuitable, and it emphasised the generational technology gap between them. If it had a + by it, it could be a scene of jubilation on him/her graduating; there could be a party either at the family house or at the character\u2019s first house-share; if +/- it could be bitter-sweet: joy at the character\u2019s graduating, but sadness at the fact that they\u2019re finally leaving home for good. Etc. <br/><br/>The same thing happens for each of the objects mentioned, and after the event has been decided upon, as in Microscope, the players come up with a scene, decide on what characters should be in that scene, and roleplay them. Following this they try to fill in some specific sections of the character sheet. <br/><br/>After a few scenes the player group stops and talks about the character, and tries to formulate some more general observations about him/her (by which time they\u2019ve probably decided on age and gender, but not necessarily- it will be up to the player group when to decide to fill in on any of the fields on the character sheet). At this point the facilitator should encourage the players to decide how they feel about their character, i.e. is he/she a nice person, a bit chauvinistic, bad-tempered, lonely or self-effacing etc.? Are they ambitious, generally successful in life, or is there something that has always held them back? And so on. <br/><br/>When the players have filled in as much as they can on the character sheet, they should try to come up with a reason why the person is moving (it is hoped that by this point they will have established whether the house is single-occupancy, shared with a life partner or is a house share). Also, is <i>this </i>event positive, negative or neutral? If negative, the character could have got divorced, and is moving out (perhaps into a bedsit?) of the couple\u2019s erstwhile shared home. If positive, they could have got a promotion, and are moving to be nearer to their new job, and if +/-, the above could still be true, but in moving they are having to break their family ties or their friendship circle.<br/><br/>If folks are interested in playing this, I\u2019ll get to work on a \u2018character sheet\u2019, and will endeavour to formulate the above into an intelligible set of rules <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420610/#Comment_420610" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T08:44:01+00:00" title="August 23, 2013  8:44AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2013 1:41PM by catty_big.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/SkipJack.pdf" rel="nofollow">Playtest draft</a> now available.

I hadn't thought about using the system as a generic character gen tool. And the idea of extending the valency system to include lost, stolen or abandoned objects- terrific! I'm not quite sure whether to include that in the Valencies/List of objects fields, or just mention it in the scene-creation advice- let me mull that one- but yeah, thanks for identifying that. This is the thing with having an open design process, folks often come up with cool stuff that even the designer didn't think of.<br/><br/>Re: the font size: I take your point. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/Bodoni%2012%20pt.pdf" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the point size taken down a notch (on all the text, including the headers), and <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/Bodoni%2011%20pt.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> is it taken down one step further.

During the game, players take turns to pick an object, establish its relevance to the Character, and create a scene to illustrate this. The group then decides what other characters feature in the scene, apportion roles and roleplay that scene (in a similar way to the scenes in Microscope), after which they see what, if anything, they've learnt about the Character. All of which I think should work fine, except... who rolepelays the Character (i.e. the one that the whole game is about, and that is 'created' during it)? Should players take turns to play him/her, or should they be always in the background, talked about but not spoken to directly? Thoughts anyone?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
