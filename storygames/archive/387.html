                    Hello Story Games peeps.<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting a new series of threads called Game Sketch. They're a place for some low-pressure exercise of your creative muscles.<br/>
<br/>
The general idea is this:<br/>
- I post three images from my library of cool images.<br/>
- You choose an image and respond with:<br/>
-- A game title<br/>
-- A very short description of the game (like, 100 words or so).<br/>
-- You can also add: "What the players do" and "What the characters do" if you want.<br/>
-- A little snippet of a mechanic or reward system or trait name or some stuff that ties in to the image and your game idea.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it as a finger-painting activity for game designers. Just noodle around. Post as little as you want. Comment on other ideas, etc. I figure someone will go charging off into a full-blown game design, but that's really not the point here. Yes, it's okay to post ideas for all three images.<br/>
<br/>
I'll probably do a new one every week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Next: The first images!                </div>

Restless Dreams<br>
<br>
Man takes his first steps out into the endless black, only to find what he suspected all along is true. Nothing which dies ever really passes away, and the star-winds howl through countless, endless forgotten charnel houses. The first colony ship, the one shining dream of mankind is cut off from Earth, wandering without God's light in the silent abyss. Is there any way to return home, or will the phantoms of the dead universe reap yet more souls into their rotting bellies.<br>
<br>
To lose one's self...<br>
To lose one's soul...<br>
<br>
The hungry universe yawns wide to swallow everything.<br/>
<br/>
What the characterss do: Each player portrays one member of the Expeditionary Force, the individuals chosen from within the ship's populating to be the ones to face the outside world. Each character is tied to 100 souls on board the ship, and the fate of that character will be reflected in their charges. The players must stick together to overcome the strange world they have been awakened to, ultimately determining the fate of the Earth with their actions. They must also monitor their own ranks for corruption and madness, and face the choice of wether to excise the portions that become tainted, or risk infection of the entire ship in order to avoid losing the strength to face future challenges.<br/>
<br/>
What the players do: Build their Expeditionary Force from a shared pool of stat points, skillfully guide their character's through the challenges of the Journey back to Earth, safeguard their share of the colonists from madness and death by distributing attrittion between their own individual character and the faceless masses that they are tied to. The prize for the "winning" player? Final narrattion rights on the return home. How does the final situation on the ship shake out? Who lives, dies, or loses their soul? What happens to the Earth?<br/>
<br/>
Mechanic Tie-in: The most important mechanical bit would be Attrition. The consequences of danger and damage to the characters have to go somewhere, and in this game, that somewhere isn't always the individual. When things go bad, someone gets hurt. It is up to the player to decide if their own character takes on that burden (bringing them closer to madness and being taken out of the Force at the hands of their own compatriots) or if they put the consequences on their share, ultimately affecting the fate of mankind itself.<br/>
<br/>
There we go. ^.^ That was fun and inspiring. Excellent pics. *grins*                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

The Watchers<br/>
<br/>
The world is filled with evil and imperfection.  The old ways lie forgotten, traditional values are considered useless.  There are those who still try to live by purity and honor.  There are those who care nothing for righeousness and crush the world with their sins.<br/>
<br/>
And there are those who watch.<br/>
<br/>
Bestial, silent, and malevolent, they watch until the time is right.<br/>
<br/>
What the characters do:  Players control land wights, spirits, local gods, and any other ancient and morally questionable religious entity.  These creatures watch as morally reprehensible (from their perspective) acts are committed.  Slowly, they reveal temselves and deal with the situation.<br/>
<br/>
What the players do:  Make statements on morality and human self-centeredness through characters that operate on unconventional (and player-determined) moral codes.  It'd probably end up ripping off Dogs quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical Thingie:  Creepy.  Players start with a certain amout of creepy.  Creepy points are lost (sometimes intentionally) as the NPCs being watched figure out whats going on.  The Watcher makes their judgement and takes action when they run out of Creepy.<br/>
<br/>
Norse color with Taoist overtones (sort of).  I've never read any Swamp Thing, but it might be something like that.                        </div>

                            1C + 1A<br/><br/>The spirits are alive -- in you.  Coyote or Raven, Turtle or Owl, the ancient ones are awakening again among the souls of humanity.  Why do they rise after centuries of slumber?  What purpose do their strange powers and even stranger compulsions have?  What is the <em>thing</em> that is coming that the reawakened spirits cannot remember and yet dread all the same?<br/><br/>What the characters do: learn to live with being inhabited by an ancient animal spirit, learn about the origin and nature of their "inheritance," and prevent the <em>things</em> from taking over the world.<br/><br/>What the players do: earn credibility points by following the dangerous compulsions of their spirit-riders, ask questions about the spiritual nature of the universe, and spend credibility points to answer each other's questions.                        </div>

                            Foxmask Tricks Astronaut and Suicide Girl<br/>
<br/>
GM playes "Foxmask" who attempts to trick sweet, sweet heroine "Astronaut" (young and naive, but also full of heart) a prevent her from being the first Native American in space using a homemade rocket fueled by faith. Soon her transmissions attempting to get out of the atmosphere are picked up by mentally ill "Suicide Girl" (another PC) who stands on buildings in hopes of picking up radio signals on her braces.<br/>
<br/>
She succeeds and helps Astronaut break through the illusions cast by Foxmask.... an anchient trickster from Native American folklore... and out of the atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
After that, it starts to get a little weird. More characters pop up: Mama Moon (both literal moon and huge goddess form) Klack (The spirit of a native american hunter covered in the clacking star-light-filled antlers of celestial deer), The Great Bird of Death (a great bird that might.... you know... represent death)....VoidCog (a god representing the nessesity of emptyness, entropy and death- a sort of second death figure-- but this one is actually likeable)<br/>
<br/>
A white man's take on visions quests mixed with Alan Moore comics weirdness.<br/>
<br/>
Characters would attempt to survive and reach their self-set goals despite a number of threats that would also illuminate them on a sort of spiritual path of their own based on character creation quetions about what they want in life. In game goals could be effected by real life goals being brought up, discussed and achieved or attempted in some way. The game could be set up to build metaphores that might be useful in a persons real life.                        </div>

                            Great stuff so far! It's interesting to see the similarities across the ideas. And the mechanical snippets are very cool, too.<br/>
<br/>
I have an idea for each pic. Here's the first one.
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
Image 1A<br/>
<br/>
<b>Foxglove</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Put the blossoms on your toes,<br/>
Catch your prey and slip your foes,<br/>
Quickly quickly we shall go,<br/>
To the house of Yes and No</i><br/>
<br/>
The faeries have come back to the Forest, and the world is upside down. The Fox, the Hunter, the Woodcutter's Daughter, The Hare, the Owl -- they can no longer trust the natural order of things. The faeries play with life like the spider does the fly. Do you dare to treat with creatures so sly and deadly? Do you dare ignore them? One thing is certain, the Forest will never be the same.<br/>
<br/>
The players take on the roles of the denizens of the Forest; humans and beasts alike. Each must struggle to win their Heart's desire, which the Fey are willing to offer up on a silver platter -- with a catch. The GM plays the faeries, pitting characters against one another by offering horrific bargains to give them what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanic thingie: Trait gambling. The game is mostly about transformation -- how nothing stays the same. So the main mechanic would involve risking character traits and relationships whenever you're in conflict. You would never end a conflict with the same trait list that you started with. Even central, definitional traits like "Fox" could be lost or traded -- the fox becomes the man and vice versa. All the gambling and trait swapping would drive conflicts that get the characters closer to their Heart's Desire. But by the time they get it, will they be the same people anymore?<br/>

                            I was thinking that you never lose traits so much as trade. So, the GM might put up a trait that you want (like "Invisible" as part of a faerie deal) and then you have to ante up a trait. Then we roll dice and find out who comes out ahead in the conflict. The winner can maybe use successes to move up or down on your trait list and choose something else for you to trade. So maybe you ante up "Brave" but then you lose by a lot so you have to actually give up "Girl." Or instead of "Invisible", I give you "Cruel."<br/>

I'm not sure if that really works, but that's the very very sketchy version.                        </div>

Wachowski is Dead<br>
<br>
For some reason, fuckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trenchcoat badasses have to kill each other on rooftops using two pistols at once while they think about the true nature of whatever (and be deep). For justice. Determine what exactly is supposed to be going on by combining your Plot Tokens with the currently revealed Stoned Philosophy.<br>
<br>
Players create said badasses by throwing a dart at an open dictionary until they hit a noun, which is then capitalized along with its definite article and becomes the character's title. It is up to the player to interpret the results in terms of the war against realityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true masters, art-fag revenge fantasy, or anime gunslingers. <br>
<br>
Mechanic: Otherkind style 4d6 roll every time somebody slaps leather.<br>
<br>
Black d6: Bullets. What are bullets hitting? 1-2: your character. 3: the scenery. 4: an army of goons. 5: important machinery. 6: something explodey.<br>
<br>
Grey d6: Stoned Philosophy. What world altering revelation comes up during the firefight? 1: being shot is total bullshit to a true karate motherfucker. 2: despite your prodigious capacity for combat, violence never really solves anything; except perhaps in the case of your truly evil arch-nemesis. 3: somebodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manufacturing everything you believe to be true in order to control you. 4: something about the HeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Journey (break out your copy of Occidental Mythology). 5: everything in the world has subtly changed, but nobody notices but you. 6: just total fucking psychotic breakdown.<br>
<br>
White d6: Clothes. WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s looking good? 1-2: the bad guys. 3: lots of bystanders. 4: the good guys. 5-6: your character.<br>
<br>
Purple d6: Plot Token. Once you collect all six you can trade them in for the denouncement and win (but tragically)! Should be related somehow to your current Stoned Philosophy. Plot Token 6 comes with free deus ex machina.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Argh, the things I come up with when sleep-deprived...<br>
<br/>

<br/>
Title: I Sold My Soul for $40 + tax<br/>
<br/>
Pitch: Vaguely inspired by "kill puppies for satan", but with more standing on buildings and stupid stunts.  Players take the roles of losers who sold their souls for exactly $40 plus tax (tax amount may vary from location to location, check your local chamber of commerce for details). They've just realized that maybe they got the short end of the stick. Now they're trying to get their souls back with just 40 bucks each.<br/>
<br/>
Players have limited resources--the 40 bucks, plus tax if they managed to hold onto it. When that runs out, their souls get collected. But they're *magic* 40 bucks (don't ask me how). If they can find the demons they sold their souls to, and return the $40 + tax, they'll get their souls back. Of course, the demons don't exactly want to give the souls back...<br/>
<br/>
Character Creation Highlights:<br/>
<br/>
Answer the following:<br/>
1) What did your character need exactly $40 + tax for?<br/>
<br/>
2) What bills and coins did you get the $40 + tax in?<br/>
<br/>
3) some junk about relationships and stuff<br/>
<br/>
Vague Resolution Ideas:<br/>
<br/>
Bigger bills and coins can get used for bigger stunts. If you want to use them for something smaller, you either need to waste the extra or find someone to give you magical change. Several smaller bills can't be used for bigger stunts, but again, if you can find someone to give you magical change, you can turn the small bills into a big one--minus the exchange fees.<br/>
<br/>
Goody-two-shoes version: If the PCs spend all of the $40 + tax on good deeds their souls will be saved or something. But if even a little is used for selfishness, too bad. It's like shooting the moon in Hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Edit: I imagine the Hearts-ish thing is important. There should be lots of swindling and in-fighting between the players as they try to collect what's missing from their $40 + tax from the other players. I bet you could even do it GM-less.                        </br></div>
