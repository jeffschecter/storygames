A really, really sketchy compendium class.<br/><br/><b>DRUNKEN MASTER</b><br/>When you wake up after a bender with no idea where you are or how you got there, the next time you level up you may choose this move:<br/><br/><b>\u2610 Where Has the Rum Gone?</b><br/>You start with 0-drunkenness. When you regard a cache or store of alcohol, ask the GM how many coins it\u2019s worth; she\u2019ll tell you. When you knock back a few rounds of stiff drinks, roll+(the number of coin spent on liquor divided by ten). On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7\u20139, choose 2:<br/>\u2022 You get 3-drunkenness. (You can choose this multiple times, you wino.)<br/>\u2022 You don\u2019t immediately fall asleep for a problematic duration.<br/>\u2022 You don\u2019t get in trouble with the authorities for public intoxication.<br/>On a miss, choose 1 anyway, but take (your damage die, AP forceful messy) today, and (your damage die, AP forceful messy) again tomorrow, for alcohol poisoning.<br/>You may spend 1-drunkenness to get +1-ongoing to a single basic move; spend another 1-drunkenness to change it.<br/><br/>If you have the move Where Has the Rum Gone?, these count as class moves for you; you can choose from them when you level up:<br/><br/><b>\u2610 Alcoholic Anonymous</b><br/>Spend 1-drunkenness to blend in automatically with a big crowd that\u2019s drinking and partying. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re supposed to be there and treat you like one of them, although you may have to Defy Danger if you\u2019re, for example, a dwarf trying to hide amongst trolls.<br/><br/><b>\u2610 Coyote Ugly</b><br/>When you drunkenly hook up with someone without even finding out their name, heal all your hit points and cure one debility. If you bothered to find out their name, you get +1 forward against them. If they disgust you or you disgust yourself, they can choose to reduce your drunkenness to zero.<br/><br/><b>\u2610 Drunk Hulk</b><br/>When you successfully Defy Danger, spend 1-drunkenness to pick an additional effect from the Defend list.<br/><br/><b>\u2610 In Vino Veritas</b><br/>When you seek insight in drink, roll+CHA. On a successful roll, the liquor answers your questions and shows you visions. On a 10+, choose two: the visions are lucid and detailed; the visions show you what you must do, and you carry 1 forward to doing it; the visions cure you, healing (your damage die) hit points.<br/>\u2022 On a 7-9, choose one: the visions are confusing and alarming; the visions are lucid and detailed but they leave you stunned.<br/><br/>Also, your adventuring party gets this move \u2026<br/><br/><b>\u2610 Intervention!</b><br/>When you confront your friend en masse and by surprise about their problem and they can\u2019t get away, roll +CHA -their current drunkenness. On a 10+ you hold 2. On a 7-9 they hold 1, you hold 1. You and they can spend hold 1 for 1 on the following:<br/>\u2022 They admit their life has become unmanageable: their next move can\u2019t come from the Drunken Master list<br/>\u2022 They commit themself to a higher power: they gain a cleric or paladin move (choice of which goes to whoever didn\u2019t spend hold on this)<br/>\u2022 They ask a higher power to remove their shortcomings: they replace one of their Drunken Master moves, their choice, with a move from their regular class sheet, your choice<br/>\u2022 They make direct amends to a person they had harmed: they gain +1-forward to aid that person<br/>These effects last until the next time they take a drink. On a miss, they don\u2019t have a problem, they can quit anytime they want to\u2014they immediately gain +3-drunkenness.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410658/#Comment_410658" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T22:44:39+00:00" title="March 27, 2013 10:44PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2013 10:44PM by Deliverator.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my brain.<br/><br/>Edit: My poor, poor brain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
