I'm sort of, kind of in charge of organizing, but it's just a case of making the event and attending it. The actual Meetup (for next week) is here:<br/><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Tabletop-Roleplayers/calendar/15943738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Tabletop-Roleplayers/calendar/15943738/</a><br/><br/>And I hate that as a method, but it started as a Meetup Idea, so it has to stay there, i reckon.<br/><br/>That said... anyone got a better idea? I have a laundry list of "groups" and "meetups" and "lists" and I'm pretty sick of having to manage each one individually, every time some new event type comes along (private campaign game, regular board or RPG meetups, con planning, etc).<br/><br/>I'm ranting a bit (and in a SHIT mood today)... but GOOD DAMN, isn't the Internet supposed to be, like, an efficient communications medium? We fucked up BAD, by accepting shit like Facebook and Meetup, when email, listserv, and Usenet used to cover EVERY possible communications scenario:<br/>* Individual<br/>* Private group<br/>* Public discussion/promotion<br/>* Focusable by region, subject, region+subject, etc.<br/><br/>Now... it's a God damned sea of sandboxes, event planning tools, four or five MAJOR competing groupware services, forums (forums, forums, FUCKING forums!!!) and on and on and on....<br/><br/>It's a pain in the ass to plan and promote an event for a specific subject and region, anymore. Nationally (globally)? SURE! Completely privately? TRIVIAL! But targeted and public... it's a jungle of walled gardens. I HATE the 21st Century Internet with a growing (almost insane) passion!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307919/#Comment_307919" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T12:40:19+00:00" title="January 12, 2011 12:40PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the links.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307964/#Comment_307964" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T19:29:53+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  7:29PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noticed similar issues, but thanks for going to the effort in the face of maddening, luddite-inspiring competing venues for communication/organization.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308033/#Comment_308033" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-13T11:10:52+00:00" title="January 13, 2011 11:10AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Made a Google Calendar, for centralizing the events (e.g. if we have to change week, day, time, or location going forward).

Six attendees on the first event is more than I expected, for sure. And so far, it's players with some serious creative chops and solid game experience--perfect for promoting the event to lookers-on and the curious.<br/>-----<br/>Jason, I have three different ways to get the word out, and at least two ways to RSVP--what else should I do?<br/>* The RTR Meetup groups, which is basically the main 'hub" for planning and RSVPing.<br/>* The Google Calendar, which is easiest to add to (most folks') scheduling applications, and which supports RSVPing (with a Google Account).<br/>* Notification of the above here at at Facebook, though having to re-make the posts/FB Events every time drives me away from them as primary channels.<br/><br/>I could go ape-shit cross-promoting it all over other groups (like Durham gamers Yahoo Group and Nerd RDU), but most of those channels of which I'm aware are all-but-dead--Facebook has killed them, for the time being (until folks realize that FB is a walled garden, compared to YGroups or GGroups). And for the general goal of promoting indie published games to folks who won't automatically push back because it's not d20... how do I find them folks using gaming-focused groups? Maybe I need to find some kind of "Do Whatever in the Triangle" Meetup, to promote it the event more broadly?<br/><br/>Also, ultimately, this kind of event relies a LOT of participant word-of-mouth. if everyone who intended to go posted to three other locations than those I posted to, we'd have a HUGE net cast for attendees, across a broader social segment than the folks I'm likely to reach here or on FB or on any opt-in Meetup/Group.<br/>-----<br/>As for Game Theory, I have some reservations:<br/>* Thursday is BOTH Pathfinder AND Warmachine--something not clear on the GT Calendar. So you've got groups of three to six taking up 8'x8' tables (minimum).<br/>* Rob politely--but clearly--made the point that those games, with their supplement and collectible treadmill, are much better money makers for the store than any indie publication (he asserted that most retailer arrangements from indie sources end up losing the store money).<br/>* And so... the "first come, first served" policy will get us table space, in theory; but in practice, we'd be blocking out his cash cows and quickly become unwelcome.<br/><br/>So, if we're successful in promoting this "mini-con' to new players, spouses, friends, and acquaintances--I see regular attendance in the mid-teens to low-twenties as "success"--then we will quickly fill the space at GT (and, thus, wear out our welcome). I suspect we'll be looking for a venue that's happy to have any size group, doing anything, so long as beverages and snacks/meals are also consumed--a pub or coffee shop. Fortunately, regarding the latter, the RPR Meetup group has an official "sponsor" and has also recently been petitioned by another coffee shop to come use their space.<br/><br/>But then THAT becomes a barrier to entry--folks feel like every event "costs them" to use the venue's services, even if that cost is a couple of bucks for a drink and tip or a meal they'd have to eat anyway (though pricier than cooking for oneself, sure). Better still, if the venue is typically slow on that evening and, thus, any business is better than no business (as opposed to a venue that's generally packed and flipping tables like mad--they have NO use for gamers camping booths for four-hour blocks).<br/><br/>It's a tough nut to crack. Of course, if we get momentum more from Durham and Chapel Hill, then we could move to SciFiGenre, who seems to have more free space more nights than Game Theory. Further, SFG actually SELLS indie books and has a significant web store and warehousing operation, which keeps them from being utterly dependent on regular brick-and-mortar sales to stay alive--it doesn't kill them to have a table or five taken up by folks who don't buy anything that night. (I buy SOMETHING every time I use a game store, even if it's just drinks and snacks or a small item like a dice brick.)<br/><br/>I'm all ears, if folks have any kind of suggestions about anything that would make this grow to a Real Deal Event\xae. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310264/#Comment_310264" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T11:00:34+00:00" title="January 31, 2011 11:00AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to try the same format out, with Sci Fi Genre, giving them lots of notice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310284/#Comment_310284" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-31T12:01:56+00:00" title="January 31, 2011 12:01PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to do SFG as well, but it's a Raleigh group. Is there any <i>active</i>, Durham-specific group?<br/><br/>As for notice, I'm not sure that would matter, in the case of GT at least. He told me it was generally first come, first served. I suspect SFG has the same policy, unless something like a sanctioned tournament was going on, with reps and prize support, etc. PERHAPS if our numbers hit a significant average--20ish or more minimum, every meetup--then we'd be tantamount to a "tourney" and be able to give notice that is meaningful vis a vis how they schedule other things (i.e. not at all) or present our meetup on their schedule posters/site (i.e. as a Major Event).<br/><br/>But until we have those numbers--and a majority of them from Durham--then it's gotta stay in West Raleigh and we gotta try to wedge in amongst the cracks left by mini gamers (d20 and otherwise).<br/><br/>I *will*, however, be more aggressive about booting folk's backpacks and crap on unused tables. There was some kid playing WoW when i got there, whom I asked if he was holding his table. He muttered something about "this is for Magic" and kept playing until well after we'd all sat down to run games. Then got up, left his laptop and several packs on the table, and joined some mini game at another table entirely. THAT shit won't fly, if we're as crowded every week as it was last week. Not that we needed it... but I'd have preferred NOT having some guy's ass poised right behind my head all night, as he stood over his Warmachine table and talked about TV shows (the wasted table was on the wall next to the one at which you guys played).<br/>===<br/>Did I read that right? You guys ran Fiasco AND Zombie Cinema in less than three hours? Not much scenery chewing there, eh...?<br/><br/>I wish we'd had the last hour to wrap up the AW game--there were two BIG scenes left to play, I felt; one for each of our two PCs. Both got started but were left unfinished, as we experimented with fast-cutting between the two (as fast as the AW system allows!).<br/><br/>It didn't help that I got all kinds of confused about the scope of a test--everything leading up so far in past scenes had *seemed* like conflict resolution, but was *really* task resolution; so my declarations of actions were not granular enough once we got into an extended combat scene (much to Remi's frustration). I was trying to set stakes and roll for the whole enchilada when I should have been making small, discrete situational "attacks" like "kill the leader" or "take out the 50 cal." My last 'action declaration' was "KILL 'EM ALL!" Not really AW's scale of efficacy. :}<br/><br/>But I was VERY impressed with the basic system and the flavor and such-like. I could see getting into playing any one of the archetypes (whatever they're called), and I think it has real potential for long-term play (there's no inherent "story arc" control, like the number of scenes/dice in Fiasco; and there's advancement elements that seem like they'd take FAR longer than one session to accrue).

It was only "Raleigh" because Meetup doesn't recognize a city called "The Triangle". Even on the list, Eric is pushing for folks to organize Durham, Chapel Hill and Cary meetups - Which are happening regularly. The Durham group meets near Briar Creek, and Cary meets at It's A Grind. It all falls under the umbrella of "Raleigh" without splitting into sub-groups in order to maintain numbers and interest, but already the "Raleigh Roleplayers' Group" has regular meetups from Raleigh all the way to Chapel Hill, and everywhere in between.
