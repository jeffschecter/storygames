By combining vanilla AW with several ideas from MH I think I may have come up with a solid system to do just that. But perhaps you'll be the better judge?<br/><br/>I took Strings, several moves including "shut someone down" and "turn someone on", and plenty of playbook and sex moves from Monsterhearts and combined them with standard AW moves and rules. I think it reads really well and I am excited to playtest this soon.<br/><br/>I have changed "gangs" to now be "forces" and changed the sizing as follows; Diminutive 15-30 troops, Tiny 50-80 troops, Small 100-140 troops, Medium 200-250 troops, Large 400-500 troops, Huge 1000+ troops Gargantuan 2000+ troops, etc (just keep doubling numbers). I have no idea how this will work out in play, but one more thing to figure out.<br/><br/>I also changed the stat names to be a little more...generic I guess?<br/>Cool= Focus, Hard=Edge, Sharp=Sense, Hot=Grace, and Weird=Wise<br/><br/>The playbooks I have written up so far are;<br/><br/>The Lord - Hardholder type. You get a domain to customize and rule over and a garrision of hundreds of troops to defend your realm. I worry a little about giving a PC that sort of power, but it's also ALOT of responsibility too so I hope it evens out. Inspirations are Eddard Stark and Tywin Lannister<br/><br/>The Courtier - Meant to be of Noble birth, they are a master of manipulation and seduction, the Courtier has a lot of moves to support this. They have options to take a domain like a Lord. Inspirations are Cersei Lannister and Tyrion Lannister<br/><br/>The Man-at-arms - A direct and deadly warrior. Loads of weapons and moves to support killing. Simple and effective. Inspirations include Bronn and Ser Sandor Clegane<br/><br/>The Knight - A mounted warrior with a troop of warriors at his command. A Chopper parallel, the Knight has loads of effective gear, a "gang" of men from 50-100 men-at-arms to throw around. Inspirations are Jamie Lannister and Ser Gregor Clegane.<br/><br/>The Vagabond - An operative parallel. The Vagabond always has some jobs on the go and a crew of men and women to help him get it done. Versatility and freedom give the Vagabond the edge to get by. Inspirations are Jaqen H'ghar, Varys, and Jon Snow (to a lesser extent).<br/><br/>The Maester - Master healer and advisor to Lords and Ladies. The Maester is the best person to keep you alive *when* you are injured or sickly. They also have a move to poison victims for when the need arises. Inspirations are Maester Lewin and every other Maester alive. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The Player - A master of the courtly intrigures, the players move people around like chess pieces. Inspirations include Little-finger, Tyrion and Varys.<br/><br/>The Mystic - This one is a little off. I basically assembled this playbook to allow other playbooks to take a move or two from it to accommodate any supernatural abilities they might want to take. It includes things like prophecy, skinchanging, etc. I doubt I will allow this as a playable class and instead a playbook to borrow from as I said. Inspirations include Mellisandre, Bran Stark, and Jojen Reed.<br/><br/>The Artisan - An artist or craftsmen. The Artisan is all about being the common man who is uniquely skilled in his or her trade. They get a Workspace to ply their trade, some fun commoner moves and the ability to showcase their wares to impress crowds. I am a big fan of how this playbook worked out. Inspirations include Donal Noye and Gendry.<br/><br/>The Scout - Excels in the wilds where most men fail. They have a special move for boosting their moves in the wild. They are super useful to people they escort. Inspirations include to a lesser extent Osha and Arya, but also Jon Snow and most Night's Watch Rangers.<br/><br/>The Blessed - A priest and leader of the common man. The Shepherd has a group of followers who cling to his every preaching word. Rather than restrict the various priesthoods to individal playbooks I combined them all into this one. Shepherds who want more of a supernatual edge can take some moves from The Mystic to really compliment their abilities. Inspirations include any Septons we've seen, The Damphair and Mellisandre.<br/><br/>The Knight -  much like The Driver from AW, the knight gains a signifigant bonus when on horseback. A master of the knightly fighting styles, horsemanship and single combat, the Knight is all about defeating enemies in single combat. Inspirations are Ser Barristan Selmy and Jamie Lannister.<br/><br/>I would also like to thank Joe Mcdaldno and Vincent Baker for their amazing games which has directly given me the tools I've needed to make this hack. I hope they both appreciate my passion for this project and that I have their blessings in displaying it here.<br/><br/>Here is a link to my play-test documents so far. I welcome any advice, comments or constructive criticisms.

It's on the MC to use these as often as possible. Influence your life in interesting and complimated ways. You just spent the night skin-walking and come morning your animal decides to spend a String he gained to give you the condition 'exhausted'. Or, if the MC truly believes you are embracing the animal too much and too often, then the slope gets a lot more slippery. Does that make sense? Is it too arbitrary?\n<blockquote>Most important: how do i get a dragon?</blockquote>\nhahah that is a great question! I don't know yet....advice?\n<blockquote>More questions: Could an outrider take a boat too? I am thinking about the iron island raiders.

I think I will spend some time and make a Raider or Iron Islander playbook. I really enjoyed making the ones I did, so adding a few extra ones on demand doesn't bother me at the least.

Initial thoughts:<br/><br/>- Why are you keeping Hold Steady? Defy Danger functions like Act Under Fire. My take on Hold Steady was that it fulfilled the role of making Monsterhearts a horror game -- it was important to have a move dealing with you becoming terrified, fighting off fear, etc. Game of Thrones doesn't seem to have the same horror element. Or is your take that it does have the same element? Is terror something you were aiming to emphasize? <br/><br/>- Why is Turning Someone On restricted to the opposite gender? I understand that you might not want the same "you're discovering your sexuality" element as is present in Monsterhearts -- Game of Thrones isn't (entirely) about teenagers discovering themselves, after all -- but doesn't this completely ignore stuff like Loras and Renly? Maybe it should be "When you turn on someone who is attracted to your gender..." Was there another purpose behind restricting it to the opposite gender that I'm missign?<br/><br/>- I like that you made "Insight" and that Maestro D' move both peripheral, and presumably open to everyone who satisfies the conditions. Evocative, functional, and logical.<br/><br/>- I haven't gone through the playbooks in great depth, but I almost immediately want to know if these playbooks are supposed to be akin to AW playbooks in their excellence. In AW, you're THE Gunlugger. Others may lug guns, but you, as THE Gunlugger, are by far the most able to lug guns out of all those who might lug guns. The point being that you're pretty gosh darn effective and powerful. You're excellent. You're incredibly capable. So if you're an Artisan in this, are you THE Artisan? Are you a craftsman whose works are renowned throughout Westeros? If you're the Man-at-arms, are you THE Man-at-arms? The deadliest man with a sword in 50 miles? I ask this primarily because I'm trying to envision how all of these character types weave together into a single whole. In AW, the Hardholder is going to associate with the Gunlugger, the Faceless, the Brainer, the Skinner, etc., because not only are there not many people in general, but those folks are the best at what they do. They're important. In this hack, why is the Lord going to associate with the Vagabond? Why is the Lord going to associate with the Artisan? Is it because they're the best at what they do? Is it because this is a game more about Winterfell than King's Landing? <br/><br/>Good stuff here, altogether.

Not everyone is a brave hero in Westeros, when you see someone being stabbed, do you freeze up or push through that fear to intervene or run? This is also especially important if you did a game beyond The Wall where you might encounter terrifying things like White Walkers and Wights.\n<blockquote>- Why is Turning Someone On restricted to the opposite gender?

I want the playbooks to all be exceptional people. After all, isn't Jamie Lannister, Tywin Lannister, Tyrion Lannister, Bronn, etc all amazingly skilled and one in a million? As for why the Playbooks might interact, that's on them I guess. If your vagabond wants nothing to do with Nobles and never interacts with The Lord, well that's fine, we'll tell his story seperately from theirs, no different than AW.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone" title="Dr_Stone"><img alt="Dr_Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dr_Stone">Dr_Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394326/#Comment_394326" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T13:00:48+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  1:00PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>- Why is Turning Someone On restricted to the opposite gender?

My first AW game hasn't started quite yet.  So, yeah, I'm going a lot based on what you have written more than experience.)<br/><br/>I'm imagining that there are a number of reasons why such a move might be inapplicable.  Maybe you killed their father or have mocked them mercilessly since childhood or whatever.  So, if there's just no chance that they you would be able to turn them on, then the MC might just tell you that you can't make that move.  They just aren't interested.  This does tell you something, but on the flip side, so does their total disinterest in you, right?  It does not necessarily tell you *why* they find you uninteresting (though you might have a guess depending on the situation).<br/><br/>Now that approach does present an interesting question a bit further down the line.  If they're not showing disdain, but are trying to act interested, I'm not sure how that would fit in.  I guess in some cases, you might just say that the player don't have to roll, the person is already turned on (or for other moves, already doing what you want or whatever), but that is kind of cheating them out of their mechanical effect, so that doesn't seem quite right.  I'm not sure in AW and similar how you can really disguise that NPCs are trying to be manipulative like this.  This might be a case where you have to rely on the players going with it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394333/#Comment_394333" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T13:40:12+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  1:40PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I'm playing a female courtier and I try to turn on Renly Baratheon but the GM is like, nope, they aren't attracted to your gender, then I've given your character a secret that you shouldn't have just because you can't make the move.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is <i>exactly</i> what should happen. Secrets are bullshit.<br/><br/>Also, having a move that the GM can just say "nope, doesn't work" is bullshit. Like, having to justify your hack n' slashing of a dragon is fine is cool, that's part of the fiction, but the GM's secret agenda stuff (perhaps literally) cockblocking the PC's agency is kind of a dick move (if you'll pardon the pun). You should, at the very least, get some kind of handout in exchange for having your move blocked, like learning a character's inclinations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394335/#Comment_394335" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T13:48:26+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  1:48PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2012 1:51PM by Pheylorn.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is <i>exactly</i> what should happen.

But it has to do with his agenda, and fits in perfectly with him being a threat and having a threat countdown going on. Ned's player, if he tried to read him at all, obviously missed that roll, and so Littlefinger's plans rolled right on forward. Only Tyrion could figure him out and was able to put a wrench in his plans, but even that didn't last long.<br/><br/>Renly's inclinations, on the other hand, are just part of who he is. They're not even a secret, actually, and plenty of people around him seemed to think it was obvious. Even so, what's the point of keeping this detail a secret? What does it add to the game? Littlefinger's secret agenda adds a whole gang of stuff to the game, but somebody's secret gayness? Not so much.<br/><br/>I mean, Turn Somebody On doesn't have to be just making people want to have sex with you. As a move, with the same mechanics, you could use this to inspire people, stimulate them intellectually, start a bromance or otherwise become friends. But if you're going to give players a move, and a basic move at that, they need to actually be able to use it. And in contexts where the fiction, as they are aware of it, makes sense for them to use it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394341/#Comment_394341" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T14:22:48+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  2:22PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2012 2:25PM by Brendan_Conway.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ETA: Johnstone replied above, missed it in my slowness, so I won't speculate on what he was trying to say.<br/><br/>My take on this issue is that secrets don't need to be kept from the players, even if they are kept from the characters. Another part of Game of Thrones as a story is dramatic irony -- understanding that Littlefinger in no way has Ned's best interests at heart, and knowing that Littlefinger's much more likely to betray Ned than actually help him. So, Ned might not know what Littlefinger's doing, but the players sure can, especially when you take into account that in this example, Littlefinger is more than likely another PC, at least to my eyes. Who cares if the players know that Renly is gay if the characters don't? If Margery Tyrell tries to seduce him, and he doesn't respond, then she probably would know something is up -- I mean, who'd resist Margery Tyrell? But it's fine if her player knows, clearly and decisively, that Renly is gay. I've definitely had this kind of situation crop up in AW without any issues, so I don't see why it'd be a problem. Though I think I'm opening up a whole new can of worms with this line of thought. <br/><br/>Regardless, I think that the best move is just leaving it open to be used on anyone, and if it's a problem, dealing with it then.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394342/#Comment_394342" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T14:31:26+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  2:31PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Regardless, I think that the best move is just leaving it open to be used on anyone, and if it's a problem, dealing with it then. </blockquote>\nI agree.

I think that unless you're going for an exact replica of Vincent's understanding of violence for AW, you might be better served by just one violence move? I feel like there's probably a solution that works well for everybody who might want to use AW for ASoIaF here.<br/><br/>I thought having both defy danger and hold steady was also redundant at first, but thinking about how many times Martin goes on about "the human heart in conflict with itself" this actually kinda makes sense.<br/><br/>But turn somebody on does seem like a version of manipulate. Only some of the characters seduce people or turn them on, and when they do it seems like they are directly manipulating them. Or, if they're not, then the lust directed at them isn't actually a benefit. Although that could just be the fictional representation of becoming vulnerable in order to collect strings, a la the Mortal in MH. still, it kinda seems to me like every character has a different style of manipulation or influencing other people, and while the results are pretty much the same, the circumstances, methods, and victims are different.<br/><br/>If I think about the books as a whole, and specifically the POV characters, I see basic moves being something like this (and this is just me, mind you):<br/><br/>-- figure shit out<br/>-- hatch a plan<br/>-- do something dangerous<br/>-- fight some dudes*<br/>-- talk somebody into something<br/>and<br/>-- experience Faulknerian inner conflict<br/><br/>Figure shit out and hatch a plan could both be roll+cunning. Do you need separate moves for reading people and situations? Do you need a list of questions? I dunno, I think maybe you could get by without. Plans, though. They are all over the books! Then again, that could be relegated to a special move for Tyrion or something, maybe, but my gut says no.<br/><br/>Do something dangerous and fight some dudes could both be roll+dangerous. Although, come to think of it, you don't really need a separate fighting move. It's just doing something dangerous, right? Are there characters who can't fight for shit but who do all sorts of dangerous things? Maybe, or maybe the fighters all have special moves they can use in fights? Maybe instead you have do something dangerous and recover from harm. With a recover move, you can get knocked down and mauled and then be able to heroically pull yourself back up again. Or you roll crap like Tyrion and Sandor did.<br/><br/>Like I said above, it seems to me like different characters have very different manners or styles of talking people into things. So maybe instead of a third stat, you have several different stats and you choose one, like say: Beautiful, Commanding, and Convincing. Cersei is beautiful, she manipulates people by using that. Otherwise, she doesn't get a bonus to her roll. Ned is commanding, he inspires loyalty in his men and they obey him. He doesn't sleep around like Robert did when he was young and good-looking, though. And Tyrion is convincing. When he has leverage, he moves people around like chess pieces. That leverage isn't anything inherent to himself, though (he's not beautiful, nor commanding), he needs to find it elsewhere. Maybe there should be one for magic stuff? Or maybe that's just convince and when you need leverage you pull out some magic.<br/><br/>Maybe some characters could get two of those stats? Or maybe once you get a +1 in one of them, you're stuck with it? Dunno.<br/><br/>But... hmm. You know somebody will want to play the Hound, though, yeah? He's not any of those. He's fearsome, though. Maybe if you take fearsome as your "style" you get -1 to talk somebody into it, but you can roll+dangerous to intimidate people, which puts them at a disadvantage or gives you an advantage against them, going forward. It's like a peripheral move.<br/><br/>And finally, roll+Faulkner. Is the inner turmoil of characters something that needs to be put to the roll of the dice? You can hold steady in the face of fear and whatnot, but the things that each character agonizes over are different. Jon Snow is never scared to fight--duty's what messes his head up--and only the Hound is afraid of fire. All the characters have different issues... so why not make that a game element? You don't even need to have a stat or roll for it, you could just have a central dilemma as part of your character that's right there for the GM to build off of and make difficult choices out of for you to deal with. If the GM can look at your issue and give you a choice between two equally unpalatable outcomes, great! If the GM can look down at your issue and then introduce stuff that emphasizes it, great! Then you don't need to mechanize certain attributes. Tyrion has a hard time because he is ugly. Sandor has a hard time not because he is ugly but because he hates himself so he's an asshole, and his ugliness is just part of that. And yet one of them can talk people into doing stuff while the other can only scare the shit out of people (or kill them).<br/><br/>Anyway, that's just an interpretation based on what I got out of the books. Might be something to think about, might not be the style you're going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394370/#Comment_394370" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T17:15:54+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  5:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Johnstone, that is a lot to digest.

I will spend some time looking over these, I've been hankering to play an AW-like game where there's a "sword-lugger".  I would certainly think a character like Sandor Clegane would qualify, he's maybe not a master swordsman but he'll fuck you up if you get in his way.  <br/><br/>A couple thoughts from a serious AGOIAF enthusiast: <br/><br/>The one playbook I think is missing should be called something like <b>The Kid</b>, or <b>The Heir</b>.  There are a heck of a lot of young nobles running around Westeros in the books, having adventures and making friends and getting tortured but not often killed.  Maybe you could have it as a starter playbook that could switch to another playbook over time.  Arya is the great example.  <br/><br/>The Iron Islands-specific playbook should perhaps be "Captain", representing the Captain of a longship and master of a crew of maybe 40 sailors.  I think he could be another version of the Chopper, maybe mashed up with the Driver regarding the qualities of the ship and crew.  The Captain is really the most specific character type for the Iron Islands, and could also be used for eastern pirates.  <br/><br/>Finally, I'd love to see some basic social class mechanics in the game, maybe as an additional stat (-1/+0/+1/+2) with its own move and a different range for each playbook.  The Lord obviously gets a higher range, the Vagabond lower -- but there's a range, so you can trade off between a Vagabond on the Great Council like Varys and a Vagabond who acts as fixer for a bastard mercenary captain.  One of the things I loved about the old game Bushido was how social class had a real effect on play.  <br/><br/>Regarding different social classes and PC's, I think it's just like regular Apocalypse World, the players have to figure how their characters interact regularly.  It's not that hard to come up with connections.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fealoro" title="fealoro"><img alt="fealoro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fealoro">fealoro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394402/#Comment_394402" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T00:25:28+00:00" title="October 23, 2012 12:25AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2012 12:46AM by fealoro.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Pheylorn<br/>I have just a suggestion/advise.<br/>I think that one of the feature of the fiction of the Saga is that rarely the main characters are in the same place or in the same quest. Most of the time they each ones are on themself, dealing with his own doom, from where they could in case hinder the others characters plan.<br/>I think that the basic framework of AW do not handle this thing so much. You can work with an aggressive framing, but you lose most of the PC vs PC interactions.<br/>You can avoid this feature and play as a party (as most of fantasy RPG) but I think you could lose some of the taste of the Saga.<br/><br/>My first solution would be to have most of the moves to have a long distance effect, maybe through minions or allies. So each player can play and have an interaction even if its PC is not in the scene. <br/><br/>Another thing could be to organize the scenes with a principal PC and the other player playing a secondary PC in some way related with their principal PC. (I know I'm complicating a lot, it is just to give something to think about), and then move to another principal PC, in the same way that happen in the books.<br/><br/>Well, just my two cents.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394424/#Comment_394424" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-23T06:49:10+00:00" title="October 23, 2012  6:49AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following this with interest.

This works really well for Night's Watch Rangers and for other southern woodspeople. <br/><br/>The Knight has been changed to the Commander and I've added some options for your force to make them either cavalry or sailors so now Iron Islanders are represented in a playbook.<br/><br/>I added The Knight in as it's own playbook again. With a Born in the Saddle move to emphasize their training at traditional knightly combat. Also gave them some dueling and honour based String moves.<br/><br/>I took out the prorpietor and just hacked that playbook to make "The Player", a tentative name for it. A playbook to better represent Tyrion, Littefinger and Varys.<br/><br/>Also changed the Sherherd playbook to The Blessed and made the moves a little more generic for a leader of peoples.

I'd just use the original AW stat names, if they're functionally equivalent.<br/><br/>2. The design isn't super tight. As Johnstone pointed out, you can't necessarily throw a bunch of moves from different contexts together and expect it to work like magic. Then again, it's probably good enough to play!<br/><br/>3. Replicating the "what's going on in different parts of the world" style of storytelling could be a challenge in an AW framework! It's much more interesting if the players get to interact. I'd be interested to see players each have a separate character in each storyline, perhaps trading low-status characters with high-status characters.

How do we play all those young nobles running around and coming of age?<br/><br/>That said, there's a lot of cool stuff here, and a few of the playbooks really jump out at me as cool, original applications of the AW/M-Hearts system. I particularly like the Scout!<br/><br/>And this is probably my favourite (new) move:\n<blockquote><i>Sexy and vulnerable: if someone has a String on you, gain +1 to turning them on.</i></blockquote>\nI love it!

Especially given the high mortality rates of GoT characters...<br/><br/>*...which points at a slightly larger problem/question. Is this game about simply following the lives of people in the GoT world, or is it about the throne war?<br/><br/>*Especially if it's the latter, mass combat needs a bit more thought. Frankly, I'd give armies their own playbooks, stats and moves. <br/><br/>The stats would be something like Archery, Infantry, Cavalry, Resolve, and Leadership. <br/><br/>Size could simply be represented by HP/how many harm-clock pie slices they have (but taking harm from enemy forces could force a Resolve roll or else the force takes *more* harm, the latter harm being dudes running away). <br/><br/>Move ideas: Archery\u2014Suppressive Fire and Direct Fire (thank you Burning Empires), Infantry\u2014Defend a Position and Advance, Cavalry\u2014Charge and Pursue, Resolve\u2014Hold Steady, Leadership\u2014Orate and Devise Clever Strategem. Obviously I'm just brainstorming here, and haven't fully thought through what effects the Moves should have, but I think a fair number of them grant +1 or even +2 Forward to other Moves. Which rewards players for being careful and strategizing, but the GM^ is part of the conversation, too (By the way, the assymetry with Resolve only having one Move and the others having two is deliberate. Resolve is basically not used actively, but if you don't have it, boy howdy does your army disintegrate quickly. We do see this happen with large but ill-prepared forces in the books.)<br/><br/>I think this is pretty workable. An army with Archery -1, Infantry 3, Cavalry 1, Resolve 2, and Leadership 0 functions very differently from one with Archery 3, Infantry 1, Cavalry -2, Resolve 1, and Leadership 2, for instance. (-2 basically means, "We don't even have this in our army, and have to steal our enemy's shit to even attempt this.)<br/><br/>*Curious how well the non-Westerosi can be modeled by your current array of playbooks.<br/><br/>^He should really be called the G(RR)M. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395064/#Comment_395064" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T12:17:04+00:00" title="October 27, 2012 12:17PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!<br/><br/>Agreed on the mass combat system.<br/><br/>Mobility and Supplies and/or Discipline (how likely are your troops to, say, rape and pillage a town you've ordered them not to) could also be interesting variable or stats to play with. <br/><br/>I could definitely see this being interesting: for instance, you might get a prophet character (the Blessed, maybe?) to make a speech in front of the assembled troops, giving them a +1 forward to their next Resolve roll. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395092/#Comment_395092" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T21:33:50+00:00" title="October 27, 2012  9:33PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there's definitely fruitful room for interaction between individual characters and armies-as-characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401154/#Comment_401154" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T07:55:34+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  7:55AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello again!<br/><br/>I recently laid out the playbooks in a Monsterhearts style format.

Very cool.<br/>How are you dealing with multiple storylines in your playtesting?  Or is everyone together?<br/><br/>Re. troupe play- I wonder about a lead/minor character mechanism, so you don't wind up with GRRMitis (spiraling numbers of secondary characters with their own storylines, each begetting a new wave of secondaries).  Maybe scenes have to feature a Protagonist, and you give them a String on you to bring your Minor character into their 'POV chapter'.<br/><br/>As for giving out secondary characters-<br/>Maybe you just get one each per agreed storyline/location.<br/>Maybe you take an advance, or spend a String on that character to gain a secondary in their storyline.<br/><br/>As an extension of this, maybe primary and secondary playbooks could differ.  But, that would be a lot more work for uncertain benefit.  The earlier idea of high/low status may work well.  Or maybe Protagonist is a move you can pick for one of your characters- one that gets you a Death move, amongst other things.  Just spitballing, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401177/#Comment_401177" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T13:06:52+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  1:06PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Denys, thank you for the kind comment.<br/><br/>Cneph, thank you for your comments as well.

How to implement that is a good question.  (But maybe A World of Ice and Fire isn't about multiple pretenders to the throne, at whatever scale that throne is.)<br/><br/>I could envisage a more generic, secondary character playbook.  These are ideas, I've not even mentally tested them against the role secondary characters tend to follow in the storylines.  Can we agree on some?  Is Jorah Mormont still secondary?  What about Old Bear Mormont?  Samwell?  Brienne?<br/><br/>The secondary playbook should be half-size of a main playbook.<br/><br/>Primary character: The Protagonist playbook played by the same player, i.e. the main character played by this player.  Each Protagonist stars in their own Point Of View storyline, or they may share it with another Protagonist, for a time.<br/>Plotline character:  The Protagonist playbook played by another player whose Point of View chapters you are appearing in.<br/>Secondary character:  If you do not already play a character in this storyline, you can spend a String on a Protagonist to create a Secondary character in their Point of View storyline, using this playbook.<br/>(This could be confusing, any better ways to deliniate this?  I'd use Patron, but that could promote a particular relationship, and really isn't any clearer.)<br/><br/>Allocate your stats: +1, +1, 0, -1, -1.  Add 1 to one of these scores.<br/><br/>You get all the basic moves, and pick one move from a main playbook.  This playbook and move may inform the role you play in the Point of View storyline.<br/><br/>Pick looks and a gear package, (optionally?) from the same main playbook.  For one of these, choose:  You lost it (how?), you owe the Plotline character for it, it ties you to your Primary character<br/><br/>When you would mark XP, your Primary character can mark XP instead.<br/><br/>When you are in a scene, your Primary character can spend and gain Strings as if they were present.<br/><br/>Strings:<br/>Your Primary character is aware of your existence and has an interest.  They take a String on you.  (E.g. Varys (or Robert) on Jorah in Dany's POV)<br/>You have been of service to the Plotline character, whether they know of it or not.  Take a String on them.<br/>You owe your current station and situation to the Plotline character.  They take two Strings on you.<br/>...And pick another one to tie you to another secondary character in the POV, maybe an exchange of Strings.  Like 'you met them on the stairs to the tower rookery' or similar.<br/>(How should a player spending Strings from one of their characters on another of their characters work?  Would we need a means for the Primary to gain more Strings on the Secondary?)<br/><br/>Specials:<br/>When you have sex, your Primary characters sex move activates.  (Just an idea, this probably won't work out too easily).<br/>If you die, the ties that bind you to your Primary character are revealed.  The Strings you have on the Plotline character transfer over to your Primary.  The Strings the Plotline character has on you become Strings on your Primary.

This is exactly how to play AWOIAF - choose several interrelated centres of narrative action, with a different group of characters in each, each MC'd by a different player (giving that player "ownership" over that part of the world). As characters circulate from centre to centre, thet can temporarily become NPCs as necessary. As the story unfolds, the centres will shift and affect one another. Each session, depending on the number of players, you would try to play out one chapter for each centre. For example:<br/><br/>King's Landing<br/>MC: Tim<br/>PCs: The Imp (Laura), Cersei (Paul), Sansa (Jen)<br/><br/>The Wall<br/>MC: Laura<br/>PCs: Jon Snow (Paul), The Old Bear (Jen), Mance Rayder (Tim)<br/><br/>Across the Narrow Sea<br/>MC: Paul<br/>PCs: Danaerys (Jen), Ser Jorah (Tim), Daario Naharis (Laura)<br/><br/>The Road to Harrenhal<br/>MC: Jen<br/>PCs: Brienne of Tarth (Tim), Jamie Lannister (Laura), Tywin Lannister (Paul)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404114/#Comment_404114" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T09:44:42+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  9:44AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            YES.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404128/#Comment_404128" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T12:10:02+00:00" title="January 20, 2013 12:10PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That does sound like an awesome way to do this game.

A player can use a scene token to frame a scene, either for her character or for another character (her character can still be in that scene). Either the first scene of the session for your character or the last scene for your character has to be framed by someone else. A session is over when everyone has spend his or her tokens. <br/><br/>This would create the often out of control seeming element of the scenes and would allow to focus more on specific characters. When your character is not in the scene you can play an NPC. (A NPC may be directly claimed by spending a scene token, i am not sure)<br/><br/>This was the general structure i had in my mind.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Open "campaign" fronts shared by everyone, and advancable by any MC, are very intriguing.<br/><br/>Agreed that adding mechanics isn't necessary - as Pheylorn says, this approach, while suited to *W games, could work with any system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404165/#Comment_404165" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T17:41:14+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  5:41PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so last week I had some ideas for revamping the basic moves in WOIAF and I recorded some of my thoughts. Now this set of moves does remove the Strings and Conditions from the game and I really don't know if that's what I want. I really like that mechanic but I worry it may be too much like Monsterhearts and not enough like Westeros. I could bring in the Hx rules from AW instead, or maybe something new. I honestly don't know. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyways, if you'd like, please look over these basic moves and let me know what you think. I would love some constructive criticism and feedback.<br/><br/>New Stats<br/><br/>Focus, Edge, Presence, Sense, Wealth<br/><br/>Basic Moves<br/><br/>Do Something Dangerous<br/>When you do something dangerous, roll+focus. On a 10+, you do it. On a 7\u20139, you flinch, hesitate, or stall: the MC can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.<br/><br/>Assault<br/>When you assault, roll+edge. On a hit, inflict harm and receive harm. On a 10+, choose 2:<br/>\u2022 suffer one less harm<br/>\u2022 achieve a goal or objective<br/>\u2022 inflict one additional harm<br/>\u2022 frighten or scatter your enemy<br/>On a 7\u20139, choose 1:<br/>\u2022 achieve a goal or objective<br/>\u2022 inflict one additional harm<br/><br/>Seduce or Manipulate<br/>When you seduce or manipulate an NPC, tell them what you want and roll+presence. On a hit, they ask you to promise <br/>something first, and do it if you promise. On a 10+, whether you keep your promise is up to you, later. On a 7\u20139, they need some concrete assurance right now. For PCs: on a 10+, both. On a 7\u20139, choose 1:<br/>\u2022 if they do it, they mark experience<br/>\u2022 if they refuse, it\u2019s doing something dangerous (no experience for rolling if stat is highlighted)<br/><br/>Look for Answers<br/>When you look for answers, roll+sense. On a hit, ask the MC (or appropriate player) questions about the situation or someone you\u2019re observing, they must answer honestly. On a 10+, ask 2. On a 7-9, ask 1.<br/><br/>Buy Something<br/>When you buy something, roll+wealth. On a 10+, you\u2019re able to afford the item but tax your wealth by one. On a 7-9,  you\u2019re able to afford the item but tax your wealth by one and choose 1:<br/>\u2022 tax your wealth by an additional one<br/>\u2022 there\u2019s a catch, and you\u2019re not going to like it<br/>\u2022 it\u2019s not quite what you expected<br/>Taxing your wealth means lowering your wealth score by the number given temporarily. At the beginning of every session, you may remove one point of tax from your wealth score.<br/><br/>Harm<br/>I wonder if simplifying wounds would be a better move. Maybe as simple of adding in two wounds or two conditions like injured and dead. Haha is that too abstract or a welcome change? Again, I dunno, just some thoughts. I also played with the idea of using 4-harm track much like Monsterhearts uses.<br/><br/>What do you guys think of a character creation system where each player chooses a character from let's say 3 groups, high-born nobles, low-born nobles and commoners. Then you split those groups to a different MC like so many of you have suggested above and that would allow everyone to play a character from different social and economic situations. Again, just a thought, might be silly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks for reading.

Like you can gain favour or secrets and they have seperate mechanical effects, but that might be too much. Here's my thoughts for favours at least.<br/><br/>You can spend a Favour on another PC to:<br/>-Add 1 to your roll against them (choose after rolling).<br/>-Subtract 1 from their roll against you (choose after rolling).<br/>-Offer them an experience point to do what you want.<br/>-Add an extra harm to whatever harm you\u2019re dealing them.

Not too different from the previous basic moves, but it's another take on it.<br/><br/>Stats: Focus, Guile, Charm, Edge, Insight, Wealth<br/><br/>Focus used for Do Something Dangerous<br/>Guile used for Root Out Secrets<br/>Charm used for Curry Favour<br/>Edge use for Assault and Threaten<br/>Insight used for Read a Person/Sitch<br/>Wealth used for Gathering Resources<br/><br/>Root Out Secrets will be used to gain Secrets against PCs and NPCs alike.<br/>Curry Favour will be used to gain Favour against PCs and NPCs alike.<br/>Assault will be used for combat and leading armies into battle and threatening people with legit violence.<br/>Read a Person/Sitch will work as it does now but with a modified list of questions, perhaps with less specific questions to allow for some wiggle room in answering. The point would be to allow for some deception among an intrigue game.<br/>Wealth maybe as a go-to for your capacity to afford equipment, goods and armies. This may also have to be status related thing, where a +1 wealth for a major noble means a great deal more in terms of disposable income than it would for a low-born character. This wealth idea still irks me though, it\u2019s so hard to capture the wealth of nobility vs their expenses and compared to a commoner.<br/><br/>Status: <br/>Low-born: -2 to curry favour against major nobles, -1 against minor nobles. +2 to Root Out Secrets against major nobles and +1 against minor nobles. <br/>Minor noble: -1 to curry favour against major nobles, +1 against low-born. +1 to Root Out Secrets against major nobles and -1 against low-born.<br/>Major noble: +2 to curry favour against low-born, +1 against minor nobles. -2 to Root Out Secrets against low-born and -1 against minor nobles.<br/><br/>Favours<br/>You can spend a Favour to:<br/>-Add 1 to your roll against them (choose after rolling).<br/>-Offer them an experience point to do what you want. (PC\u2019s only)<br/>-Subtract a harm to whatever harm they\u2019re dealing to someone.<br/>-Get them to do something for you, just this once.

(NPC\u2019s only)<br/><br/>When you do something dangerous, roll+focus. On a 10+, you do it. On a 7\u20139, you flinch, hesitate, or stall: the MC can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.<br/><br/>When you Root Out Secrets, roll+guile. On a 10+, take a Secret against them. On a 7-9, they choose one: promise something they think you want, give you a Secret against them and take a Favour against you.<br/><br/>When you Curry Favour, roll+charm. On a 10+, take a Favour against them. On a 7-9, they choose one: promise something they think you want, give you a Favour against them and take a Secret against you.<br/><br/>When you Assault, roll+edge. On a hit, inflict harm and receive harm. On a 10+, choose 2:<br/>\u2022 suffer one less harm<br/>\u2022 achieve a goal or objective<br/>\u2022 inflict one additional harm<br/>\u2022 frighten or scatter your enemy<br/>On a 7\u20139, choose 1:<br/>\u2022 achieve a goal or objective<br/>\u2022 inflict one additional harm<br/><br/>When you Threaten someone with execution or maiming, roll+edge. On a 10+, they have to choose: force your hand and suck it up, or cave and do what you want. On a 7\u20139, they can instead choose 1:<br/>\u2022 force your hand and suck it up<br/>\u2022 cave and do what you want<br/>\u2022 give you one of their Secrets or Favours on someone else<br/>\u2022 give you a Favour and Secret against them<br/><br/>When you Study a charged situation, roll+insight. On a hit, you can ask the MC questions. Whenever you act on one of the MC\u2019s answers, take +1. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 1:<br/>\u2022 where\u2019s my best escape route / way in / way past?<br/>\u2022 which enemy is most vulnerable to me?<br/>\u2022 what is the biggest threat to me?<br/>\u2022 what should I be on the lookout for?<br/>\u2022 what\u2019s my enemy\u2019s true position?<br/>\u2022 who\u2019s in control here?<br/>\u2022 what's happened here recently?<br/>\u2022 what is about to happen here?<br/><br/>When you Read a person in a charged interaction, roll+sense. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. While you\u2019re interacting with them,<br/>spend your hold to ask their player questions, 1 for 1:<br/>\u2022 is your character being honest with me?<br/>\u2022 what\u2019s your character really feeling?<br/>\u2022 what does your character intend to do?<br/>\u2022 what does your character wish I\u2019d do?<br/>\u2022 how could I get your character to ___? <br/><br/>At the beginning of the session, roll+wealth to Gather Resources at your disposal for the needs of the session. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. On a miss, someone you owe, money or fealty to, is going to come  collect. While you have hold, you can afford any items or service normally within your means.

Maybe, instead, for each class, you just have a list of kinds of things they expect and what kinds of things they value. So, if you're a noble and you offer to wash my feet, you're currying favour from me. But if you're a servant and you do that, it's just expected--nothing special. In fact, I might consider punishing you if you *didn't* wash my feet, right?<br/><br/>Same for wealth. You could frame it as a playbook move ("When you're near your Great Hall and your coffers, you can buy pretty much anything you like..."), or just put in a "When you attempt to acquire something beyond your financial grasp" move. It's pretty obvious that the move would be rolled under very different circumstances by a noble and by a servant.<br/><br/>I really like the idea of writing the questions used on the "reading" moves so that the answerer has a bit of wiggle room. Your earlier version ("ask any question, the player must answer honestly") seems like it would very much work against any kind of intrigue play.<br/><br/>Another option might be to make the "read a person" move act more like a manipulate/seduce move. I want to know something about you, I have to seduce you, make myself vulnerable, or offer you a promise or gift of some kind. Then we roll, and if the roll goes well, you have to choose between giving up that secret (and marking experience, maybe?) and other things you may not want to do (like letting you gain a String on me, for example, or making a bad name for myself, or other things).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404205/#Comment_404205" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-21T09:59:47+00:00" title="January 21, 2013  9:59AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2013 10:00AM by Pheylorn.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>For instance, do you really need all those modifiers for certain classes to curry favour with another class?</blockquote>That's a good question.

I suspect that at least one of the other players are somehow involved in the plot - maybe Littlefinger is a PC - but it's not a necessity.<br/><br/>I see it as a countdown with Cersei Lannister as the main Threat (Joffrey also being a Threat in that Front, but I'd argue not the main one). Early in the countdown, Robert dies. Later in the countdown, Janos Slynt's Gold Cloaks are bribed and change allegiance, making Ned's presence in King's Landing fraught with danger at any opportunity.<br/><br/>Ned's player, driven by honour and justice, unwittingly manoeuvres into exactly the position most dangerous to him, one which he has no way out of. A handful of MC moves that definitely apply:<br/><br/>Capture someone<br/>Put someone in a spot<br/>Inflict harm as established<br/>Turn their move back on them<br/><br/>Cersei would probably represent a Brute: Family threat (impulse: to close ranks, protect their own) and as such would also provide access to the following suitable MC Moves:<br/><br/>Make a coordinated attack with a coherent objective<br/>Tell stories (truth, lies, [allegories, homilies])<br/>[Rigidly follow or] Defy authority<br/><br/>Remember everything follows from the fiction. The moment Ned is surrounded by Gold Cloaks in the throne room and his own guard was killed, that was it for him.
