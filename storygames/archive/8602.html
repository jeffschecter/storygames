I'm including the PDF with pre-orders.<br/><br/>I'm trying a mixture of methods to promote the release including the traditional banners on rpg.net, and I'll post across the rpg news-sites too. But I'm also trying something different - a mutant-city-blues themed murder mystery competition. I've plugged this on the <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/gumshoe/mutant/competition.html" rel="nofollow">MCB website</a> and the new January <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/SeePageXX/index.html" rel="nofollow">Page XX</a>. Please take a look, and enter if you get the chance. If you would like to have a clue placed on your website, please whisper me. I'll link to you as a form of cross-promotion.<br/><br/>It's much harder to get buzz for something completely new, than for a well-known name such as Cthulhu, and I'd be interested to read your feedback and suggestions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190730/#Comment_190730" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-31T09:16:53+00:00" title="January 31, 2009  9:16AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a great product!

And that's my sense from what I've previously read about GUMSHOE, that's it's about solving mysteries. But for Mutant City Blues you also reference institutions in the setting (like "Investigation Unit") and you blow out the details of a "new science" of working with evidence and genetic relationships.<br/><br/>So, in play, is Mutant City Blues a game about the exploration of mysteries, or is it a police/forensics procedural game about characters involved in a process of investigating crimes?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191008/#Comment_191008" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T09:53:32+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  9:53AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, it's about solving mysteries.

You'll pursue the leads to the end of the case, then it's up to the DA - although there are sometimes court scenes. This is not to say that the GM can't devise new leads on the fly based on player input (eg we check the CCTV footage).<br/><br/>The default position is that you will get a conviction, but as GM you can add plot hooks which allow people to get off, plea bargain, or whatever in order to explore PCs backstories or set up future plot hooks.<br/><br/>It's somewhere between the CSI/Law and Order end (more procedural) of the spectrum and The Wire and The Shield at the other end.<br/><br/>Do you think the sell text is unhelpful or misleading?<br/><br/>Simon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192087/#Comment_192087" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T09:38:34+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  9:38AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Simon,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pelgrane</cite>Do you think the sell text is unhelpful or misleading?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure.

By "plot hooks" you mean the GM decides a specific twist of events would be fun to explore? Tell me about the kinds of court scenes you might have.<br/><br/>Paul<br/><br/>It's not in itself a major part of the game, and here is the sidebar summarising it. You can also have detectives (PCs) questioned in hostile fashion about their powers - powers are connected with defects, so defense attorneys can imply that the detectives are megalomaniacs, or sex-crazed or addictive. There's a chapter &lt; a href="<a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/GUMSHOE/mutant/files/demo.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pelgranepress.com/GUMSHOE/mutant/files/demo.pdf</a>"&gt;here online which covers what PCs do in the game. There is no system-based criterion for determining whether a criminal is convicted.<br/><br/><i>Although the eventual disposition of their investigations in court must be uppermost in detectives\u2019 minds as they pursue the cases, they rarely take center stage in a Mutant City Blues game. Usually a scenario can conclude with a quick summary of the prosecution and sentencing of the guilty party, as part of a brief denouement.<br/>As a change of pace, however, a case may include one or more court sequences. A story may begin with the acquittal of a<br/>clearly guilty suspect. Perhaps supporting character detectives or forensic scientists have botched the case in some way. Maybe corruption played a part in the acquittal.<br/>The PCs now have to pursue the perp for a different crime entirely, this time making sure their case is ironclad. However, the doctrine of double jeopardy prevents the suspect from being retried on the same charges, and the detectives have to be careful to avoid accusations of harassment. (Double jeopardy may not be an issue in certain non- US jurisdictions. For example, in Canada, prosecutors as well as defense attorneys are allowed to appeal verdicts.)<br/>Alternately, a court scene may lead a detective to a new crime. Perhaps he\u2019s on the witness stand when he spots a crucial piece of evidence suggesting that the defendant has been framed. Now he must convince prosecutors to abandon their case so he can find the real culprit.<br/>If the PCs flagrantly violate police procedure or the civil rights of their clients, you may feel the need to preserve the believability of your series by continuing a case all the way to its horrifying implosion before a judge.<br/>Sub-plots can also feature scenes that take place in court.<br/>Use the directed scene method to keep all players engaged in court scenes. Give uninvolved players temporary roles as prosecutors, defense lawyers, witnesses, and spectators. You\u2019ll probably want to keep the judge as a character under your control, so that you can keep a lid on the pacing and outcome of court sequences.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
