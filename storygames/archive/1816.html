                    So, my game designy friends are like, "Let's make a multi-genre RPG!"  And I'm like, "How the hell am I supposed to focus on everything if I have ADHD?"<br/><br/>Then Guardians of Order goes SPLAT ARRGH DIE.<br/><br/>And a "Any genre you want, as long as it's anime" game looks appealing.  Cuz me and all my friends love the big eyes, the small mouths, and the laser sharks and the drama.<br/><br/>In light of the most awesomest Verb for a game evar.<br/><br/>Anime characters don't always fight.  They don't always love.  They don't always outwit sugar addicted detectives while flipping out and killing people by writing thier names in the Death Note.<br/><br/>They do, however, always <b>Exemplify beliefs!</b>  Beliefs which I'm going to make a key part of the system, oooooh yes.<br/><br/>Obviously, externally, and through every act.<br/><br/>The problem is, for adverbs?<br/><br/>I got... er...  Physically.  Intuitively.  Rationally.  Socially.  Violently, which comes with it's own set of problems because it's not always a constant.  Obviously and Covertly, which are probably variants on the other five.  Any others?<br/><br/>I want to follow Vincent's latest Dangerous Ideas on this one - his Dangerous Idea being to Have stats and have those stats intertwine to have your conflict arena rolls.<br/><br/>I'm thinking four arenas or stats, and yin (covert) and yang (OVERT) aspects to each.<br/><br/>Consider this a cluster of darts.  I'm done rambling.<br/><br/>Edited to add:  By anime I mean "anime and manga," mmmkay?                </div>

                            I'd strongly argue that anime is not even as broad a genre as you think it is.  Fundamentally, it's a (broad set of) style(s) of drawing humans, and not much more.<br/><br/>I'd be hard pressed to say that a character in, I dunno, an instructional video about VCR use is explemplifying beliefs.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Well, there's different kinds of anime, to be sure. We're probably not talking about roleplaying Grave of the Fireflies here (though with this crowd it's hard to say 100% for certain), but there's a certain range of anime that people typically think of when the word comes up. I think "exemplify beliefs" fits really well for the mainstream of melodramatic shounen and shoujo anime. You could certainly look that way at, say, Naurto, Bleach, Flame of Recca, Sailor Moon, Fruits Basket, etc., to say nothing of Rurouni Kenshin.<br/><br/>As a designer I'm more interested in doing games that focus on specific genres within anime and other otaku media, but I'd like to see where this goes all the same.                        </div>

                            Kay.<br/><br/>A friend of mine who is Very Very Into Indie Games came back from college and talked with me on this design.<br/><br/>He suggested you make a character Background, and from that come the beliefs or Ideals. and from those come the Stats.  I added "...and from those come the Powers and Traits."  Like a tree branching upward on the character sheet.  Or an explosion radiating from it's center.<br/><br/>The Background?  You write a short Background for your character, like in Heroquest.  Then you use key events in it to come up with important Ideals for your character to follow and cool Descriptors of your characters abilities.  I want there to be at least two Ideals that can butt heads, and when they do, the friction creates sparks that give you new abilities when you resolve the friction.  Not XP - abilities.  Directly.<br/><br/>He also suggested the normal categories of stats - Physical, Mental, Social, Resources - but the addition of differing levels of <i>descriptors</i> for them.  Some very different social descriptors would be "Strange mix of Cute and Seductive" and "Air of Sophistication."  Descriptors in a stat have points.  They are both dice pool and hit points.  Use any two descriptors - yes, they can be different categories of descriptor - in a roll.  If you use them and they aren't apropos, take the dice for them.  If one is apropos as determined by the players and GM, take +1 die for it.  If one is PERFECT, take +2 dice for it.  These bonuses stack.<br/><br/>I'd like to further add traits or powers under the descriptors that add additional "appropriateness bonuses" but I'm not sure how.<br/><br/>A possible character with 7 descriptors and 24 points in them.<br/><br/>"Nightmare Rouser Faye"  Faye Aino<br/><br/>Taken from the Seelie Court for her protection at the order of her mother, Queen Tatiana, just before the wolves of the Unseelie Lord of Nightmare Apeiron descended on Tatiana, the sidhe child who her adoptive parents, a lesbian couple named Rose and Sakura, would name Faye lived a fairly normal human life before she began to dream of life in the Faerie Realms.  Now, Apeiron grows bolder and sends his lieutenants to shape nightmare creatures to siphon the dreams of mortals.  Only with the aid of magical hierlooms that are her royal birthright can Faye ensure that foul Nightmares will plague human dreams no more!  Trouble is, they come out at night... and school is getting more difficult... and her parents have noticed her grades dropping, and the bruises...<br/><br/>Ideal: Foul creatures of Nightmare will plague human dreams no more!<br/>Ideal: I can't put my parents in danger, even if I need to lie to them to protect them. <br/>Ideal: Who were my birthparents, why do I have inhuman powers?  I must find out who I am.<br/><br/>Physical: I'm an atheletic girl who can get double SS on some DDR songs, on a good day. 4/4<br/>Mental: I dream of what may be - so I can stop it. 4/4  My parents being lesbians have taught me the value of an open mind. 3/3<br/>Social:  I know how to dress, and I look good, in a genki kinda way. 4/4  I can get people to question thier assumptions. 4/4<br/>Resources:  My allowance ain't extravagant, but I can afford to eat out. 2/2  I have this strange crystal pendant and some other magical gear. 3/3                        </div>

                            Another thing is that especially for the shounen fighting anime (eventually I want to design a game around this genre), I think there needs to be a way to introduce new traits on the fly in different ways. Fighters always have the moments of "Looks like I'll have to try this new technique I've been developing," or even "I just figured out a new technique that will defeat you!"                        </div>

Quoted for truth.  This is a melodrama thing, too.<br/><br/>New traits on the fly, huh?  Seems cool.  Tie them into the Descriptors as stunts and mark them on the character sheet?                        </div>

                            I'm working on an anime-inspired space opera right now, and yeah, beliefs hit pretty close to the core for anime-as-style. The game should be all about the melodrama, in the midst of the action. It's also about a relationship map...and giant robots...I'll shut up now.<br/><br/>Neko, there should also be mechanics for having your ass kicked in order to get more powerful, at the risk of just losing. *Every* shonen fighting anime has those moments when the characters should just be *out*, but that's when they always get a second wind (and sometimes new powers). Get beat up enough, you get more powerful, but if you judge it wrong, you just pass the threshold and you're out. Something like that.<br/><br/>I'll second Shreyas' comment about New Exalted. From what little I saw of it, it looked very tacked on and not integrated into system well.                        </div>
