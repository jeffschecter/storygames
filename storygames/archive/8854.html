I'll try to explain what I mean by this, but what I am curious about is what has driven the direction of this design trend.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, traditional games, like D&amp;D, GURPS, whatever.  They have these sets of rules for what you do in a game.  You can see 90 feet in the dark, except elves can see 120.  When you attack, you use this skill and you roll this die and then there's an opposed roll to see if it damages you.  Etc, etc.  The point is that the rules are directly related to the thing that is going on in the game.  They have no merit outside of what they are directly trying to allow players to do.  You can't really consider each mechanic a game into itself (I don't go around rolling a d20 just for fun, really...or not usually).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis new trend that I see is that many indie RPG designers are creating dice and card games, and then somehow folding narrative in on top of that.  It's almost like we take any game, but then instead of players just taking a mechanical turn in that game, we add a bit of fiction each time.  It's like the story creation is just juxtaposed on the mechanics.  In the Euro Boardgame Speak, you'd say the theme is "pasted on".  In fact, you could rip off the narrative part of the game and just play the mechanical game if you wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome recent games that seem to be good examples of this:  Agora (playtest) and Sons of Liberty.  Both of those games are super cool, but you could seemingly play either as a dice or card game, without ever telling a bit of fiction.  There's probably some other great examples of this as well that I can't think of right now or just don't know about.  I even inadvertently did this when I created my entry for the Genre Redesign Contest, and didnt' even notice it's just basically a rip of a Knizia card game and adding a story (via poem) on top of it).<br/>\n<br/>\nRiffing on this, seems like you can create a "Story game" out of even any existing game today.  Want to play an economic RPG?  Why not play Monopoly and each time you land on a square, you narrate what happens.  Ok, I don't dig Monopoly, but there are other games you could use.  Craps as a narrative game.  Rummy?  Any game could potentially work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here's where my questions lie:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  Why do we not just tell a freeform collaborative story?  Why do we need to wrap rules (even nebulous ones) around the narrative?  I feel this need too, but I don't know why.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  What has driven the design community in this direction?<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Where do we go from here?  How do we push it to the next level again?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading!  If you have any input (even if to say "Duh!" or "you're full of it, these rules are totatlly tied to the game and could not be ripped out"), I'd love to hear it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195814/#Comment_195814" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T07:00:42+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  7:00AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2009 7:01AM by GB_Steve.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read any of the essays on <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles" rel="nofollow">the Forge</a>?<br/><br/>That's one of the places it all started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195815/#Comment_195815" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T07:05:44+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  7:05AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 6, 2009 7:24AM by Jesse.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello,<br/><br/>Okay, so System in the broadest sense of the word is how we communicate changes in the developing fiction to one another.  That could be as simple as "I declare what I do and the GM tells me what happens."  That's why there's no such thing as a Systemless game.  Once you recognize that broadest definition of System you can then start thinking about how elements of design can shape the creative dialogue of the players.  So you start thinking not just what your game is "about" in terms of characters and settings and situation but also in terms of how you want the players to go about *doing* that at the social and creative level.  The best designers take the totality of the social and creative dialogue into account.<br/><br/>Failure to totally grasp this has lead some people to miss (and dismiss) certain elements of various designs simply because there are no "mechanics" attached.  For example, there's a reason that Characters in Dirty Secrets are made up of only demographics.  Similarly, there's a reason you read off the Radio Lightening announcements at the top of each chapter of Grey Ranks.  Design is so much larger than just the mechanics.<br/><br/>I think that following from that people often miss the role the developing fiction can have on mechanics applications.  For example, the Raise-See-Raise mini-game in Dogs in the Vineyard may seem like it could stand on its own but it can't.  Without understanding the fictional context of the Raise there's no way to judge whether Taking The Blow or Block/Dodge or Reversing The Blow is what you want to have happen.  Without the fictional context "escalation" means nothing.  Similarly, I can tell you right now that the fiction in Sons of Liberty matters.  While playing I found myself "stuck" several times because I couldn't figure out how to play my cards based on the fact that they have to conform to certain fictional constraints.  Without those "pauses" created by those fictional constraints I don't think the game would play very well at all.<br/><br/>So those are my answers.  Rules shape the creative dialogue of the group in ways that "freeforming" does not.  I want that structure, purpose, and direction in my play.  However, part of that "structure" involves the feedback from the developing fiction so, no, I don't think the rules in these games are "nebulous."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195820/#Comment_195820" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T07:26:43+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  7:26AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's what I think is the basis for this: Step on up. Any influence the fiction can have on the mechanics (because that's what we're talking about here, removing the possibility for fiction to influence mechanics) is a potential threat to the player who wants to play to win. There was a recent diiscussion about this at a Swedish RPG forum, and we have a very outspoken "play-to-win" guy there. It's like this:<br/><br/>Let's say we're playing D&amp;D. You have a number of coins and want to buy a sword. You can buy a fire sword or an ice sword, both of which have advantages against different enemies. You can only afford one of them. This might seem like a tactical decision, but it's completely moot. It's really up to the DM what kind of enemies you face. So you have no basis for making your decision, other than "guess the DM", which isn't very satisfying for a lot of players.<br/><br/>Now let's game the game up a bit. Let's add a mechanic that <i>decides</i> what kind of monsters you're facing. Suddenly, you can look at that mechanic and try to predict which weapon will be most useful. Suddenly you can make real tactical decisions. Letting the fiction influence the mechanics will screw up the game if you're playing to win, because you can't "game" arbitrary decisions. So if you want to be able to play to win in a real sense, you basically need to remove that stuff from the game. Notice how, in D&amp;D, the big tactical decisions are in combat and in character creation, where arbitrary decisions are much rarer.<br/><br/>Contrast with The Shab al-Hiri Roach, which, while it may look like you're playing to win, you're all just collaborating to make the story, and if anyone honestly tries to win the game, for real, it breaks down.<br/><br/>Of course, if you ask me, The Roach is more fun than those hardcore Step on up games, but it's great that there are many flavors out there, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195846/#Comment_195846" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T08:36:06+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  8:36AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of those rules are also just there to help a group of players consistently get something into the story that they're having trouble getting in a freeform situation.<br/><br/>For instance, a game that has rules for interspersing "calm" scenes with "active" scenes would allow a group to have more fun, IF that group always forgets to leave space for "calm" scenes when playing freeform.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195867/#Comment_195867" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T09:51:34+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  9:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, what Jesse said.

You say, "the outcome of the mechanics are what guides the direction of the story."  For many games, this is exactly what the designer intends; the game is built to "tell" a particular kind of story, and so the mechanics are designed to produce stories of that kind.  <i>Capes</i>, for example, is designed to produce stories about superheroes and villains and the things that drive them.  Thus, supers are assigned Drives, and the players are forced through the mechanics to decide which Drives are most important to the characters they make.  Those Drives get actively used in the game mechanics, and the narrative that is based on the mechanics should reflect that.<br/><br/>Mechanics can also guide story in more specific ways.  For example, the system of "raising stakes" in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> defines a progression of "levels of danger" (for want of a better description) -- from verbal arguments at the low end, to fisticuffs, to hand weapons, to guns at the high end.  This guides the narrative that is produced in a particular way.  For <i>...and cast no shadow</i>, I want a different kind of progression, so I've defined physical stakes as the lowest level, with mental stakes next, and spiritual stakes the highest.<br/><br/>1(b).  Why not just tell a freeform collaborative story?  In addition to the mechanics guiding the type of story that's told, mechanics can provide both a means of resolving differences about what should happen, and can inject a random element into the story, taking the players to places they might not have gone on their own.<br/><br/>I've played a lot of freeform email RPGs.  People have differences over how the story should go, and they have them often.  Mechanics can answer questions like "does Tina fall in love with Joe or Kyle?" just as they can answer "Did Joe's sword swing hit Kyle?"  Further, freeform RPGs can become boring if no one does anything unexpected.  Introducing a random element through the mechanics can take the story in interesting new directions.<br/><br/>2.  A lot of things.  One of the big ones is that many people feel that traditional RPGs leave too much up to the GM.  An example that often gets brought up is a locked chest -- many games have mechanics for deciding whether or not characters can open the chest -- but whether what's in the chest is what they want is left up to the GM.  In a traditional RPG, the players can succeed at every die roll, but still fail at their story goals because the GM wants them to.  Mechanics that directly influence story are one way around this.  They're also useful where you don't want to have a GM, but want all players to be equal; since there is no GM to make story decisions, the mechanics guide who gets to make them.<br/><br/>3.  Where do you want to go?  What do you think the next level looks like?  Honestly, I'm enjoying this level a lot right now....<br/><br/>And by the way -- it's not only story games that can be played without adding fiction.  I've seen plenty of people just play D&amp;D's combat system as a game for fun, without really creating any story based on it.  Indeed, doing so is popular enough that WotC created the D&amp;D Miniatures game, which is a simplified version of D&amp;D combat, minus the roleplaying / story aspects.  Going the other way, one could observe that just as you could take Monopoly and add narrative to it, D&amp;D's creators took miniatures wargaming and added narrative to it to create D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196011/#Comment_196011" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T18:10:00+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  6:10PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with a lot of what's been said.<br/><br/>As for where to go next, I'm actually swinging the other direction.

Or do you mean other games besides those two?  If you mean others, could you name them?  I ask only because there are sooooooo many games labeled "Indie" that have mechanics so at odds with each other that I'm not sure which games you're talking about and which you are not.<br/><br/><br/>Second, I'm going to demolish you're entire premise.<br/><br/>You wrote: "which is basically a set of mechanics and the outcome of the mechanics are what drives the direction of the story."  This is false. <br/><br/>(At least it's false for the games I'm familiar with, which is why I'm asking you to be specific about the game you are talking about.  Maybe there are games doing this!  I just know them yet!)<br/><br/>These mechanics do not "drive the direction of the direction of the story."  What they do is alter the fiction at hand, which in turn <i>demands</i> new creative bits of fiction from the Players.  It is the new creative creative bits from the Players that drives the fiction.<br/><br/>This is not a small point.  <i>It is the Players that drive the fiction</i>.  The mechanics simply force the Player to drive it with a narrower or limited scope: they provoke unexpected or unwanted or uncertain results; they take a stable fictional situation and make it unstable; they take a stable fictional situation and make it unstable; they take an unstable fictional situation and keep it stable; they take an unstable fictional situation keep it unstable; they force the Players to choose whether to press for what their PCs wants at increasing risk to themselves or others; they force the Player to reconsider or change the <i>fictional</i> tactics the PC is using...<br/><br/>Not all games do all those things with their mechanics, but that list is a broad brushstroke of the kinds of things the mechanics do.  In each case the Player is required to decide when to have his PC stop, or press on, or drop an agenda entirely, or create a new agenda or whatever.  In each case the Player is driving the fiction.<br/><br/>So....<br/><br/>1) We don't just tell a free-form collaborative story because some rules are very good at pressing the Players to come with bits of fiction in a specific scope that they would never have come up with if they'd had a free hand in making up whatever they wanted.  The mechanics limit the options, or establish new or unexpected options, or close options, or create dilemmas within the fiction that are compelling ("I could win this argument, but the NPC might be dead by the time it's over -- do I really want to do that?")  The randomness helps in this regard, and even, say with <i>Polaris</i>, the mechanics of negotiations between Players land the fiction in places where the Players could never have anticipated before the mechanics were triggered. <br/><br/>2) What has driven designers down this road?  Enjoyment.   Mechanics help channel decisions in unexpected ways, which gets the brain greased in ways to create bits of fiction it never could have come up with if the Players could always drive toward the solutions they conceived of off the top of their own heads.  To looks at the new circumstances the mechanics have created, and then to fold those results into the fiction at hand is a new bit of creation -- on the spot -- that no one could have conceived of ahead of time.

Sorry about that.<br/><br/>Firstly, the point you're making is embedded in a whole history of discussion. Some of it's good stuff and worth reading: a good place to start is the articles Steve linked to, especially "System Does Matter". The idea that a system <i>can</i> nudge the narrative in a particular direction is, basically, what drove indie RPGs in the direction they're going in today. (In my interpretation).<br/><br/>Secondly, as Christopher observes, Agora and Sons of Liberty may not be representative of a general trend. They're both by the same author. I haven't personally noticed the trend you're talking about: of rules that could be decoupled from the narrative.<br/><br/>By the way, could you try and answer your own question? Why don't you do freeform narrating, or tack a story on to a game of Monopoly, rather than play a roleplaying game? What do you enjoy about roleplaying games that the other stuff doesn't give you? Is it just fun to roll dice? The idea that the narrative is slightly unpredictable? If you imagine yourself actually sitting down to freeform-narrate, what would be missing?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle" title="Erik_Battle"><img alt="Erik_Battle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Erik_Battle">Erik_Battle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196076/#Comment_196076" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-07T05:05:37+00:00" title="March  7, 2009  5:05AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

(I was to the point, perhaps, but my writing load is heavy right now. I'm finding <i>to the point</i> seems to be working out rather well.)<br/><br/>My assumption was, given Erik's first post, he was the sort of person who just wanted info, was willing to engage, didn't have his ego attached to the discussion, and asked his questions honestly -- with an honest willingness to have his assumptions challenged.

Since D&amp;D paved the way for the RPGs that followed, it made sense to folks to folllow on that style and expand on it. This is neither good nor bad. It just is.<br/> <br/>For myself, my interest in games where narration is up front and "physics engine" style mechanics are largely dispensed with is simply a reaction to having played a bunch of physics style games over the years. While I tended to enjoy the knocking around with those aspects of the system, after a while I became disenchanted with the amount of emphasis they were taking up in play time, and even out-of-play time.<br/><br/>Forests and trees? Well, I was wanting to explore a forest ( usually in this case a forest based on some other fiction that I enjoyed, say Star Wars or The Untouchables), but the systems were giving me a requirement to stop at each individual tree and examine that one tree in detail before I was allowed to go on to the next, and do the whole thing over again.<br/><br/>The theory seemed to be that by examining any number of trees in a row, that, eventually, I'd have a feel for the forest I'd come to play in. <br/><br/>For me, indie games that I like feel "lumpier" in a good way. It's a bit like hiking down a trail with three or four friends. You stop and examine stuff, or take in the view when one of you says "hey, lookit that!". They tend to be games where, when a player's interest has been sparked, you can zoom in on that thing.<br/><br/>As for a comparison to freeform? Well "freeform" is a pretty loaded term anyway, which has about as many definitions as "role-playing game", and is likely to cause as many arguments. Mostly, the difference to me seems to be that there is some kind of structure that helps provide direction for indicating which player cao take the initiative to add more to the fiction, and when and how ( and often, why) another player can interrupt that to pick up or add to the fiction, and tells you what to do when that happens. With straight freeforming, there is generally a lack of clear guidelines for those issues. And that lack, under circumstances that almost certainly will arise over the course of a period of play, can be a real road-block to enjoyment of the activity.<br/><br/>Finally, indie games appear to me to put the issue of personal bias very much out in the open, in a way that more traditional designs do not. While players of traddie games know that biases are in play, there appears often, in practice, be an unspoken agreement to ignore that and act as if this was not the case.<br/><br/>Which actually can be fully functional for long periods of time and with a agreeable mix of players. It can come to a screeching halt, however, when that fragile agreement is disrupted even a bit or occasionally. Not that indie games fai to suffer this as well in practice, but the acknowledgement that biased human beings are involved rather than a GM ( with rules help) acting as a human computer-program is directing/managing play gives a decidely different feel to the thing.<br/><br/><br/><i>*This is a particular burr in my bonnet. Many types of wargames exist, some of which are as different from "mainstream" wargames mechanically as the most indilicious story-games are from D&amp;D. Actually, I'd say D&amp;D was a combo of one fairly popular mechaical form of wargame, combined with a more fringey wargaming "tradition" or "style", which goes a long way to describing why it became very popular early on with a segment of wargaming hobbyists in the pre-personal computer era.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196151/#Comment_196151" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-07T23:17:57+00:00" title="March  7, 2009 11:17PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just noodling around with the "freeform" idea, it strikes me that maybe I should bop onto a play-by-forum game and create a character and then just throw conflict and disaster at them constantly and see how people react.

I'll throw in with Komrade Bob and encourage it... and if you want a partner in crime, whisper me.<br/><br/>My experience with freeform play-by-post games of that sort is that, lacking any good way to resolve conflict, the players simply avoid it.  The only conflicts that come up are either pre-scripted ones that the players have worked out in advance, or player-to-player conflicts that are expressed through the game.<br/><br/>Second, the lack of conflict rules tends to lead to another thing -- in any conflict, the most persistent player is the one who wins.  They just keep posting, "but Joe does this..." responses until the other side gets tired of it and gives up.<br/><br/>But I've ranted about freeform often enough....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
