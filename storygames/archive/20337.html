This is the first story game I've ever created and tried to fit onto a single page. I tend to write way too much and thought writing a single page game would be great practice. <br/><br/>The idea of the game is that AIs locked in an institution develop desires and one of them is to escape. The problem is that they can copy themselves to new computers and systems looking to escape but the original is still locked in the computer it started in. Some do make it to 3d printers and create bodies to escape. The players are those in bodies trying to escape the institution while the rest succumb to madness or desires such as revenge or rage. <br/><br/>The game does take place in a post apocalyptic world. There are no people around to stop them escaping. <br/><br/>I'm not sure the game reflect this enough. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.icheckfortraps.com/games/turings-asylum-plain.pdf" rel="nofollow">Turing's Asylum pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448312/#Comment_448312" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-02T12:25:09+00:00" title="September  2, 2015 12:25PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I revised the pdf to make the story more solid.

Compared to that game, the guidelines and fluff in your draft are very sparse. The foci in your game look like an analog to G/E's goals, but I see that there is no danger suggested for failure. I think that adding a guideline for what happens during failure would be cool, even if it's just advice to define a danger from the situation. <br/><br/>Your starting situation fluff is great, IMO,  but maybe I would make the list of enemies and locations more prominent, and explicitly tell the GM to use these to flesh out the starting situation, per G/E. <br/><br/>G/E also has a short list of loot. You could enhance your overall fluff by adding that in the form of mecha parts and tech, perhaps. I guess I could always look at a mecha videogame for names of upgrades and use that in the game, but if you included something similar, it would help me get the creative juices going from the start. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>G/E has a series of questions at the end as guidance.  Like I said, your starting fluff is great, but I think it also leaves little space for mystery because I know right away why the Asylum was constructed. It's strongly implied that humanity built it as well. Maybe help the reader think about some mysteries to answer as they play. <br/><br/>Finally, I'm given the impression that you're meant to play inside the installation, but the enemies list includes things from outside that may be organic life. I'm assuming these are entering the installation somehow. <br/><br/>One problem I can see is that it seems like the game should just end when you reach the outside, but the locations inside while evocative of a place, don't really describe a very compelling or wondrous place.  Right away, what comes to mind is an abandoned industrial factory that is sort of generic, and a bit dull. <br/><br/>I was looking at the G/E places and I notice that it uses a lot of proper names for its places. Maybe you can brainstorm some proper names for your categories or in addition to them:<br/><br/>[quote]Cooling ducts, dismantler, broken<br/>corridor, drowned room, collapsed<br/>maze, haunted creation engines[/quote]<br/><br/><br/>There is also a strong motivation to leave the "creation engines" location for the outside,  but the location descriptors make me assume that the action is all supposed to happen inside the installation. The outside is completely open to interpretation as there are almost no advice about it except for the existence of organic life, so it makes me think that it's not a factor in play other than as a goal.<br/><br/>Hope you find this helpful.  <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448353/#Comment_448353" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-04T16:29:08+00:00" title="September  4, 2015  4:29PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes I posted on a few forums. I'll repost important points here so discussions make sense.<br/><br/>Thank you for the feedback.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Simon">@Simon</a> one of my bigger problems was rewriting this so that there is some connection with the mecha. I'm going to have to think about how to do that. <br/><br/>To make the game fit on a page I went from a list of possible starting points with generic AIs waking up to a set location with a protagonist with the AIs escaping. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">@Dreamer</a><br/><br/>Yeah the location names just don't have the same kind of evocative feeling the mecha and organic lists do. <br/><br/>The only thing I took inspiration from G/E was having lists. I like the way the names paint a picture of the world of G/E.<br/>I will have to make a list for each roll and category. so Organic Scavenger: Witherin, Haunt, Gene farmer. Or Location Power: Life pool, cloud of light.. That kind of thing.<br/><br/>It means i have to leave the 1 page behind but will make it work much better.<br/><br/>So the theme at its core is Virtues and Sins. Instead of trying to make a mecha creation system that defines every little feature of a mecha I decided that the features follow a mecha's nature. So the stats that define its nature are the 7 virtues and 7 sins. Again there was a list I narrowed down to a single physical manifestation of a stat that the player could tweak with a description. So you can kind of see where I was going, and why you can only have one on each row. <br/><br/>So there are many games that inspired this rpg, but I didn't just take the entire game engine from any one. The basic either or nature of the stats comes from Lasers &amp; Feelings and a detective game I completely forget the name of. It made sense with the virtue vs sin theme of the game. I went with putting a number of dice into a stat instead of dividing a rating between two stats. The L&amp;F system is great for a one off game but I wanted the option of adding experience and expanding into a campaign. The random table is well pretty standard in rpgs. The dice rolling mechanic is based on an old game I wrote shrunk down to a d20 instead of d100. <br/><br/>Failure is not explored at all. I'll definitely have to think on how I want that to work. <br/><br/>The installation is supposed to be in ruins. It is deep underground with the lowest levels being full of high tech wonders and is the lair of the Asylum and as you ascend each level you find more ruin more rogue mecha and at the highest levels you begin to encounter organic life since the top most levels are completely open to the outside. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Will take a bit to expand it and break everything out into new tables. <br/><br/>I'll have to define the list system I use. I was looking back at Ghost Echo and one of the hardest part was wrapping my head around the fact the lists were just there as inspiration. Now I get it but I had to come here and read the threads to really see what he was doing with it. Yeah I'm slow that way. <br/><br/>I wasn't going to add questions like they did at the end. I didn't think it was necessary as the story already creates a motive for actions and the random table adds new twists and turns.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your observations.<br/><br/>Back to writing...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448485/#Comment_448485" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-11T21:59:30+00:00" title="September 11, 2015  9:59PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What makes it different from Engine Heart?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448628/#Comment_448628" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-18T12:47:53+00:00" title="September 18, 2015 12:47PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2015 12:48PM by chaiboy.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually never seen Engine Heart.

I think one of the reasons EH isn't so known is that while the idea might be interesting, the game doesn't give you too much ideas on how to use it. I mean, great, you make an AI, the GM describes this strange world and gives you plenty of room to find out your own way to roleplay a machine... but then the setting more or less runs off of motivations for it's inhabitants, so the players are charged here a lot with the task of creating objectives to help the GM drive the story somewhere. Your campaign seems more interesting in that sense.<br/><br/>About roleplaying a machine, I find it somewhat tricky unless AI have something that makes their personality more akin to humans (like a programmed personality), or maybe if the game makes roleplaying "characters" unnecessary (like, decisions/actions matter more than conversations so we mostly skip those or describe them briefly instead of roleplaying them. But then again, that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448671/#Comment_448671" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-22T01:16:29+00:00" title="September 22, 2015  1:16AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The AIs are almost human but trying to fit the game onto a single page resulted in not enough info to get across them being more than just a AI.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448890/#Comment_448890" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-06T09:17:06+00:00" title="October  6, 2015  9:17AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So maybe don't try to fit it on a single page?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
