So here goes. Picking up from here Filip left off:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnyhilate</cite>Probably this also stretches to other types of content, but for some reason, I'm not concerned about the relative lack of good games that handle Mormonism or chivarlic tragedy.</blockquote>\nWell, I think there's just a dearth of anime RPGs overall, much less good ones. I can't think of any other genre* where such a huge portion of the list of published games is mostly stuff that's out of print, which is especially incongruous given that there's such a huge fan community, and that community has enough of a minority of gamers (and potential gamers maybe?) that most American anime cons have a decently active tabletop gaming room.<br/><br/>On the other hand, about the only anime-themed game that got any real traction was BESM, which is very much a "System Doesn't Matter" game, that went from being free-form with a 2d6 roll-under rule to a wannabe GURPS over the course of three editions. It's hard to what kind of market forces were at work, considering that Guardians of Order started off with traditional RPG distribution, then was getting into major bookstores, then completely went down in flames. Given that BESM/Tri-Stat was by far the most successful "anime" RPG, we definitely aren't dealing with a demographic that puts a lot of import on the "game" aspect. However, that may be simply due to most of the combination anime fan/gamers out there being pretty mainstream in their tastes. The RPGs I most often see played at anime conventions are D&amp;D and Exalted, and while you'll probably see more BESM and TFOS there, we're basically talking about mainstream gamers with otaku tendencies. Preferences, the influences of various subcultures, and just plain lack of exposure to other kinds of games are all potential factors, and the only data point I have is that a lot more people bought copies of Maid RPG because they heard about it from places like 4chan and Gaia Online than the conventional RPG sources, indie or otherwise.<br/><br/>The Japanese market is a little different partly because Japanese fans by and large don't think of "anime" as a distinct category the way Westerners do. In an interview someone asked me if Maid RPG's anime-style art was typical of Japanese RPGs, and my response was that pretty much everything remotely geeky in Japan is in what we would call "anime-style." Video games, light novels, anime, manga, TRPGs, etc. all have that general style, and there are parallels with live action stuff too. Japanese RPGs seem like they have a lineage that goes back to Sword World (Japan's answer to D&amp;D), while for the color designers draw inspiration freely from whatever strikes their fancy. For example, Alshad ff lists among its inspirations: Nibelungenlied, Trinity Blood, Elemental Gelade, Negima!, Fullmetal Alchemist, D&amp;D3.5, Arianrhod, Sword World, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Star Wars, Gundam Seed, and Dragon Quest. Licensed games are also very rare there (and mostly done with bland universal systems apparently), and the "X with the serial numbers filed off" phenomenon seems largely unheard of too. That's probably in part the thing with Japanese trademark and copyright law, where fan publications can blatantly use characters for hardcore pornography if they want, but a copyrighted work will avoid showing the name "Sony" on screen by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Part of the lack of anime-influenced RPGs may simply be that we haven't yet seen the generations really influenced by this stuff come to their own just yet. It took a while for artists like Svetlana Chmakova and Bryan Lee O'Malley who have manga influence but are neither rare pioneers (like Adam Warren or Fred Perry) nor slavish imitators.<br/><br/>(Also, I really need to get off my ass and work on my own games. A lot.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183728/#Comment_183728" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T12:37:02+00:00" title="December 16, 2008 12:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neko, I'm having a hard time approaching this conversation because I don't know what an anime RPG would be. So, you have an anime like Lodoss War and I'd say there are games that cover that genre. But what about something like Battle Athletes Victory? Sports comedy/drama is definitely unexplored by western games, but is it because it's anime? Or is it because that genre doesn't really map onto the types of fiction we tend to look at? <br/><br/>That's the thing that's always confused me in discussions about anime games, since it seems like a clumsy way of grouping together a vast group of totally different things that are lumped together because of their medium more than because of any similarities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183752/#Comment_183752" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T13:30:47+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  1:30PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the need to clump everything together is a big part of what's been holding back "anime" games in the first place. When I ran a session of Maid RPG at Gen Con in 2007, I told the players afterwards that I hoped to bring it out in English, and one of them said that if it didn't, she'd have to use BESM for maid stuff instead. The idea that a system with the word "anime" on the cover is necessary just floors me. It seems obvious that if someone says, "I want to run an anime RPG campaign" or "I want to write an anime RPG," the first question you ask them would be, "What kind of anime, specifically?" There certainly isn't anything unique about anime that you could encode into RPG rules, doubly so if if we try to generalize into the whole medium. For off the shelf games, depending on the type of anime, you could easily arrive at Risus, Savage Worlds, or PTA as your system of choice.<br/><br/>Considering that there have been maybe a dozen recognizably anime-inspired RPGs put out in the West, yet my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anime-Encyclopedia-Japanese-Animation-Expanded/dp/1933330104/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229462835&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">The Anime Encyclopedia</a> is an 800+ page monster (with very small print), I feel pretty safe in saying that there's a lot of unexplored territory, and disproportionately so compared to fantasy or superheroes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183863/#Comment_183863" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T02:25:20+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  2:25AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best games that I'd consider "anime games" have been some drafts by Ewen himself. BESM and OVA and such are all awful, and fail to capture anything I'd find remotely interesting. This might not mean that they're not anime, but I do like my share of Japanese culture, so at least those games fail to speak to the things I find interesting in Japanese animation. Panty Explosion is relatively passable in this regard, I guess.<br/><br/>Also, it's completely ridiculous to try to make an "anime rpg" as some sort of general thing. The absolute best one could achieve would be something like Primetime Adventures (the Finnish version of which is quite explicit in recommending the game for anime-style series, too). Comparing the number of anime rpgs to the number of fantasy rpgs is likewise a bit wrong-headed, as all anime pretty much fits in <i>some</i> genre that is in turn covered by some rpgs. Pretty much the only genre that's underrepresented in rpgs but common in anime is urban fantasy without prewriting the game into some ultra-complex setting (read: Whitewolf). Something like half of all anime that gets any traction in the western hobby scene seems to be urban fantasy genre-wise (categorized as boys' or girls' adventure anime in Japan, incidentally), but there are relatively few games that do very well with the high-concept style of urban fantasy in those games. A game that worked well with a high-concept setting like "there are magical dolls and now you own one" or "one day you got transformed into a girl and now have to live with it" or "here you go, have a book that lets you kill people without leaving a trace" would be pretty close to the core experience of much anime, sort of. I'd recommend Mortal Coil, except it is aesthetically so very, very western that it'd be more trouble than it'd be worth to try to animize it.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious that an "anime rpg" needs to conform to the anime aesthetic in the details, too. I've played several successful sessions of the Mountain Witch with anime flavour, going as far as filling my demo set with anime art to market the game as "the choice for an anime samurai epic". There is nothing in the rules of the game that particularly prevents imagining the color as anime-style, after all. Something like <i>Samurai Champloo</i> (a popular, relatively recent anime) could easily be interpreted as a Mountain Witch campaign. Same for <i>Samurai 7</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183864/#Comment_183864" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T02:27:18+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  2:27AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>A game that worked well with a high-concept setting like "there are magical dolls and now you own one" or "one day you got transformed into a girl and now have to live with it" or "here you go, have a book that lets you kill people without leaving a trace" would be pretty close to the core experience of much anime, sort of.</blockquote>\nAlthough I also thought of Mortal Coil at first, I have to admit that all those examples read like Sorceror to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183865/#Comment_183865" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T03:06:12+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  3:06AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh. Quite so. Here's more, let's see if there's some obvious connection:<br/>"There are death gods out there, fighting an invisible war to keep demons at bay. Now you're one of them, even though you're alive, and they hate you for it."<br/>"You know how to go into a magical land that has lots of different beasts in it. You befriend some and learn to take them to the real world, but now others are doing it, too, and they have more in mind than fun and games."<br/>"You were dumped into a magical spring, and now turn into a girl at inopportune moments. Your father turns into a panda."<br/>"You're a magical princess reincarnated into a schoolgirl. You fight crime."<br/>"You got an android in the mail. She loves you, maybe."<br/><br/>Those are all from urban fantasy adventure anime of various stripes, picked randomly according to what popped to mind. As can be seen, they're mostly very high-concept and simple, and all feature the notion that the protagonist character is somehow special, often the only special thing in the world otherwise more or less like ours. From this viewpoint the most popular urban fantasy rpgs are almost the exact opposite with their elaborate mythologies.<br/><br/>Continuing my thinking-out-loud, though, the thing I've liked about my best anime gaming experiences has been mutual appreciation of source material. That's what I liked about Ewen's inspired moongirl game (go back to that one, it was promising) - it didn't try to capture the whole field of Japanese media, it was just an in-depth look at one narrow feature, easy to appreciate for an audience proficient in the source material. I could imagine (and have been imagining) making a similarly narrowly focused game about this harsh fascist undercurrent series like Naruto have with their child soldiers who cheerfully endanger their lives in blind service of ambition and the national flag. It'd be quite like many boys' adventure anime series.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183872/#Comment_183872" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T05:32:06+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  5:32AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only thing that struck me as interesting in BESM was the section on "anime tropes."

I too think the thing that makes anime gaming, well, anime gaming... is really flavor and tropes.  Just like D&amp;D doesn't *really* do pulp Sword and Sorcery... D&amp;D doesn't really do anime either,although a group could come along and agree at the table to explore those tropes together.<br/><br/>First, Flavor:  Hey, it is the art.  pure and simple.  While I liberally borrow from anime all the time (just look at my fantasy character's collars sometime, lifted straight from Lodoss), I don't think anyone would say my work looks very anime-ish.   And it isn't.  My own predilictions is more similar to American 30s and 40s illustrators crossed with a healthy dose of..oh... Alan Davis, english comic book artist.  No one would ever hire me to do an Anime RPG.<br/><br/>so, an anime RPG better be drippiing with really good anime/manga art.... like Weapons of the Gods nailed the comic wuxia world it was named after by using reprints from the actual comic.<br/><br/>But flavor is SOOO freakin important in these games.  Are mecha there?<br/><br/>Tropes:  Tropes need to be reinforced by system in play.  Look at Sword and Sorcery, it is usually lone hero (Conan, Eric Stark, Tarzan) or duo (Fahfrd, Gray mouser, Elric and Moonglum, Elak of Atlantis and drunkard Lycon).  <br/><br/>Now, look at anime:  Most often, it seems to me, there is the Main character surrounded by colorful cast of Support and back up (Bleach, Naruto, Witch Hunter Robin, 12 Kingdoms, Inyu Yasha , practically any Gundam).  The lead is often "Special", something about him, her places him in harm's way, yet has hidden talents that must come out during the story.  THAT trope has to be nailed.  Some kind of scaling reveal about talent and power.  Systems that reward pluck and persistance are a must.  The support cast must be rewarded for playing 2nd banana roles... I'm looking towards White Hat rules in Buffy who get more Fate, Hero points to play with than the Slayer. (I don't remember what those points are called.).  Note, sometimes the 2nd bananas are MORE powerful than the main character, but are hamstrung from taking the reins of the story in some fashion.  Sasuke is more of badass than Naruto for much of the series...and it is telling when Naruto passes him by.  <br/><br/>Then we have the team concept:  Samurai 7, Record of the Lodoss War, Voltron, maybe even Cowboy Beebop, certainly Samurai Champloo.... everyone seems to have a spotlight episode or two.  This is more closely atuned to the usual D&amp;D party and feels a bit more even.  Some characters tend to be a bit stronger in how much we invest in them... and often, someone needs to die for the story to be pushed forward.  But there is a even handness to how much we get to know these characters.<br/><br/>Then there are exceptions, certainly the main character of Black Lagoon is powerless in a world of blood and bullets, but his business and people acumen pay off in strange, funny and really substantial ways.  Last Exile is typical hero journey stuff of two kids thrust into a huge world of steampunk flying battleships and napoleonic tactics and sense of how war is fought.  Last Exile, it is anime because the world is SOOO freakin fun and cool.  Much of Miyazaki's work is hero journey stuff and again the visuals make it so imaginative and fun, while the heart of the storytelling and characters make it so fun to watch (IMO).  <br/><br/>So.  I don't think one can really nail that last category down, the exception category.  Unless you devoted an entire book to the world of Last Exile... it is a setting that shouldn't be bolted onto a generic can-do-any-Anime RPG.  Nor Nauusica or Gundum or 12 Kingdoms.  These are worlds with deep mythologies and are very different than what we have in western rpg settings.... sure, you can do Gundum with Mekton Zeta RPg, but not Battletech.  Mekton is a direct homage to Gundam probably  more than any other mecha anime (beam saber anyone?).  12 Kingdoms divine rule is so odd and delved into, and colors EVERYTHING in its world, it really needs to be its own setting book.  <br/><br/>But I would argue that Mekton could run Gundam, it isn't as good as it could be.  Nor should it, it is a 20 year old game.  We've come a long way in RPG-game theory in the last 10.  A Gundam rpg needs to have rules for child soldiers falling in love.  And how a "special" pilot blows the doors off of the norms.  Those are pre-reqs for a Gundam game IMO.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll shut up now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183905/#Comment_183905" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T08:46:10+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  8:46AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is long, so I've got to break it into a few parts. I really do need to get an Editor or something...<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I have a number of thoughts regarding this but it's rather difficult for me to specifically address them to any one person, so I'll just ramble here a bit.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I apparently am one of those dirty "traditional" folks that play rpgs. Sure I like, own, and even run a decent selection of small press / "indy" games, but from the discussions I see, it seems clear that what I like and am interested in has little overlap with folks here. *shrug*<br/><br/>Anyway, "anime" seems to me to be just as much of a niche thing as rpgs are. From what I've seen, if you say "rpg" you're going to get one of three responses:<br/><br/>1. "Huh?"<br/>2. "Oh, you mean like Diablo"<br/>3. "You mean like World of Warcraft"<br/><br/>However, if you say "Dungeons and Dragons" (chances are "D&amp;D" isn't enough) _then_ you'll probably get some people that "know" (have a very vague clue) what you're talking about. It's going to be really vague though.<br/><br/>Anime seems to occupy much the same space.<br/><br/>There's a chunk of people that think there's "natural overlap" or something in terms of rpgs and "anime". I think a fair amount of that simply comes from lumping the all the unpleasant stereotypes under the general "nerd" or "geek" interest category and being done with it.<br/><br/>The "overlap" though is largely imaginary. That's not to say that there isn't some, just that it's really not a "significant" amount.<br/><br/>Just like you can find a fair number of PnP rpg players that play videogames in general and something like World of Warcraft in specific. But if you start "in game" and find out how many people playing an MMO actually know anything about D&amp;D or other roleplaying games, the number is extremely small.<br/><br/>Each of the geek niches has a dominant aspect. RPGs it's fantasy, MMOs it's WoW, Videogames it's probably GTA or Halflife 2 or Guitar Hero/Rockband (system dependent), non-windows its the Linux geeks, comics it's Supers.<br/><br/>Whether it's "right" or not, people think of "anime" as a whole thing. It's like saying "Drama" or "Action" Shorthand to sort of describe a big ol' collection of... stuff.<br/><br/>I personally would say that 8 Mile, Legends of the Fall, and The English Patient are fairly different movies, but they're all lumped under the term "drama". Yes, I realize that "anime" covers a wide variety of actual genres, but it still doesn't change the fact that for most people they hear "anime" and that's just a category.<br/><br/>If you talk about anthropomorphic animals and rpgs around some place like say... oh, how about rpg.net, you're going to wind up with a decent chunk of people that start great flames about how much they hate "furries". Talk about it to more casual rpgers and you'll probably get something along the lines of "You mean like TMNT?" Non-rpg people you're going to have to go for something like Charlotte's Web, Watership Down (old) or Redwall (newer), something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183906/#Comment_183906" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T08:47:11+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  8:47AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pt 2<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Personally?<br/><br/>I am so bored to fucking tears with the whole "anime" and "rpg" thing. Any time this stupid topic comes up, it boils down to a bunch of people sitting around talking about all the different kinds of anime there are. Sometimes, you'll get people like Eero that apparently loathe just about every attempt there's been to do an "anime" game. Just like so many people loathe the attempts that have been made at "generic" games and want something that really focuses in and "captures" or "embodies" the specific pet subset of whatever game type you happen to be into.<br/><br/>No Eero, I'm not trying to be a dick you just happened to express an explicit qualitative judgment so I'm using you as an example.<br/><br/>Does D&amp;D capture/embody "fantasy" roleplaying? For some folks, sure. Different editions of D&amp;D are also going to be capturing different types of fantasy roleplaying too. Does Call of Cthulhu capture/embody "horror"? Does Traveller embody "Science Fiction"?<br/><br/>People seem to miss the fact that there needs to be a "gateway" product (for lack of a better term) to get people into something. Some folks start with D&amp;D and grow tired of it. They like roleplaying games, but they want something more. So they go looking. They might stay "mainstream" they might venture into the small press or "indy" side. Whatever.<br/><br/>If the community of roleplayers that also happens to like different animes of genre want people to be interested in branching out into their particular sub-niche, make it attractive to do so in the first place.<br/><br/>Instead of crapping all over the generic systems (of which there are damn few) of "anime", make sure there's games out there that answer/speak to the particular genre you like in the first place.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is different from Ghost in the Shell. But to the person with limited experience, they're not going to be drawing many distinctions. Actually, I suppose "Lion King" and "Howl's Moving Castle" are probably closer analogies. But my point still stands.<br/><br/>Does anyone here _really_ show up and start crapping all over D&amp;D or Gurps and what pieces of crap they are to people that aren't already a member of this particular sub-community of rpg players? Well... I'm sure there's a few. But ok, let's say you do go off on a tear and start harshing on those games and call them pieces of crap. What then? Well, chances are you've got some pet system that you think is the greatest thing since sliced bread and answers what _your_ particular vision of an action/sci-fi/fantasy/whatever game is.<br/><br/>Ok, so BESM and OVA are pieces of shit. Show me the wide range of choices that speak to being a game that "looks" anime and deals with one of the various genres you'll find under the "anime" category.<br/><br/>Let's see....well, Maid is the only one that occurs to me right off the bat. And that's a pretty new one. Are there a lot of "anime" shows featuring maids? I dunno. I guess I've come across one or two, but certainly nothing that springs to mind. Maybe Big-O qualifies.<br/><br/>What game is it that's answering Ghost in the Shell? Dragonball Z? Elfen Lied? Naussica? My Neighbor Totoro? Howl's Moving Castle? Vampire Hunter D? Rurouni Kenshin?<br/><br/>Those are just the names that occur to me right off the bat that are lumped under "anime". Sure, you've got a d20 Slayers and a few other licensed bits that GoO had. Of course, people that are fans of the particular show usually dislike the system(s).<br/><br/>But it's not like there's a lot of choices out there in the first place.<br/><br/>What's gotten indy / small press rpgs to the point that they are, is in part a fair amount of failure from established companies. Companies that sank tons of money into various games and failed. Went bankrupt. People lost their jobs. Some left rpgs entirely. Slowly, out of all this failure, ideas began to emerge. People thinking seriously about what they like and don't like and why.<br/><br/>Now, there's a small but seemingly fairly stable niche of small press / indy rpgs out there. There's still the mainstream companies putting out stuff that's changed the minimum amount necessary for the past 30 years.<br/><br/>I'll also note that the fact that they've been able to keep on as they have, with minimal changes, means that they're answering enough of a need. If small press / indy games were the answer to everyone's rpg needs, they wouldn't _be_ small press, they'd have become "mainstream".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183907/#Comment_183907" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T08:47:38+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  8:47AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pt 3<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Right now, with the small press side of rpgs going the way it is, _some_ of that cycle of failure is able to be skipped. But if you really want people to stop looking for an "anime" rpg and start playing games that tell stories that are shown in the anime style... there's going to have to be alternatives in the first place.<br/><br/>And there's going to have to be failure. Time and money lost.<br/><br/>It's kind of like in the movies, when the guy is standing there with a gun and holding off a lot more people than the number of rounds in the weapon. "Who wants to be first?" is the question he asks or something along those lines. Nobody in the crowd wants to be the guy that's gut-shot and dies, just so that somebody else can get the glory of beating down the hero.<br/><br/>Licensed settings really doesn't seem to be the way to go generally. You'll have a small group of people that like it, but often what's happening is the licensed property helps to frame a setting and style of story that the participants like. In other words, while there are some folks that like the idea of playing Mal (or Jayne) from Serenity/Firefly, what the majority of people like is the kind of story, banter, and all that other stuff that goes along with the show. It seems reasonable to expect that if you pick up the "Serenity" game, you're going to be able to evoke that same sort of thing. Whether or not _you_ think the game answers that doesn't really matter. People are buying the game because that's what they want.<br/><br/>Uresia: Grave of Heaven. You might not like either version of the rules, but it's written more as a sourcebook to playing a particular type of game. Honestly, you can take either version, strip the rules out, and run the setting using your pet system. But S.John Ross really seems to go out of his way to highlight the specific things in the game and talk about ways of tuning it to match a more serious or silly game.<br/><br/>Like it or not, something like OVA or... well, probably not BESM since the GoO is out of business and people want in print games and supplements... maybe something else, are going to be the generic gateways. And while some people are going to hate the idea, that generic gateway? That's going to be enough for some people. They really are going to be fine with it.<br/><br/>"Anime" rpgs are a niche of a niche hobby. People that want tightly focused games? Those folks are a niche of a niche hobby.<br/><br/>Anime+rpg=boring pseudo intellectual arguments online. It's just like rpg theory. RPG theory (in my book) is only useful as long as it actually manages to _make_ something happen. Something very specific. Something that's actually taking place in a game. I don't give a crap about GNS or whatever. I care about the outcome of all that mental masturbation. Games like Donjon, Shadow of Yesterday, Trollbabe. Yeah, the intellectual stuff had to happen in order for those games to come about, but the point was to _make a game_.<br/><br/>Any time "anime" and "rpg" get talked about, the point doesn't seem to be to actually make a game, it's just another round of spinning tires in the mud.<br/><br/>And no, I'm not volunteering to step up and do a game that answers this. I pick and choose amongst the games I have for the themes/stories I want. I don't feel there's a lack of "anime" games out there (and I've got OVA and BESM both). I _am_ working at a PDQ thing that I'm hoping to get "anime" style art for and is all about action and all that but it's not an "anime" thing in my head.<br/><br/>Ummm... I'm not really sure how to finish this. Reading back over, it seems like I've got a bit of a hostile/agressive/upset tone. I'm really not feeling any of that. It's just... I dunno... it seems like it's the same old thing. Maid came out. Groovy. I have absolutely no idea who I could play it with, so I haven't bought it. Is Maid an "anime" game? Being the unwashed, knuckle-dragging, dirty "traditional" fellow that I am, I'd say "yes". I just think there's little point to the whole "anime rpg" discussion unless there's actually going to be _something_ at the end. Rune Soldier (Magical Soldier Louie) using something like Donjon. Not a Donjon hack or conversion; a game that speaks specifically to running an action-comedy-fantasy game like that and a setting that evokes those themes. Or Slayers, or _something_. There needs to be a variety of the "anime genres" represented and there needs to be a variety of systems that try to answer the particular pet peeves of different rpg players.<br/><br/>Sooooo.... yeah, not pissed off. Just... not caring? I don't see the point in caring? The lack of any games that seem to be trying to answer the "need" for some sort of "anime" rpg seems to me to be a bigger concern, you know? Yeah, a Porche is a hell of a lot better than than a Model T. But you've got to _have_ a Model T and convince people of the need for cars before you can get to producing the Porche. If that makes any sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183921/#Comment_183921" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T09:40:08+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  9:40AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that is a whole lot to digest.<br/><br/>My thing is basically that I'm not and have never been a "big picture" kind of guy. I can try to make guesses about that kind of thing (which I did above), but I'm mainly motivated by what I think will be fun to do with my own gaming group, and what I personally want to try. I'm very much looking forward to finally getting around to playing Bliss Stage, and I would love to see more such games. That kind of thing. While I have strayed into attempting to talk about the big picture stuff, I'm really more concerned with the personal creative side of things.<br/><br/>To me, anime just has a lot of unexplored frontiers for RPGs. There are plenty of others outside of anime too, and even within mainstream-ish genre fiction there's still a good number of new things left to try. That's the important thing. There are all kinds of neat games that could exist, but don't. Some of that is because of the overlap in fandoms not being as big, some of it is because I've been lazy about working on my own projects. If I finished everything I've started, I think about 3/4 of the anime genres I want to see in RPG form would be available. If anything, this thread is getting me inspired to get to work on that stuff.<br/><br/>Storn, I think you largely have the right of it. Short of something like <a href="http://gandygames.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">Matthew Gandy</a>'s Seiyuu game (which is apparently an anime-flavored love letter to PTA), an "anime" RPG is simply one that has elements drawn from anime. The devil is in the details as far as figuring out which tropes and such you want to encompass and how, but that's the case with anything you might do with RPGs. As much of an anime fan as I am, I'm increasingly against the notion that it is a separate, discrete category. I have the feeling that Christopher is right when he explains why Western fans see it as such, but I think that anyone who wants to engage it creatively needs a more objective approach. To me that means both seeing anime as one medium among many that we can freely draw inspiration from (as the Japanese seem to) and being fiercely critical about what you actually want out of a game (as Filip does, and more people should).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Scurvy_Platypus</cite>It's kind of like in the movies, when the guy is standing there with a gun and holding off a lot more people than the number of rounds in the weapon.

I wasn't writing as the producer of the future hit anime game, just as a consumer who got bored out of his skull leafing through OVA some time back. I'm sure the masses have great fun with games like that, but I couldn't see any redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>Still writing as a consumer with a passing interest in anime, what I'd like to see would be some games that capture some of the specific themes that are unique in anime. I can do the anime color until my eyes go round themselves, and the game's rules will have little to do with it, but give me a game that does something new and different, and I'm all over it. Like <i>Bliss Stage</i>, it's actually a relatively good example of this sort of thing, as it depicts teenagers in the sort of emotionally and erotically vulnerable position we associate with anime so strongly. There was no anime color in it when we played (it was more extremely, grimly realistic then), but everybody certainly recognized how the game originates in the interface of anime and American culture.<br/><br/>Regardless, I'm feeling no particular inspiration to start working on an anime game myself at the moment, so I guess that closes me out of a discussion where the purpose is to put up or shut up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183932/#Comment_183932" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T10:22:01+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 10:22AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnyhilate</cite>TL;DR</blockquote>\nThen <b>SKIM</b>, bitch!  w(^o^)w<br/><br/>(I skimmed, and got some decent stuff out of it.

That is, Marvel Superheroes was one of the first games I played because I liked Marvel comics and figured I'd like a RPG about Marvel comics.  Mostly, though, despite some retro-cool that I feel looking back on it, the game kinda sucked.  Sure, it like had descriptors for stats before Fudge but it was not especially fun to play.  If there was fun, it was something we basically made on our own.  I view BESM and OVA similarly, though I only have passing familiarity with them.  Sure, they may bring in a few folks or entertain folks already interested in anime, but they don't really do much on their own.  Most of the fun there is being generated by the play group, not the game.<br/><br/>And if I wanted to play, like, uh, <i>His and Her Circumstances</i>, say, how would I do that in BESM or OVA?  I have no clue.  It seems really silly to stat up characters and have them roll to compete to be valedictorian and stuff.  The ways that "generic" games do things (which isn't at all generic or universal, really) don't have anything to do with what's important about <i>His and Her Circumstances</i> or a lot of other kinds of anime (or different media).  Instead, I would probably want something that approached characters and character development and scene framing and the like really differently.  What does it mean to constantly cut to pictures of faucets?  Something!  I might even want a "faucet" on the character sheet that could either be on, off, dripping, etc.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure where I'm going there, but I just wanted to throw that out there.  Honestly, I feel like anime fans (and the fans of any genre, really) are ill-served by generic games that offer them little more than the opportunity to collaborate on freeform fan-fic in real time, mediated by rules that don't really support them in any way.  Maybe it makes for sense for certain genres of anime, but for everything?  Definitely not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184046/#Comment_184046" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T20:12:22+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  8:12PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Honestly, I feel like anime fans (and the fans of any genre, really) are ill-served by generic games that offer them little more than the opportunity to collaborate on freeform fan-fic in real time, mediated by rules that don't really support them in any way.

What they want is to collaborate on realtime fanfic, and the rules are mostly there as descriptors that act as a subtle check on "god-moding" and a prompt for when they're stuck.<br/><br/>An awful lot of the anime audience (a lot of the audience for most genre works, actually) has an essentially passive relationship with the material. They're not interested in (or particularly able at) creating anything particularly new or original - to the extent that they innovate, it's usually stuff like non-canon pairings or crossover. They want <b>more of the same</b>, and they want it to be <b>right</b> in terms of color and "canon".

The rules are thoroughly effects-based, and for the most part it's meant to be guidelines to play something a little more structured than free-form. It took me years to figure that out, and I still can't figure out why the designer couldn't be bothered to put in one or two sentences to say that.

That's exactly what you do need - at least for people who don't already have a solid social contract in place that handles benchmarking. The point-buy systems are popular for this purpose because (at least notionally) they put everybody on the same page when describing a character. This is really important to a lot of people, particularly if they want to essentially do freeform and not stop to negotiate every action's impact in the fiction. The character sheet provides a set of boundaries to character competence and style.<br/><br/>This is another version of the same psychology that results in the "no rules for roleplaying" complaint about 4e D&amp;D vs 3e. Sure, there's no actual use in having 11 ranks in Profession(Pastry Chef). But for some players, it's intensely important.

The first was just a port of an established fantasy campaign that began in AD&amp;D, in which case we were mainly valuing BESM as a "Universal Toolkit" system that was simpler than HERO or GURPS. And everyone who joined after the BESM conversion made pretty original characters, though sometimes inspired by a particular superpower.<br/><br/>But then we began a new campaign made just for BESM, which explicitly was planned to incorporate several Anime tropes. Alluvasudden half the group wanted to know, 'how do I design my favorite character from X show for this game? And we got a bunch of pastiches running around with zero to little character development.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this was a Anime-dependent phenomenon, though. It may have cropped up with any game we could've attempted with a core of inspirational material ("My character is Pal Feynolds, bitter captain!" "mine's Liver Zam, troubled psychic ninja-girl!"). But it does seem to follow your pattern, Mark, of "passive relationship with the material."<br/><br/>Not sure what that contributes to the discussion, but then the discussion's gotten weird and bewildering.

That's basically what I was trying to get at. The people who already have another functional way to get their fanfic-rp on? They're doing it, but aren't visible to us over in the TTRPG world. The only intersection with that world is the TTRPG-ers who would rather be doing fanfic-freeform, but don't know how because they're already broken by TTRPG paradigms. The movement is TTRPG---&gt;anime---&gt;anime RPG. The anime fans who are anime fans first just tend to avoid the whole TTRPG thing in the first place, because it doesn't seem like what they want.<br/><br/>Fetishization of The Character Sheet is something I only ever see in people who played TTRPGs first. People who come from fandom-first backgrounds have their own, separate pathologies - mainly a complete inability to handle actual conflict or characters who change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184139/#Comment_184139" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T12:51:45+00:00" title="December 18, 2008 12:51PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Ewen made an observation here that is perhaps the core of the issue:<br/><br/>"The Japanese market is a little different partly because Japanese fans by and large don't think of "anime" as a distinct category the way Westerners do. In an interview someone asked me if Maid RPG's anime-style art was typical of Japanese RPGs, and my response was that pretty much everything remotely geeky in Japan is in what we would call "anime-style." Video games, light novels, anime, manga, TRPGs, etc. all have that general style, and there are parallels with live action stuff too."<br/><br/>I totally agree. Anime, which is to say manga, is a style of presentation, not really a distinct genre of fiction. Fiction in Japan, when presented visually, is drawing on manga style conventions. Even in business, graphic designers create manga-style characters to hawk their products. Government too (viz, JSDF recruiting ads with cute chibi characters driving tanks). <br/><br/>So when non-Japanese gamers get on this subject, we're looking at the body of anime and manga that's coming from Japan and wanting a game that reflects the things we find in this media that are different from what we know and are familiar with. We're treating anime as a genre, rather than a lens through which we present a given genre. <br/><br/>Japanese storytelling does things a little differently than western storytelling and characterization. But we ask "where's the anime game?" when I don't really think there is one. There are only Japanese storytelling conventions that you can draw on and thus create a similar type of story, and if your visual and graphic representations of what you are doing are you playing an anime game?<br/><br/>That's what makes it such a conundrum I think. When Japanese gamers playing D&amp;D draw a picture of their character on their character sheet, I'd bet dollars to donuts it's going to look like a manga character. If their narrative elements draw on Japanese storytelling conventions, are they playing an anime game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184158/#Comment_184158" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T14:47:19+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  2:47PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does Exalted count?

And while they're using a ruleset that originates in a western culture, they're surely playing it by drawing on Japanese storytelling conventions, however different or similar they may be.

There are some fairly innovative games from the TRPG scene over there, but in that sense I don't think any are any that are as "anime" as Bliss Stage or what Seiyuu is aiming for. Japanese TRPGs just have an extremely good grasp of the attendant color. Where Bliss Stage has a lot of the underlying themes of certain kinds of anime at its very heart, the surface color is largely provided by the players. In contrast, even by Japanese standards, Maid RPG is awash in memes from otaku culture.<br/><br/>Of course, I think it pays to step away from the idea that anime is something distinct that we necessarily need to capture in the rules of the game. For any assertion we make about anime and RPGs, we should be able to make a comparable one about the relationship between another medium and RPGs. Is there no such thing as a "comic book" RPG? You can do all kinds of interesting things to factors from another genre and/or medium in RPG rules (see DarkPages), but I don't think we need to be holding that up as a requirement for the label. Superhero RPGs that are structured in terms of pages and panels are the exception to the rule, for example.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>Also, I don't think anyone has actually posited any sort of "natural overlap" between Anime and RPGs in this thread. Try addressing what people have actually said. Mostly they've said that there are precious few Anime RPGs out there, and they would like there to be more.</blockquote>\nYes. This is the major thing I'm getting at, and everything else is flailing around with somewhat related details. My concern is more that anime presents a spectrum of potential ideas for games that is largely untapped. There are lots of genres that fall under said umbrella term that are ignored or vastly underserved, and my feeling is that it isn't for lack of an audience.<br/><br/>Considering how successful Guardians of Order was for a while, and how often one sees RPGs at anime cons and vice versa, it seems pretty clear that there's a market for that kind of stuff, and one that's been kind of starved since GoO's demise to boot. From what people have said, I can accept that we won't find many non-gamers who would be willing to take up the hobby among the rank and file of anime fans. Of course, I think you could say the same thing about any other geeky subculture. Nowhere near all Battlestar Galactica fans are potential role-players, but there's that distinct niche there where the two meet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184376/#Comment_184376" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T05:33:17+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  5:33AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a feeling that I'm repeating myself, but perhaps the notion didn't penetrate on the first try: the reason that there are no Japanese "anime rpgs" is that the very notion of "anime rpg" is predicated upon the cultural interface between Japan and the west. There is no "anime phenomenon" in Japan exactly because the Japanese can't themselves very well be japanophiles invested in the genre peculiarities of something that, for them, is quite routine. This is also why an anime rpg should, to even be registered as an anime rpg, pander to the cultural interface, not the source material. If your game doesn't allow the players to engage it in the same way they engage anime, then it won't feel to them like an anime rpg.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that it's a red herring to look at the Japanese for an anime rpg when the anime experience you want to express is uniquely western. Look to the western otaku culture for the necessary context, unless you're planning to sell your game to Japan for some reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184382/#Comment_184382" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T08:24:00+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  8:24AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... I think the reason why I dislike people putting "anime" on a pedestal is that I see a tendency to insist that it need to be... I guess "pure" is the best way I can put it. People treat anime-ness as a binary state; either you're a Japanese guy making stuff for Japanese people in Japan, or you're just some stupid <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?defid=952612&amp;term=weeaboo" rel="nofollow">weeaboo</a>. That attitude has been something of an obstacle for Tokyopop in their efforts to market "OEL manga" (Japanese-style comics by English-speakers), and I now know better than to read threads on Avatar: The Last Airbender on anime forums because it will inevitably degenerate into a bunch of people decrying how it's "not real anime."<br/><br/>On further reflection I have to admit that the Western otaku culture is of course a valid and maybe even necessary context for approaching anime. (And I really want a game that explores the anime convention culture the way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramacon" rel="nofollow">Dramacon</a> does). However, so far this approach has mainly produced games like BESM, OVA, and RandomAnime. While it definitely makes sense from a marketing standpoint (I would have no compunctions about describing Maid RPG or Bliss Stage as "anime games" to Western otaku), I can't help but feel that <i>creatively</i> the Japanese perspective is useful because it helps us step back from that model and see anime as one part of Japanese entertainment media, which in turn is one part of the narrative and such available to us for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184386/#Comment_184386" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T08:43:50+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  8:43AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite>Considering how successful Guardians of Order was for a while, and how often one sees RPGs at anime cons and vice versa, it seems pretty clear that there's a market for that kind of stuff, and one that's been kind of starved since GoO's demise to boot.</blockquote>\nThis should, if one is paying attention, indicate that GoO's games did a lot of things right and shouldn't be dismissed as mere point-buy exercises.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184391/#Comment_184391" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T08:53:03+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  8:53AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other problem with Eero's formulation is that it's not actually the case. At least not in any essential way.<br/><br/>While it's true that the pseudogenre of "anime &amp; manga" as seen from the West is overly broad and doesn't describe a genre within Japanese pop culture, it's also simultaneously true that there is an identifiable genre there (well, maybe several allied ones). Anime spans a huge gamut of material, from kiddie shows to Serious Art to exploitation schlock. Manga is even more diverse. There is a core genre that nonetheless exists within it that's defined by the actively engaged fandom and peripheral creative activity, just like genre TV/comics/etc in the US. When we talk about an "anime RPG" - at least within the geeky world of fandom - it's that core genre that's in our sights. Just as Western audiences hear "superheroes" when you say "comic book", the immediate connection for Japanese <b>fannish </b>audiences is the flashy, melodramatic youth-targeted stuff. Other subgenres have their own fan audiences, but they're usually seen as distinct from the core fandom.<br/><br/>So just as a "comics rpg" probably isn't <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> or <i>Garfield</i>, an "anime rpg" can usefully be assumed to have certain genre characteristics.

Is Naruto that core, then?<br/><br/>This is interesting, because if I were to start naming elements that are really central to the western anime experience (in the sense that they are what people like and obsess about anime), shonen manga as a genre would be something like a distant fourth on my list after ecchi thematics, ambiguous sexuality and kawaii.

A few romance shows do well, too.<br/><br/>The second tier of "niche, but still widely popular" is occupied by various adventure shows - which has some overlap with the "shonen fighty stuff" that tends to be popular in the West, but is hardly identical with it.<br/><br/>Then you start to get into the real fan-driven stuff. This is the stuff that actually has a fairly small audience but that audience is highly engaged - thus, it makes money on merchandise sales, DVDs, and the like far beyond its audience share. Here you get harem &amp; eroge adaptations, giant robots and SF, horror and supernatural action, and all the wilder stuff.<br/><br/>Out beyond that are the niche-of-a-niche subgenres and pr0n.<br/><br/>The international market is weird. It's highly regionalized, for one thing. In the US, the slightly more adult end of the fighty boys shows is overwhelmingly the most popular. This is probably due to its heavy exposure on Cartoon Network in recent years. <i>Naruto </i>absolutely <b>dwarfs </b>anything else in the US market. In Europe, it looks (I haven't seen anything I'd call well-sourced data) like ecchi and adult action titles do best, but the market is just weird due to spotty localization. I'd say Europe's anime market looks like the US market did 10 years ago, before the boom.<br/><br/>So what I'd identify as the core of "fannish" anime is the second category - the merchandising-and-DVD-sales-driven shows that air in the middle of the night, that have thriving doujin communities and heavy fan engagement. But my perspective may be a bit off from the mass market even in the US - I am a fansub-watching, hardcore fan from back before any of this stuff was even on Western tv, so I see it more from within the subculture than without.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184404/#Comment_184404" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T10:41:55+00:00" title="December 20, 2008 10:41AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh. That's a very amusing description, Filip. I play a lot with anime hobbyists of a sort, as it seems that the current crop of teenagers are all manga fans. They're big on everything that gets translated, such as Naruto, Deathnote, Detective Conan and whatnot. Then when they grow up a bit they start watching anime off the 'net like everybody else.<br/><br/>When I'm thinking of an anime game target audience, I'm mostly thinking of these teenagers I play with anyway. They're not very misadapted, though, or even geeks by any internationally recognizable gauge. Perhaps I should be looking at a crazier sort of target audience to understand the purpose of an anime game? I played a long Solar System campaign specifically set in the Naruto universe a year or two ago with these local teenagers, and although half of them were absolutely ga-ga about the series and could quote the setting scripture to me as necessary, it was a very active experience in all ways, not at all like you hilariously describe. I suppose it goes to show that a person can like Naruto or other anime and still be able to play an interactive game.<br/><br/>(Yes, I'd totally design the Official Naruto RPG on the Solar System basis. It's a very natural fit in all ways, as Naruto is perfectly suited for the sort of ensemble adventure drama Solar System produces. The mechanics are intuitive, too, as Naruto runs on pool points just like Solar System heroes do. Note, though, where the animeness in this game would reside: when we played Naruto, I dealt with it just like I'd do with any Solar System campaign. I see no difference between anime gaming and other gaming on this level apart from superficial stylistical elements.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184408/#Comment_184408" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T12:01:49+00:00" title="December 20, 2008 12:01PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2008 12:05PM by Mike Montesa.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thinking on this is still cloudy, but I think it's a lot easier to design a game based on a genre that's coming through the "cultural inteface" Eero described above (good way to explain it too!). <br/><br/>So for example, giant robots. You could pin down the elements you see and like in Macross, Gundam, and Evangelion (for example), and you get a Mekton, Bliss Stage, or Cthulhuech (I'm not trying to map these rpgs to the shows, just using them as  examples of games based on the Japanese giant robot/mecha genre). You can create mechanics which support and enforce things that make those shows distinct, and which create stories modeled after the story conventions of the source material. Naturally, your presentation also resembles the source material in terms of art and graphic design (something to consider - without the visual element, as with Bliss Stage - do you still have an anime game? Do you only need the tropes or do you need the visual stuff too?)<br/><br/>Did you create a broader anime game that you could use to run a shonen fighting game a la Dragonball, or a shojo romance like Boys Over Flowers (Hana yori Dango)? I don't know, probably not, but if you succeeded, I'll pick up your game when I want to run that Macross campaign I've been dreaming about for so many years. Maybe I could've done the same thing with GURPS Mecha, but then I might be bringing the genre tropes in on my own rather than using what the system gives me. Whereas your Macross game has it all built in, and I can just roll with that and get the huge epic dogfight out of it because it's designed that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184424/#Comment_184424" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T16:58:59+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  4:58PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>It's a very natural fit in all ways, as Naruto is perfectly suited for the sort of ensemble adventure drama Solar System produces.</blockquote>\nYeah, except that every battle would be an Extended Conflict. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184426/#Comment_184426" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T17:12:22+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  5:12PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>This should, if one is paying attention, indicate that GoO's games did a lot of things right and shouldn't be dismissed as mere point-buy exercises.</blockquote>\nOK, sure. As I alluded above, I've played a fair bit of BESM, both as generic point-buy to accommodate a western-style fantasy campaign, and as a system for producing specifically anime-style stories. So, what did BESM do right?<br/><br/>Well, for starters they nailed the appeal of full-color sourcebooks for popular Anime series, with episode summaries, setting details and character profiles--regardless of any utility for roleplaying. In fact, though he was already a roleplayer, my brother first got into the Tristat books for just such this purpose, buying the books primarily as fan appreciation of the series, though he was mildly interested in their roleplaying application, too. But having Tristat writeups for Tenchi, Ryoko, etc. wasn't very useful for actual play, since we didn't really want to play a Tenchi Muyo campaign; we wanted to play our OWN stuff. Which led my bro to track down the Big Eyes Small mouth book itself, and we then started applying it to roleplaying.<br/><br/>And actually, the "mere point-buy" aspect WAS primarily an appeal. I'd bought Champions years before and never played, but I and my brother both enjoyed making characters in such a system, being able to custom-build and detail a heroic personage just how we liked it, instead of being bound by whatever Classes or O.C.C.s or whatnot a designer imposed on us. (This is the standard appeal for point-buy fans, I know. Just stating it for context.) And when we found a new group in college, BESM provided a much lighter, bookkeeping-free vehicle for that desired customizability. That was main reason our friend converted her fantasy campaign to BESM: when she'd begun it AD&amp;D was simply the available system, but she had a detailed setting in mind where magic and mythology and such works a certain way, and D&amp;D was always clashing with her desired effects. BESM allowed her to design from the ground up so that things worked the way she wanted, and allowed us the freedom in individual PC designs to do the same. My Bard, for example, finally had flexible song magic that could invoke and call up the forces he sang about, rather than being a half-rogue with a spell list.<br/><br/>The "anime color" elements were cool for us as well. The mild skewing-toward-anime of the trait and ability names (Kensei, Gun Bunny, Own a Big Mecha, Guy/Girl magnet, and so forth) were strong enough to evoke Japanese when we wanted, but without inextricably tying us to that. You could easily reenvision Kensei abilities to whatever swordfighting tradition you wanted to have, for example, and Own a Big Mecha is just a animefization of "Own a Pilotable Vehicle." And as I said earlier, the list of genre conventions in the back of the book are fairly useful if you want to play to that.<br/><br/>And of course it didn't cover, like, ALL of anime; as people have been emphasizing in this thread, that's sorta impossible since anime is so vast and diverse. They did cover "action/adventure anime in the juvenile-to-young adult range" fairly well, according to the mold of what was popular at that time. . .stuff like Tenchi and El-Hazard and Bubblegum Crisis and Sailor Moon, and some giant robot stuff. Like, if you want to build a Tenchi-type-guy or a Gundam pilot and fight it out with appropriate adversaries, with some fairly unstructured interpersonal hijinx in between, BESM's your go-toguy. But run Hana Yori Dango with it? Hell no.<br/><br/><div>*               *               *</div><br/><br/>I think the question "what did GoO do right?" provokes another question, though: "right" to what purpose? I mean, if you're talking about "right" in terms of commercial success of any kind, then yeah, seems like they were doin' all right there for awhile. Though I wouldn't say that for certain without knowing some hard data; "really popular and widespread" doesn't ALWAYS equal "commercially sound." But anyway, if we're talking about some other metric, like "useful for roleplaying purposes," then. . .I wouldn't call it use-LESS, by any means. It filled a need for me at one point. But I found it was more of a stage in development for my roleplaying preferences and understanding. It did things that other available systems (D&amp;D, mostly) at that time didn't do, and thus we were able to get some good out of it. But I look at it now and see a flabby, vague, and poorly balanced system. It's not bad as a zippy, slam-bang combat system, though I never saw much of that use since I play with gamers who "fill in" the 'gaps" in an abstract system rather than taking advantage of its light-footedness. But everything else, though there are a whole passel of "skills" that cover most tasks and interactions, are poorly defined in terms of what effect they actually have. though that's not much different than a lot of other mainstream systems at the time.<br/><br/>So, I'm not really sure what lessons we can take from GoO for present purposes. As far as the lesson of marketing success goes, we already have the Maid import as an example of raising support as an anime-fandom-artifact. So lesson learned. What about design lessons?  I mean, do we want to design another BESM? Is there a way "do BESM right" by this communities design standards, a la Solar System? Maybe. In fact, I'm hoping that Solar System might become a gradual substitute for BESM in my group, when I can get the chance to run it with them. But even if an Anime-Solar game was designed, it would only cover a certain swath of action-adventure anime. I still wouldn't use it to run a lot of genres. So we're back to the supposition that we should design specific focused games for specific genres, <i>a la</i> Bliss Stage or Panty Explosion. I don't see BESM helping a lot there.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184440/#Comment_184440" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T20:04:00+00:00" title="December 20, 2008  8:04PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2008 8:07PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not that concerned with its commercial success - I was just pointing out that in play, plenty of people loved it and still do, so it must do something right in play.

I think we're talking three different audiences, and 2 of the 3 already have the game they want, while the third never will (because they want a different game for every subgenre).<br/><br/>People who are primarily fans, who want to do some tabletop gaming in which they mostly just fool around with familiar tropes and pastiche characters in a so-loose-its-notional ruleset have Point-Buy-Game-of-the-Month. BESM, OVA, GURPS, etc. have all filled this role at one time or another and done a decent job of it.<br/><br/>People who are primarily TTRPG players who want to play a game with "anime" <b>color</b> will just use whatever system they use for everything else. If they're really adventurous, they might use a dedicated "anime RPG", but it'll still be one that follows the conventions they're used to. Again, BESM fills this role nicely.<br/><br/>People who are interested in recreating anime-like content and structure will not find any single method to suit them well. I tend to use stripped-down <b>FATE</b> when I want to do mainstream action-adventure stuff, but nothing has ever really quite hit the spot for the other genres I like best; then again, romance and comedy are poorly served in RPGs generally. <i>Bliss Stage</i> is rather off in a corner by itself here - I actually tend to think of it as not terribly "anime" except in color and play it as a war story or a romance story (or both). It actually doesn't lend itself to the overstated, Big Damn Melodrama that I associate with most anime &amp; manga all that well in my experience.<br/><br/>There's another group out there, but they don't want to play a TTRPG. They want to fic. Rules are props for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184457/#Comment_184457" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-20T23:14:53+00:00" title="December 20, 2008 11:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2008 11:17PM by Joli.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>Is there a way "do BESM right" <b>by this communities design standards</b></blockquote>\nI made this statement in the context of several people (myself included) expressing the sentiment that BESM is flawed or lacking. If you're not going to address me on those grounds, then you're quite frankly trolling.<br/><br/>You do get into some helpful territory with your suggestion of BESM's strength (zippy in play, detailed in chargen). That's a pretty good point. Personally, I don't find that it's zippy mechanics are satisfying in play, and would like a different brand of zippy, like Solar. If you'd like to make a case for their functionality, why don't you do so? Explain why you think that BESM deserves consideration, <i>by this community and in this conversation</i>, above what it's already been given. It might be a little more productive than sniping at others' considered contributions from the safety of a veiled perspective.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184462/#Comment_184462" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T00:23:17+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 12:23AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't realize we had design standards in this community!

Of course we have design standards, how could it be otherwise? Might not be the same standards for everybody, but insofar as there is any community based on solid appreciation of the rpg craft, it'd be rather weird if it was not accompanied by real expectations and communal knowledge concerning design.<br/><br/>As for BESM, I think it's a highly valid point that some people derive satisfaction from getting to model characters in point-buy systems. I can't stand it personally, though - I've been known to rave against the whole practice of point-buy in length, and one might interpret all of my work with the Solar System as a sort of transformation process from a point-buy system into something else. I just hate, hate, hate to sit down and spend two hours making arbitrary decisions that are not constrained in any interesting manner. Any point-buy system I've ever seen works for my purposes better by arranging everything in it into a table and having me roll dice for some random results.<br/><br/>However, point-buy is point-buy, so to make it work, the game should provide a firm social context for building a creative impetus <i>before</i> I have to sit down and start sorting through those power lists. If I were remaking BESM, I guess I'd preserve the point-buy and even consider some Capes-like drama structure where the whole group gets to participate in making more characters during play, perhaps somehow constrained by the events of play. Something like having your choices for the protagonist character constrain the choices made in building the rival character in interesting ways. I don't know, might be that I'm misinterpreting the motivations: is the point-buy chargen fun because it's fun to model characters into the rules, or is it fun because it implicitly blesses the player's god-given right to play exactly the fetish character he has in his head? If it's the latter, then continuing character-building after making that one perfect character is pointless.<br/><br/>Then again, if it's not the point-buy that's interesting, but the process of giving statistics for that character in your head, then the point-buy is all unnecessary overhead. Rather, consider a system that allows you to assign your character any of the mechanical powers on the list, but balances this in some interesting manner for play. What that interesting manner should be depends on what play would look like, I guess - but it seems to me that there'd need to be some constraint on that character-creation, as people seem to enjoy the thought that their characters are "balanced" and that they are not playing wish-fulfillment games (even if that's exactly what they are doing). I know how I'd make this work for a drama game, but it well might be that the BESM fan is looking for more of a "princess game", as I call these - a game where the purpose is to project your character concept (often inside your head only) and have little actual activity. I know a couple of girls around here who are like this at the roleplaying table, been considering designing a game that actually supports the princessing activity. Considering that they're also anime fans, I might have something here...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184492/#Comment_184492" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T07:52:19+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  7:52AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnyhilate</cite>Well, as much as I'm into (watching and gaming) anime, I'm not into Naruto.<br/><br/>However, most of the players I tried to recruit from anime subculture so far wanted to play Naruto-clones specifically, regardless of the game we were supposed to play.

At traditional gaming shows, I've talked to people about how I got a new comedy RPG that could rival Paranoia, and their curiosity piqued until I broke out<br/><img alt="image" src="http://maidrpg.com/index_pics/cover.jpg"/><br/><br/>You'd almost think I presented a silver cross to a bunch of vampires by the reactions they gave me.<br/>Makes me wonder if people wouldn't freak out if the cover was more "western."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184512/#Comment_184512" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T10:42:13+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 10:42AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I just hate, hate, hate to sit down and spend two hours making arbitrary decisions that are not constrained in any interesting manner.</blockquote>\nTypically the constraints in "big" point buy systems like BESM and GURPS come at the campaign development stage, which there is usually a lot of guidance on (that is what the "RPG guide to anime X" stat sections are for, remember? 'Course ya do.)  <br/><br/>I absolutely agree that this could be done better and perhaps with more transparency. A game of BESM with four skills: kung fu, yelling at your family, cooking and throwing things, is quite different from a game of BESM with twenty skills and one supernatural power - channelling the dead, is quite different from a game of BESM with ten skills and twenty different powers.  It is terrible to just toss the book in front of someone and say "make a character" - what must be done is to make a game, then make a character in that game. BESM and GURPS and d20 and the like are campaign design tools, and they do their jobs exceeding well. What we could use is more "how to build what you want with these tools" info.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Something like having your choices for the protagonist character constrain the choices made in building the rival character in interesting ways.</blockquote>\nReally, Hearts, Swords, Flowers has some of what you need here (though not quite this specifically).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184524/#Comment_184524" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T12:24:45+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 12:24PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What we could use is more "how to build what you want with these tools" info.</blockquote>\nI hear that.

I mean, if one discusses how to create a Gunslinger Girl, or Claymore themed RPG, I could understand that the discussion could get somewhere. But anime themed RPG? that sounds as hopeless as designing a Hollywood themed RPG that could cater for Aliens as well as Harry and Sally, and American Pie to boot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that the tropes are too diverse to fit practically within one system. Now one can take another approach and see what happens in real life: I might be faced with a group of potential players whose only common element is that they like anime, and want to re-enact parts of it. In that case I guess the beginning would be to explore which particular genre best fits this particular group (mahou shoujo, yaoi, shounen martial arts, etc). I think <b>PTA</b> is the best option for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the preferred genre determined, and the desired tropes identified, THEN one might look for a game, or even design one that really helps rather than hinders the game. Probably (I haven't read) <b>Maid RPG</b> is a good example of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I guess the discussion would be even more interesting if we discussed genres and how different mechanics might serve them. But probably before that one could discuss what genres are <i>at all</i> suited to be adapted to RPGs. For instance many shoujo I read are about romance and coming of age. How could you turn that into a RPG? <b>Breaking the ice </b>is one way of approaching a fraction of it, but you would be missing the typical tropes of the genre:<br/>\n<br/>\n- passing of time of seasons and its rituals, such as the festivals, Valentine's day, New Years temple visit<br/>\n- the different coming of age milestones, such as the theater play, the first year in high-school, the first kiss, etc<br/>\n- the inevitable rivals plus friends, etc<br/>\n<br/>\nA Shoujo RPG should provide those tropes, but in such a way that it still makes sense to play in a group, since RPGs are mostly social activity, BtI notwithstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which manga/anime genres would you find insteresting/feasible to adapt into a RPG, and how would you go about it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184690/#Comment_184690" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-23T08:28:11+00:00" title="December 23, 2008  8:28AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oops, looks like the discussion went forward <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8329&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">there</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184691/#Comment_184691" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-23T08:46:19+00:00" title="December 23, 2008  8:46AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alex,<br><br>The thrust of the thread so far has been that while creatively it makes more sense to focus on a specific kind of anime, BESM did just that scattershot approach and was successful at it because it does things that fit a type of player that commonly wants to role-play anime stuff.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: AlexS</cite>So which manga/anime genres would you find insteresting/feasible to adapt into a RPG, and how would you go about it?</blockquote>\nOne of my points is that although people tend to perceive it as such, anime is not a "special" category, and designing games inspired by it is no different than for anything else. Mechanics can play off of the medium (Raspberry Heaven, my Azumanga Daioh/Lucky Star style game has scenes structures after the 4-panel comics directly), the story structure itself (Tokyo Heroes, my sentai game, has sessions that go Prologue, Investigation, Battle, Epilogue, just like the shows), or encode memes from the source material (Maid RPG with its zillions of random tables is a perfect example of this).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The Strange Relationship
