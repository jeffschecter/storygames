I'm really happy with it!  This particular game was dark, dark, dark and felt very contemporary:<br/><img alt="image" src="src"/><br/>So there's Bernard, a middle-aged Christian zealot who has a bomb-making factory in the funeral home he works at, supplying abortion clinic bombers.  He's also gay.  And infertile.  So .. he's a fucking bastard with problems (played with gusto by my brother!).  His wife wants a child he can't provide.  She's already got a grown daughter who thinks she's her niece.  This "niece" runs a greenhouse and grows a little weed on the side, supplying the town through her reliable contact, a strapping 19-year-old lad who is the son of the guy who owns the funeral home.  Who is also gay and in the closet.  The fiasco is primed.  Everyone is pointed at everyone.<br/><br/>We get to play out Bernard's seduction of Rich Spiller, the gay kid, and the truly awful scene where Rich gets brought into the fold.  There first target - that cradle of filth and ungodly perversion, the town's gay hook-up spot behind the Patio theater... Rich plants the bomb that kills two of his friends, despite his strenuous efforts to sabotage the bomb.  <br/><br/>Sophie, the pot-growing niece, arranges to hook up Rich Spiller with her aging "aunt", using her knowledge of his homosexuality as well as his interest in coming into the drug dealing business against him.  Late in act two we fade to black as Elizabeth Spivey gets what she wants ... more awfulness as the lovers are discovered by Bernard, who is being cheated on by both his wife and his lover at the same time.  <br/><br/>Of course the FBI is nosing around, looking for the bomber, and Bernard loses it.  He's been betrayed, he decides that Rich "corrupted" him, and sets up him the bomb, literally.  RIch becomes an unwitting suicide bomber and takes two FBI agents with him.  At this point justice rains down, poor Sophie torches her greenhouse in a panic and loses all her hard-earned drug cash, Bernard goes to prison forever+1, and Elizabeth has a dead gay man's baby.  It was pretty choice.  <br/><br/>I just observed a four player session and it was hugely instructive - I realized a few things about the rules, and the game's flow, and how to explain that in words.  So it was very productive, and confirmed a lot of the choices I made after Dreamation.  Fiasco is approaching baked-ness.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197828/#Comment_197828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T11:48:36+00:00" title="March 19, 2009 11:48AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So awesome \u2014 the first paragraph could be a blurb for the game.<br/><br/>I thought that the self-loathing angle on Bernard was especially inspired, and unusual since we haven't see a lot of how Fiasco characters think of themselves in the AP reports so far.  Some of that is because the rules seem to concentrate on building that terrible machine, winding it up, and watching it go, and that is compelling all by itself.  But here, the group got a lot of drama out of the decision to make Bernard have a complicated relationship happen inside his own head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197835/#Comment_197835" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T12:12:48+00:00" title="March 19, 2009 12:12PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was really cool to have this buttoned-down guy become the focus.  There was a terrific scene early on where he got sent to the fertility clinic to deposit a sample of his sperm, which involved some private activity to which he was morally opposed - Onan and all that.  And my brother, playing Bernard, described him stewing in the little booth, looking at the unappealing assortment of dog-eared pornography, and seeing a copy of HONCHO at the bottom of the pile. It was just a perfect, sad moment, and that magazine ended up being important - he stole it and stashed it with his bomb-making stuff.  <br/><br/>I think if "Object:  Weapon:  Pipe bomb" hadn't been chosen, it would have been a very subtle session with a lot of pathos.

So to do that, I'm including a big replay full of table talk and examples of good behavior (people shouting out ideas, building on previous scenes, asking for help, etc) and cross-referencing it a lot, as well as discussing particular aspects (like the need to choose initial details that meet certain functional and aesthetic criteria for your group) more than i thought I'd have to.
