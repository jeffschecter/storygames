Couple of quick questions on TSOY:<br/><br/>1:  In an unopposed ability check it appears that, no matter the difficulty of the task, a result of 1 (marginal success) is enough for the character to succeed with their intent.  Is the primary balancing factor for difficulty then simply increasing the consequences of the failure, however unlikely that failure may be?<br/><br/>2:  I think I'm clear on this but just want to make sure.  All harm is recorded on the same track.  So its reasonable to assume that my silver tongued noble, upon finding himself face to face with a well trained assailant inside of BDtP, could choose to go with the parallel action of convincing his attacker to spare him.  This could lead to several rounds where the two trade harm with my nobel giving as good as he receives.  Assuming that his assailant refuses to give, I could fill his harm track up through wordplay, then at the last moment change my intent to "I kill him" (whereby I defend for one round) then finish him off with one clean stroke while he's standing there drowning in his doubt?  If that's legit, I think I kind of like it.  Unusual, but I think I dig it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138170/#Comment_138170" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T11:51:34+00:00" title="April  4, 2008 11:51AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/Resolution#Bonus_and_penalty_dice" rel="nofollow">Penalty Dice balance difficulty.</a><br/>\n<br/>\n2.

In the books example, penalty dice are added to represent <i>extreme</i> environmental hindrances and lack of tools.  Those conditions made climbing the mountain more difficult but don't speak towards the natural difficulty of climbing the mountain.  What I mean is that some mountains are considerably easier to climb than others, all other things being equal.  So is it best to just represent a difficult climb with higher consequences of failure?  Or do you just use a penalty die across the boards so that all tasks are either normal, very difficult (1 penalty), or insanely difficult (2 penalty, which no one really seems to use)?<br><br>My instinct is that its handled through the use of greater consequences.  The line in the book about it "being a giant boulder" so the consequence will be a broken leg makes me think that its simply the consequences that represent the natural difficulty of the task.  Maybe not though.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138243/#Comment_138243" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T17:52:24+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  5:52PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2008 5:55PM by Rustin.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tsoy.crngames.com/Types_of_Ability_Checks" rel="nofollow">Types of Ability Checks.</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my understanding if something is harder, then the chance of success should go down.

You should roll only in conflicts (conflict resolution), and assume that the characters are able to climb what they want without rolling anything.  The unopposed ability roll is there if there is some reason, once, to make an exception, and because it's useful to explain as it works because it returns, modified a little, in bringing down the pain with parallel actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138305/#Comment_138305" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T08:26:27+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  8:26AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only played tSoY once and it went pretty poorly for us, for reasons that were all my fault.  I say that so its clear how little experience I have as I ask these questions and make any assertions.  But I can't help it, tSoY (like Burning Wheel) is one of the games on my shelf that calls strongly to me whenever I look to bring the gaming group back together.  I really dig what its doing.<br><br>Anyway, all that said, it never really struck me that unopposed ability checks would be "very, very rare".  I realize that the best awesome probably comes from PC vs. PC or PC vs. NPC conflict.  But an unopposed ability check isn't really a no conflict situation, its just a situation where the character is in direct conflict with the story itself, and is naturally resolved through the unopposed ability check.  If my player wants to use her Fine Crafts ability to sew some cheap but serviceable garments for the town beggar so as to establish a relationship and simultaneously hit her Key of the Vow (Help the Poor), that's a significant but unopposed conflict for the story I think.  The task is also relatively simple to accomplish.  If the same character wants to sew an elaborate suit for the local baron in order to win a boon and recognition, also trying to hit her Key of Power, then that could also be an unopposed conflict for the story.  But the task would be significantly more difficult to achieve than crafting a cheap shirt and pants.<br><br/>Or would both of those examples still be opposed checks, against the beggar and the baron respectively?  Maybe they're poor examples?  It just seems that there would be plenty of opportunity for a character to try to make a narrative impact on the story while not necessarily interacting with another character.<br/><br/>Am I way off?

There's nothing wrong with saying 'If you lose this ability check writing a song for the duke, you'll take a level 5 harm in Instinct, and be banned from the kingdom.'

Why roll?<br/><br/>Where is the pathos, the drama, the turning point in the story, the crucible of different path... in someone with a Fine Craft ability that is sewing a "serviceable" garment for the town beggar?<br/><br/>Even if we talk only about plausibility (and I wasn't talking about that)...  why should someone with "fine craft" skill roll to be able to make  serviceable garment? Do tailors routinely a 10%, 20% or 30% percentage of shirts with three sleeves, trousers with only one leg, mis-matched button, or something like that that would make the end result unserviceable for a town beggar?<br/><br/>It's the same old logic of "you don't roll to open the door of your house"<br/><br/>What is the problem that make you avoid simply telling the player that he make the garment, without having to roll for it?\n<blockquote><br/> The task is also relatively simple to accomplish.

Your mileage may vary). <br/><br/>But let's make another example: there are TWO dresses, one made by the player character, the other by his bitter enemy, the other tailor who burned down his shop, envious of his garments.  The Baron will choose one, and will make the one who did it his personal tailor.  The other will be exiled from the barony. NOW you have drama, tension, and a motive to roll. But it's become a REAL conflict, so they roll one against the other, and the one who make the best roll win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138311/#Comment_138311" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T09:17:48+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  9:17AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Moreno, good points.  I realize we're drifting further and further from my original questions but I'm okay with that, as its still sort of related<br/><br/>In my examples above, at least in my mind, there's still drama and two different stories unfold depending on how the dice fall.  The drama in the roll, for me, would be that the player isn't just trying to create a serviceable shirt and pants (which I agree, they should be able to do as that's their job) but they're trying to influence the game in a real way.  One, they're trying to earn experience from a key and two, they're trying to build a relationship that takes the game in a new direction.  That's enough drama to warrant a roll in my mind.  So certainly, if by succeeding at the task the game story doesn't really change then there's no need to roll for it.  I understand the just say yes principle (thanks Vincent/Luke).  But in both of my examples I think the story is bracing itself for a new turn, so a roll is needed.  The same for the example you provided.<br/><br/>I'm also assuming that in my two examples, not only is the task for the baron more technically difficult but it could potentially have a bigger effect on the story.  In the beggar example, the task is much simpler but I also feel like the effect on the story, though important, would be less significant.  That's why I believe I'd make the consequence of failure more dramatic for failing for the baron versus failing for the beggar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138316/#Comment_138316" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T10:35:01+00:00" title="April  5, 2008 10:35AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris, consider this:<br/><br/>For the beggar, I would make it a conflict about the fine crafter getting heat from someone who wants his time for herself; for the noble it would at least be a conflict of the quality of the garb vs. the unwillingness of the noble of being impressed by some random seamstress.<br/><br/>The point I'm trying to make is that for a conflict to be meaningful and instructive regarding the development of the in-game events, someone should have an interest in conflict with the goals of the character.

Just like you can refresh pools without a Contest, though you can certainly roll to see how well you arm-wrestled or whatever.<br/><br/>2) That said, these examples are situations where you would probably want to use a helping roll to roll the successes from Dressmaking or whatever into bonus dice for an opposed "Gain the Trust of the Beggar" or "Gain the recognition of the Baron" Contest. That's where a lot of the robustness of the TSoY engine lies, and that's <i>really</i> where the meat of the conflict is, in both cases.<br/><br/>3) I do think that your instinct to set nasty stakes for mightier obstacles is right on. Losing stakes are a key part of TSoY; making failure interesting gives maximum fun whether PCs win or lose. It doesn't have to be either/or, though: you can give a penalty die or two for a titanic struggle against Mighty Caradharas. . .<i>and</i> make the consequences for failure particularly brutal. I mean, if it's really that important to the drama ("the story is bracing itself for a new turn"), then we want every outcome to have sufficient gravitas.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138328/#Comment_138328" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T13:08:22+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  1:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to derail, but this comment:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I've only played tSoY once and it went pretty poorly for us, for reasons that were all my fault.</div>\n</blockquote>\npiqued my curiosity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat went wrong and why do you think understanding these specific rules will fix it?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you blame yourself entirely?<br/>\n<br/>\n(On an aside, I've found for story/indie games to work all people at the table need to actively participate.

The task is also relatively simple to accomplish.  If the same character wants to sew an elaborate suit for the local baron in order to win a boon and recognition, also trying to hit her Key of Power, then that could also be an unopposed conflict for the story.  But the task would be significantly more difficult to achieve than crafting a cheap shirt and pants.<br/></blockquote>\nHi Chris,<br><br><br>As I read your example with the tailor and the beggar, the conflict as such is not unopposed - the player wants to do two things. One is activating a Key and the second is establishing a relationship - and that's where the conflict is. Roll against the beggar to see if a relationship is created through the creation of the garment. Will the tailor see the beggar again? Will the beggar abuse the friendship? Will he refuse to receive the gift? There are plenty of outcomes and options. The roll to win boon and recognition is likewise a roll against either the Baron or his court.<br><br>Secondly if you find the players choosing unopposed conflicts, try to consider the object of the conflict as an abstract NPC. The players wants to plunder the Dungeon, so treat the Dungeon itself as a monster. The characters are trapped in logbuilding during a blizzard and they decide to risk the weather. Then treat the blizzard as a monster (or a group of monsters that independently attack each character). The strength of TSoY is that it can handle abstract NPC's. Had the same positive experience with In a Wicked Age, where two of the most dangerous character's I've played was a Dark Wall dividing a battlefield - symbolic of the destructiveness of warfare, hence draining the PC's of their will to live - and likewise An Ancient Oak under which a pagen god lies dormant. The Oak wanted to lure people to it, bringing blood sacrifices, to awaken the sleeping god. In the same sense you could have Nightmares or Drug Abuse as NPC's.<br/><br/>In this sense there are only few unopposed rolls, as most should in my opinion be directed against NPC's or the Object of the roll should be transformed into an abstract NPC.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138390/#Comment_138390" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T07:59:07+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  7:59AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of very sweet advice here folks so thank you very much.  Its becoming more clear now that even if not immediately apparent to me that most of my conflicts actually are conflicts between two game personas and I just need to sift things around until I see it more clearly.  And I definitely like the suggestion of going with abstract NPCs as well when needed.  This discussion has actually been pretty fruitful for me, and even went beyond my initial confusion, so thanks to everyone that chimed in with assistance.<br/><br/>Rust, that's a long discussion and I spent some time at the Forge about a year ago going round and round with it.  <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19433.0" rel="nofollow">Our first attempt.</a> <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19497.0" rel="nofollow">And second.</a><br/><br/>To be clear, my questions here have nothing to do with "fixing" what went wrong previously.  I'm just looking to give it another go and wanted to make sure I understand those points about the game.<br/><br/>I say my fault because I went forward with the game despite some pretty significant red flags during the pregame discussion and character generation.  And you're right, I realized that it really does take everyone at the table working towards making the game good, and we certainly weren't all aboard yet.  There's more to this as I attempt to go forward again but that really is another discussion I'm afraid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138420/#Comment_138420" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T14:50:50+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  2:50PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2008 2:55PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is weird to me.<br/><br/>TSOY doesn't say that rolls are always conflicts of interest. It has simple task resolution in the form of unopposed rolls. The example in the text is "Pieter is going to try to climb that boulder." So, clearly, the game expects you to roll for something as simple as that. The criteria in the text for an ability check is "When performing an uncertain action..."<br/><br/>Don't worry about the abstract NPC business. It can be used for cool stuff sometimes (You fight the tornado!) but those are exceptional situations, not the norm. The text doesn't even talk about doing this at all.<br/><br/>You should have lots and lots of unopposed ability checks in a TSOY game. They are by far the most common type of roll.<br/><br/>The technique that keeps these rolls from sucking is simple: the stakes for failure are never "nothing happens." Every roll changes the situation, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Also, Fudge dice being what they are, even "unopposed" rolls are a crapshoot sometimes. The dice can go negative just as easily as positive, so there's some built-in difficulty to every roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly" title="Chris McNeilly"><img alt="Chris McNeilly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20McNeilly">Chris McNeilly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138422/#Comment_138422" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T14:57:33+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  2:57PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey John, your opinion is pretty much the opinion that I have had on the system and what you're saying is directly answering my original question.
