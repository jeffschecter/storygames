Rowland).<br/><br/>He describes different models of time you can use:<br/><br/>1 Linear Time (immutable) - no change whatsoever can take place, "the moving finger writes and moves on".  The only gains in time travel are through observation (e.g., you can see where the treasure was buried so you can go back in present and dig it up).  Not much grist for roleplaying.  Time travel really amounts to "viewing the past".  It does create law enforcement and other implications for an internally consistent setting if it is possible. [E.G. there is a short story in which a time travel inventor is approached by various religious authorities to get him to agree never to visit the time periods in which the "truth" of historical claims to their faiths would be determinable].<br/><br/>1. Linear Time (Variable) - this is where roleplaying likely happens, three types.<br/><br/>(a) Avalanche Time - minor actions can snowball, killing the butterfly in the Pleistocene era can mean that dinosaurs still rule the world in present.  There is no tendency for events to "revert".  Killing dictator stops war.  There may be particular "safe zones, paths" etc. where "as long as you stick to this it's safe" (e.g., you cannot leave the road when going through woods, you must not talk to any official in the town and you must not harm any livestock).  This kind of "short list of restrictions" can be used to create amusing/challenging scenarios as long as the consquences of "what happens if you do" are acceptable failure.<br/><br/>(b) Elastic Time - stretchy time, history reverts, question is just how long.  Killing dictator at best slows down war, war still happens and ends up much the same.<br/><br/>(c) Conservative Time - almost immutable, it's like elastic but almost immediately and prophylactically, shoot at the dictator and you miss, try to blow him up and he's called away suddenly, kill him and it turns out that was a body double and the real one is unharmed [TV stories use this a fair bit, essentially you do something to change past but it's futile].  Another version of this is "defensive time" which will eject anyone who would cause a big change (e.g., in the Avalanche restrictions models, step off the path and the "chronovores" show up to gobble you down).  In Conservative time, history as you know it was already based on all the time travel that ever takes place.  This suggests future also "determined".<br/><br/>Then there is Branched Time where changes simply create an alternative fork, Parallel Time where all possible forks happened already and there are infinite parallels, Looped Time where past and future are looped and always feeding back to one another.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Implication is that different models of time work best for different stories</span>.  If your timeline is Avalanche, any time travel can create large changes, and if you can travel back any large amount of time it's huge, history rewritten so much it doesn't count when it's made.  This works best only if time travel can only go back a few days for "recent history do-overs that will really matter" (TV shows have explored this, both as 'do overs' and 'time cop' 'time war' concepts).  <br/><br/>Conservative time is an interesting model to explore in a time travel story (e.g., you don't know yet which type of timeline is working, can you change history?) but I don't think it would work in ongoing play.<br/><br/>If it's Elastic, to notably change present you must travel back no more than a few decades (depending on rate of correction).  Changes are more relevant at personal level (saving your lost love) than "historical" (the revolution will happen anyway).  If it's Elastic with "breakable if event big enough" then you've got Time Cops/Time War stories about defending history and "repairing it" (e.g., intervening to put it back on track, which can be a problem if a new timeline 'post break' is the new 'elastically defended timeline). <br/><br/>Also, if it's Elastic you may want to ponder a bit "why" - what makes events revert to producing the same long term outcomes?  Is there a destiny?  Is there an uber time cop force at work protecting a particular timeline?  Is it benign or not?  Why does the timeline revert could be an underlying "question"/"mystery" in the campaign.<br/><br/>[I have embroidered Rowland's basic outline with the story implications and you can tweak all of these to work differently but I think they are useful categories to think about in establishing time travel]<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117340/#Comment_117340" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-01T15:44:53+00:00" title="January  1, 2008  3:44PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>Is there a way to make that work?</blockquote>\nI've been working on something right up that alley over on <a href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com/?cat=6" rel="nofollow">the Imagination Sweatshop</a>. The initial post only really hints at what's going on (more posts will be up later), but the basic gist of it is: as the characters meddle in time, the more currency they have to spend on doing all those juicy little time travel tricks (like going back in time to help yourself); but the greater the possibility of them causing a paradox that would unravel the universe. So, the future not only <i>can't</i> be changed, but they must actively avoid changing it.<br/><br/>Mechanically speaking, each time the characters try to affect history, the players must roll dice. From this roll, they will find a number that they must enter into a grid. The more instances of a single number in the grid, the greater the risk of altering history (and ending reality as we know it). If the players can make preset patterns of numbers in the grid, they gain Synchronicities, which are those aforementioned juicy tricks. As the game progresses the more time tricks the characters can perform and the more dangerous their meddling becomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston" title="MattJohnston"><img alt="MattJohnston" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cimota.com/slypic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MattJohnston">MattJohnston</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117343/#Comment_117343" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-01T16:07:30+00:00" title="January  1, 2008  4:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I blogged this:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lategaming.com/2007/09/10/i-havent-eaten-anything-since-later-this-afternoon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lategaming.com/2007/09/10/i-havent-eaten-anything-since-later-this-afternoon/</a><br/><br/>talking about my Story Game: TimeKillers.<br/><br/>"Each player must have a Timepiece, a pen and paper representation of  an electronic diary, which records their past and future.

And occasionally you get Frag which means you need to deal with something in your Yet, and if you can't deal with it, someone else will, and that's generally considered suboptimal to you fixing your own problems.<br/><br/>I would suggest just stealing that, and trying to avoid the paranoid mindset of altered memories and Thespian body-doubles that results from the vast webs of informational paradoxes that the rest of the game's model of time-travel seems like it would inevitably result in.

Basically, time is branching all the time with each possible event. Time Travel is really travelling to another dimension where you appeared in the past (or future, or whatever). From that event, creates all sort of possibilities based on the actions you take until you leave and either go to a point futhur down one of those branches where you see the effects of your changes, or possibly even back to your own time where none of the changes happened, even in the past.  <br/><br/>The problem storywise, is you can simply skip the changes and instead go to a branch where those changes were made (either by another you or even someone else entirely) to your liking. Not very exciting. So, either there's a reason for them to make changes, or their travel is not that easily fine tuned or even under their control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117540/#Comment_117540" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-02T15:56:42+00:00" title="January  2, 2008  3:56PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mean quantum in terms of actually being based on quantum mechanics.

I've been reading quantum based time travel theories, and have trouble with the traditional model used by movies and TV shows now.<br/><br/>One thing I would do for time travel rules, to get the way your saying, is in the rules of the game.  So, first, there has to be a reason for the characters to be time travelling. So, I'm going to go with the Quantum Leap* excuse is that, they're there to change something (probably for the better).  Difficulties could be established by how noticable they are at making the changes. So, checking the box for the cat is really easy if they do it in the middle of the night when their past selves were asleep. But since they're trying to effect change, then someone's going to notice something. It's up to the players to try and defuse the obstacles so they are logical to people in that time. Maybe they have a resource pool to change the facts. Like spending a point to check the box <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23At&amp;Mode=like">#At</a> Night and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23While&amp;Mode=like">#While</a> Their Past Selves are Asleep. The GM might have a resource pool to make it challenging, like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23But&amp;Mode=like">#But</a> This Was the All Nighter for Exams, etc.  Failure could lead to Paradox (maybe even a Mage way where the traveller is hurt by the universe and preventing a contradiction) or simply who's right. If the player fails, then that only determines that, yes, that was indeed the night of the all nighter, there's no chance to sneak up to the box.<br/><br/>*I don't mean it's forced travel, they might be doing it to improve their own lives or other selfish reasons, or trying to improve the world for reasons of their own altruism instead of trapped in new situations that need solving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117858/#Comment_117858" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T22:04:17+00:00" title="January  3, 2008 10:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, are you asking about rules to ensure games with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_paradox" rel="nofollow">Predestination paradoxes</a>?

It's called Timestream, and I dunno if things work in it the way you're talking about (in terms if I have a set of "Time Travel Laws" that I personally like, but they're pretty arbitrary in the big picture of things).  But the basics are that the mechanical stuff about paradox and such is a dial set by the group, so you could easily say that the big changes in history stuff gives you, say, twice the normal amount of Strain (my term for accumulating amounts of paradox) than in the base rules, or something along those lines.<br/><br/>Part of the basics are that the first time you try to change something, you're working against what "normally" would happen, and each time you try to change it again after that,  you're working both against the original event, and your first effort to change the event, so it's harder. There's diminishing returns to trying to change an event over and over. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>The key is whatever you do you have to still make sure you go back and still do it.  Basically finding ways to change things that don't change what you have done (which is go back in time to change things).</blockquote>\nSo, in Timestream, stiffining the Strain penalties for doing stuff that changes what you've already done may work out. Anyhow, it's another perspective if you're looking at all the time travel stuff out there.

His theory, and he fully expresses this, collides head on to what you want to do (as is apparent in his review of <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118049/#Comment_118049" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T02:51:38+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  2:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2008 2:52AM by Joe Murphy.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're writing, or have written a timetravel game (and Timestream is excellent), you owe it to yourself to try this 15 minute Flash game:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nekogames.jp/mt/2008/01/cursor10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nekogames.jp/mt/2008/01/cursor10.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118067/#Comment_118067" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T08:10:20+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  8:10AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a fucking cool game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118078/#Comment_118078" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T10:13:01+00:00" title="January  5, 2008 10:13AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brilliant game.<br/><br/>Thanks for the kind word, Joe!

Basically it is 12 monkeys the roleplaying game. The way I approached time travel was that there is one timeline the players manipulate. When they change something everything else forwards of that point rearranges slightly to accomodate. Once they have rearranged it enough the apocalypse never happens.
