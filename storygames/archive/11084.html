The sites look like online directories, but they're obviously just a bunch of search results with a ton of ads wrapped around them. Is anyone else seeing this? What are you opinions?<br/><br/>Also, I'm getting a lot of hits from porn Web cam sites. Is this happeneing to anyone else? Is there some kind of linkage scam here, or are people just talking about my games on their nude Web cams a lot?<br/><br/>I realize that the received wisdom is that any link is a good link, but I'm a little annoyed that they're diluting my Google results. After all, the obvious goal of these sites is to take someone who's looking for my games, and get them to click on an ad instead.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246005/#Comment_246005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T17:43:38+00:00" title="December  9, 2009  5:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm getting similar stuff lately. The ones I get are randomly combined snippets of articles on sites that are superficially dressed up as blogs, with links to my things intermixed. Usually it's 2-3 paragraphs of my writing with a half dozen other sources all jumbled up. Strange, really, and clearly script-generated.<br/><br/>No idea what the purpose is - maybe it's a computer virus that's gained sentience? Or less fantastically, somebody trying to gain Google rank by linking to legitimate endeavours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246015/#Comment_246015" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-09T19:35:49+00:00" title="December  9, 2009  7:35PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>Also, I'm getting a lot of hits from porn Web cam sites.
