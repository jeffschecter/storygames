Warhammer 40,000 Rogue Trader was my entry into wargaming back in 1988. I had collected minis for RPGs before, but Rogue Trader was the first game I bought minis for to move around on a board with measuring tapes and fists full of d6s.<br/><br/>Alas my interest faded even before Warhammer 40K 2nd Edition came out. Rogue Trader had become 2E and was no longer a small skirmish game, but now a battle game. I still bought fluff and new minis although I no longer played. Necromunda came out, but it was gangs set in 40K, not 40K proper. I wanted me some piratical space elves not Shakespearian Italian gangstas.<br/><br/>Then as GW brought out the Lord of the Rings game, they brought out Inquisitor. Ignoring the beautiful, but limited 54mm miniatures range, the game squarely aimed at people like me. But the rules were dodgy, needlessly complex and incomplete. It looked and played like someone had tried to take Rogue Trader and mix it with Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play with the WD Confrontation rules sprinkled on it like like glitter at a princess party.  Nice big minis though...<br/><br/>Then last year GW released Shadow War Armageddon, Necromunda with real 40K armies. It was self-contained and not just an add-on like Kill Team. It was exactly Necromunda and all that entails (swingy mechanics, weird momentum,...). Still it was a squad with XP and skills, but...<br/><br/>Still reading?  Want me to get to the point?<br/><br/>It was time for my yearly flip through Rogue Trader and convincing myself that you couldn't play it today because...reasons. While doing a bit of research I found a bunch of interviews with Rick Priestly (the author and person most responsible for 40K). Seems he always intended Rogue Trader to be run as an RPG--with multiple figures. Your squad was your character or party if you will. It's not a mistake Rogue Trader needs a game master.<br/><br/>Then I looked back at Inquisitor. Also requires a GM, also harkens back to the origins of 40K as an RPG. Forget SWA for now, we'll get back to that.<br/><br/>Seems 40K was always meant to be played with your mates with dice in one hand, brew in the other and tongue firmly in cheek. This was the part that tied everything together. I had fallen in love with a game where each miniature had a name and we cheered or lamented the death of characters rather than models. Each figure had their own history and sense of continuity. Then 40K became a war-game proper and I lost interest in it.<br/><br/>What I yearn for is a game with the ideas of Warhammer 40,000 Rogue Trader, but some how better realized. The closest would be Shadow War Armageddon, but it is still rooted in competitive battle games, the skill list giving away what the focus should be about.<br/><br/>Somewhere between Rogue Trader, Inquisitor and Shadow War Armageddon lies a great way to tell stories in the 41st millennium of mankind with little plastic elf dollies. 30 years after the event , at least I now know what I'm looking for.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471397/#Comment_471397" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-03T23:29:31+00:00" title="April  3, 2018 11:29PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Wish I wasn't about to run to work right now, so I could give a better response, but here I go anyway...)<br/><br/>The closest thing I've seen in that spirit ( not mechanics or genre, though) is <i>To Be Continued ...By GASLIGHT</i>.<br/><br/>It's a supplement to the GASLIGHT ( Victorian SF) miniatures battle game ( which tends towards a beer and pretzels attitude itself).<br/><br/>To Be Continued...by GASLIGHT s the closest I've found to a functional set of rues for semi/demi RPG style play in an action-adventure environment with miniatures and using a GM.<br/><br/>Do a search for it, and I'll try to pop back in and talk more about what makes it cool over the next couple of days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_S" title="Noah_S"><img alt="Noah_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_S">Noah_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471399/#Comment_471399" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-04T02:19:43+00:00" title="April  4, 2018  2:19AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Chairman_Aeon">@Chairman_Aeon</a> YES. 40k: Rogue Trader is my nostalgia-keystone, as the entry point that later led to AD&amp;D 2e, Shadowrun, Call of Cthulhu, and on to the rest of my gaming history. I actually gave a math class presentation in 4th or 5th grade about 40k\u2019s vehicular speeds and turning radii and such... <br/><br/>I think it always felt like an RPG to me also, and that\u2019s certainly the direction it ended up steering me. There are some great games that have at least some degree of 40k influence, ranging from Stars Without Number to 3:16 Carnage Among the Stars, but I can say for sure that I still have an appetite for more.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve been reading Scum and Villainy, and listened to a stream of Band of Blades recently (KelsaDelphi on Twitch) \u2014 both Blades in the Dark hacks, and both seem to have some promise for Rogue Trader adaptation, or maybe even full out debadged Rogue Trader hack glory.<br/><br/>I\u2019d love to see something that incorporates some of the lightweight but meaningful tactical decision making from 3:16 (which very intentionally supports plastic elfs on the range bands) along with more complex long term systems like Blades and fam. I\u2019m particularly interested to see what Band of Blades does with combat, which has been very purposefully de-tactified in Blades in the Dark itself (to great effect for the intended play in my opinion).<br/><br/>Apologies for the text wall, but this really resonated with me! I\u2019m running a Blades in the Dark campaign currently but can\u2019t help daydreaming about modernized 40k adventures from time to time, and may attempt a hack myself if no one else beats me to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471411/#Comment_471411" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-04T14:27:53+00:00" title="April  4, 2018  2:27PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While there are other issues, the real world expense related to the elf dollies is part of the problem in creating minis-using RPGs vs. making viable minis wargames.<br/><br/>( And for a long time, GW minis were at the more expensive end of the spectrum for readily available minis. Now other companies have caught up with them, so they all tend to be rather pricey, with a few notable exceptions)<br/><br/>I've spilled a lot of electrons over this issue, but truthfully have never found even a vaguely satisfactory answer that uses actual miniatures.<br/><br/>The best, closest thing I can find is something like:<br/><br/>Start with a wargame genre/period that people are already interested in, that uses individually based minis at least at 28mm scale ( or larger).<br/><br/>Now use that as the basis of the RPG.<br/><br/>The second best thing I could come up with is: make an RPG that uses cheap Heroclix (and other Clix ) minis as the bulk of the desired minis.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noah_S" title="Noah_S"><img alt="Noah_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noah_S">Noah_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471424/#Comment_471424" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-04T21:45:53+00:00" title="April  4, 2018  9:45PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My DnD group uses minis, but only for vague positioning and thematic inspiration \u2014 and we tend to use a mix of \u201creal\u201d DnD minis alongside clix, hershey kisses, pennies, muscle men, 20-some year old unpainted metal minis, etc.<br/><br/>That\u2019s not far from my sweet spot, though I do like range bands a la 3:16 since they enable a tactical layer to positioning without needing to get too detailed.

The first one you mention is essentially adding roleplaying gaming into a pre -existing wargame environment. If you have 5 pals already p[laying WH40K in some form, each with different factions, convincing them to each start buying some handful of "RPG" character figures should be easier, especially since their wargame army figures can now do double duty and are especially useful as opposition for the GM to use. In a sense, that's what both Shadow War and Inquisitor ( if you used 28mm, rather than 54mm minis) attempted to do, and even Necromunda and Gorkamorka to some extent.<br/><br/>The rotating GM thing can work if everyone has a similar genre and scale in mind and is already a committed Lead-Head ( or Lego Head, possibly) In that case, the GM really does take the bulk of the buying/building work on themselves ( and associated cost and effort), but you get more of that consistent artistic vision people talk about. In return, all the other involved parties ( or at least two others, I suspect) are doing the same thing, so you projects in rotation. This is more like the convention-goer approach, where people cart these magnificent minis collections and associated table set ups/terrain across the country to put their specific scenario on for other folks, then spent the rest of their weekend rotating through other time slots in other participants' scenarios at their tables.<br/><br/>It's way more expensive, but you're involved with like minded hobbyists who are returning the favor on the regular.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chairman_Aeon" title="Chairman_Aeon"><img alt="Chairman_Aeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chairman_Aeon">Chairman_Aeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471507/#Comment_471507" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-07T21:03:04+00:00" title="April  7, 2018  9:03PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Minis and costs aren't as big a problem for me.

But you could also assemble a couple of "factions" of miniatures (16 miniatures each) and I think you'd have enough for several games. <br/><br/>Keep a chess set on hand as well for odds and ends. <br/><br/>Players would be responsible for providing their own character's miniature.<br/><br/>For example, I don't know much about Rogue Trader or the like, but from the bits I've picked up about Warhammer 40K, you could have:<br/><br/>Black: The Planet's Authorities<br/>King: Archivist<br/>Queen: Inquisitor<br/>Rooks: Space Marines<br/>Bishops: Commissars<br/>Knights: Alien Ambassadors<br/>Pawns: Imperial Guard<br/><br/>White: The Underbelly<br/>King: Crime Boss<br/>Queen: Sewer Monster<br/>Rooks: Smugglers<br/>Bishops: Psykers<br/>Knights: Genestealer Cultists<br/>Pawns: Ruffians<br/><br/>I feel like that set of 32 miniatures would be able to cover all kinds of shenanigans and battles, and also situations where the PCs might hire some Ruffians or befriend a Psyker or have to escort an Archivist, etc. <br/><br/>Then if you wanted to introduce a third faction, you could start using the chess pieces, and then as you build up the miniatures you could sub them in.<br/><br/>This model would also work well if each player has a miniatures-collecting responsibility: you could say each player is responsible for one of the factions, and they would know that their contribution is capped at 16 miniatures - they can plan ahead and not feel ambushed if a subsequent adventure suddenly involves 30 kobolds.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471545/#Comment_471545" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T12:34:16+00:00" title="April  9, 2018 12:34PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2018 12:40PM by komradebob.">edited April 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I would disagree with using chess pieces for the reason you already mentioned, the overall concepts of<br/><br/>1) Building around a smallish, flexible collection that can be used for lots of related things, repeatedly, and as-needed, and<br/><br/>2) Dividing up the collecting duties in some reasonable, organized fashion are both very solid concepts.<br/><br/>From looking at these kinds of questions a bit, the types of games that are problem children for using minis are<br/><br/>A) Settings with a very broad universe of critters and/or significantly rising power levels ( D&amp;D is the obvious poster child for this problem).<br/><br/>[If you truncate the critter list and have minis that can be re-used, this is less of a problem.  3rd/4th Age Middle Earth or  the Game of Thrones universe would both be vastly simpler to do than generic D&amp;D for a variety of reasons. From a slightly different angle, Lankhmar or Sanctuary would also be easier]<br/><br/>B  ) Settings with a very specific visual style ( To an extent, the 40K universe has this problem, as does something like Star Trek)<br/><br/>[This can be mitigated simply by being a bit flexible on look and going for the more small scale and behind the frontlines stuff, more Inquisitor than Death Watch, for example]<br/><br/><br/>Things that keep a budget down:<br/><br/>1) Games that have a lot of civilian interaction and where minis are produced for those civilians at a reasonable cost ( hopefully by a few different companies)<br/><br/>So, some historical or semi-historical genres ( historical + weird elements would be a common example). Stuff like superheroes ( especially street level supers), or semi-horror monster hunting, Victorian SF/Mystery, some kinds of espionage, that sort of thing.<br/><br/>For almost anything modern/near future, plundering cheapo-Heroclix/ Other 'Clix and repurposing them ( through repainting and kitbashing as needed) is a good starting place for everything that isn't a PC ( and some things that are).<br/><br/>2) Settings where we can easily mash different eras and aesthetics<br/><br/>The Firefly/Serenity universe with it's frontier/Old West look combined with a lesser amount of near future look, and very little obvious SF elements save for the ships themselves would be really easy to put together. A big smashed, kitchen sink universe, like a Gamma World-ish setting would also be very easy to do on a budget, since you really can use almost anything at all, and that opens up all sorts of bargain hunting possibilities.<br/><br/><br/>3) Settings where the universe is relatively "small"<br/><br/>If you were to constantly emphasize the villager NPCs from something like <i>Beyond the Wall and Other Tales</i> and have limited "monster" based adventures, you could do that fairly easily on a budget. If the monsters make repeat appearances, even easier.<br/><br/>Really anything that mainly focusses on a relatively small population of characters ( PCs/NPCs/Monsters) in a relatively smallish geographic area ( a single town/city/spaceship) is going to be easier to get going and to expand on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471548/#Comment_471548" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T13:13:29+00:00" title="April  9, 2018  1:13PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every genre has tropes, stock characters and archetypal character.

It's nice enough, fairly light weight and meant for 2 player up to maybe six players, with forces about the size you'd be used to from the later Rogue Trader minis game rules era. Basically 2-3 squads and maybe a vehicle per player. Like RT, GASLIGHT does have some recognition of miniatures as individual characters, especially leader/officer/hero types ( who sometimes have some distinct special abilities as well).<br/><br/>Those are the core rules.  Like RT, it drops them in your lap and tells you to figure out how you want to use them.<br/><br/>To Be Continued By Gaslight takes those core rules, modifies them a bit, drops the action back to something similar to Necromunda/GorkaMorka/Inquisitor/Legends of Blank scale of action. Players are generally using a main character or two and some lesser, good guy mooks. There are some rules for going with fewer but more competent characters, or more lesser characters ( Sgt So-and so and his squad, for example). Again, the core rules are solid, bland-ish skirmish rules. Functional, but not really anything to write home about.<br/><br/><b>Where it sings is in its conceit that the campaign being played is an old serial movie, to be played across 12 chapters.</b><br/><br/>It is those rules that I think you should check out. They suddenly make everything else viable.<br/><br/>Within a chapter of the overall story/adventure/movie/campaign/serial, you pretty much just plain play it like a one-off skirmish battle. You have a GM who is coming up with the overall, broad strokes of the adventure, but really only has broad ideas ( and a related set of toys for terrain and maybe some baddies).<br/><br/>It's up to the players and GM collectively to make the main characters, certainly the Good Guys, but maybe also some player played baddies or rivals as well. Or separate teams of Good Guys. Whatever.<br/><br/>The Gm is really supposed to come up with the road outline of the serial and an opening chapter or two, then pretty much just use random charts, events in the previous chapter, some random tables, and the constraints of their toy collection to build the rest of it largely ad hoc, from session to session. And, possibly with help from the players, to string the developing narrative together, at least enough to make one skirmish/chapter tie in to the next one.<br/><br/>Also, as the campaign/serial starts to near the final chapters, to start pulling the various strings of previous chapters together towards a satisfying and climactic final pair of chapters.<br/><br/>Main characters can "die", but mostly in the old serial, cliffhanger sense, as paired with basic minis skirmish rules. In other words, if the mechanics of the game say that Indiana Jones takes a bullet and dies, he's dead. For that chapter/skirmish. He isn't dead-dead though unless it's the final chapter. And maybe not then, Mostly it's up to the players. If they want to stop playing that character that "dies" they're dead until the player decides otherwise. Because, hey... Source Material Emulation!<br/><br/>Beyond that, there are some other great ( or at least neat) things going on. <b>Players<br/></b> can compete on the campaign level for Victory Points. Yes, they get them through their miniatures/characters, but they belong to the player.<br/><br/>This means that if one player is always playing the heroes, but other players are bouncing from various NPCs and/or villains over the course of the game's chapters, they still personally get victory points.<br/><br/>No surprise, Victory Points can be traded in prior to the end of the game for character upgrades and rerolls and such, so there's a balancing element ( some may find it frustrating. I think it's neat).<br/><br/>What I'm pretty sure this means is that you could have Indiana Jones win in-fiction, but have their player use up VPs to do it. The in-fiction result is that IJ and pals have once again beaten various villains and ultimately recovered the magical artifact ( satisfying for the emulationist urge) but Bob whop played IJ and pals has 20 VPs while Fred who played various premade/NPCs villains and rivals has 21. Fred has gained the real-world player victory. Weirdly, that should work to influence spending almost exactly in a way that mimics the inspirational materials. Towards the end  of the story, the heroes start pulling out all kinds of unlikely successes.<br/><br/>Anyway, there's a bit more than that to it, but certainly could be great inspiration for an RT inspired minis using RPG.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chairman_Aeon" title="Chairman_Aeon"><img alt="Chairman_Aeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chairman_Aeon">Chairman_Aeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471564/#Comment_471564" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-09T17:26:41+00:00" title="April  9, 2018  5:26PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hopeless_Wanderer, as the OP what I'm getting at is an emergent narrative using skirmish battles.

It can be tracked down via the Wayback Machine if people are interested. <br/><br/>The procedure in In a Grail Epoch is:<br/><br/>1. Whittle your miniatures collection down to 12<br/>2. Each player gets one miniature for their character (it's a three-player game), and names them. <br/>3. The remaining miniatures are the NPCs. They get names and factions (there are three factions, but not necessarily with an equal number of NPCs)<br/><br/>There's also a map with nine locations, and nine connections between locations. As characters are eliminated from the game, new locations are created until the fourth character is eliminated, at which point new connections between locations are created. <br/><br/>Chairman_Aeon, I wonder if that gives some ideas for the map you could use. You might have a network of locations and the connections between them, with members of factions deployed in different locations. Then maybe for a particular battle you can use any troops you control in that location and the ones adjacent. <br/><br/>Or maybe PCs are placed on the map, and when they get into scrapes they battle alongside a generic kill team of their faction. Each player could control a faction with a stable of PCs, then, and run missions against - or with - other players' PCs, without ever needing more than one kill team's worth of miniatures (plus however many PCs). <br/><br/>EDIT: Also of interest might be the original thread for A Grail Epoch <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16957/a-grail-epoch" rel="nofollow">on here</a> and an FU-A Touch of Evil RPG-boardgame mash up <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?629445-FU-A-Homebrew-RPG-of-the-quot-A-Touch-of-Evil-quot-boardgame-using-FU" rel="nofollow">on RPGnet</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471591/#Comment_471591" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-10T08:06:29+00:00" title="April 10, 2018  8:06AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought about a similar system to create "fishtank stories" with abstract, social and spatial locations as well.

Gave me a bit of time to reflect on this rambley idea.<br/><br/>Inquisitor is a game that tries to mash Laserburn (via Confrontation) and WFRP. It was overly fiddly and very lightweight at the same time. Necromunda took the basic ideas of Rogue Trader and expanded upon them--with a totally different setting. Shadow War Armageddon tried to bring the 40K armies into Necromunda, but at the expense of a detailed campaign system.<br/><br/>My ideal system would be a game with the ideas of Inquisitor (individual and possibly disjointed characters with a universal RPG-lite talent/skill system), but with a simpler system more akin to the old or just released Necromunda. Or maybe more sunsinctly (if not more tongue in cheek), WFRP-lite for miniatures where parties battle parties rather than NPCs.<br/><br/>Sanglorian, I'll check that out. The core battle rules are probably the easiest thing to do, see SWA. The real problem is how do you set up a campaign system that is just as fun as the miniature pushing and die rolling. A map with multiple locations also mean that while any battle is still a small skirmish, the player has a excuse to have many more models than any one battle would need.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474015/#Comment_474015" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T13:59:11+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  1:59PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2018 2:22PM by komradebob.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how is the thought process coming along?<br/><br/>A couple of days ago, I was poking around over on theminiaturespage.com, and someone was talking about a new toy collection/game they were putting together with a buddy and they used a term like "narrative gamin", which probably means something slightly different there than around here.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was a kind of Colonial ( actually, post American War of Independence) Gothic/Horror type game setting, and they were collecting and building all of the relevant toys for it. The guys talking about it seemed, if in a different genre, on the same basic concept trajectory.<br/><br/>Every now and then I catch sight of something like that. As it turns out, there are actually lots of little niche, experimental minis-using games being created and refined regularly. Most of them seem to continue to exist as local club rules or even just individual, small group projects, and never end up in commercially available form.<br/><br/>I suspect, IOW, that types of gaming with minis that eventually sparked RPGs in the '70s have continued to exist the whole time, just never achieving orbit. And, of course, get re-invented repeatedly by unconnected groups, separated, but sharing similar interests ( in the present day, almost all certainly having some RPG background, in addition to minis gaming background).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So, the thread I found was lined to a guy's blog. He uses the term "narrative miniatures adventures" to describe his gaming, and he uses that term to differentiate it from "Wargaming".<br/><br/>I will have to do some more digging to see if he goes into more detail about what that means in practice, and if any other minis gamers are using that term.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's his blog:<br/><a href="https://carrioncrowsbuffet.wordpress.com/2018/05/14/in-a-dark-dark-wood/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://carrioncrowsbuffet.wordpress.com/2018/05/14/in-a-dark-dark-wood/</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
