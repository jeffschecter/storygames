Don't stretch for it, it doesn't have to be startling or the coolest thing ever said, it just has to be some clear detail such as an observer might notice.</i><br/><br/>And then they throw out a piece of writer advice for us to map a technique to.<br/><br/>Totally fine for multiple people to map different mechanics/techniques to the same snippet.<br/><br/>So, I'll start, with (no idea who coined this):<br/><br/><br/>"Story <i>is</i> character."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_319897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/319897/#Comment_319897" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-10T10:33:36+00:00" title="April 10, 2011 10:33AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't let this post go gentle into that good night - come on all, it'll be fun *and* educational - so much of the latest crop of RPG's owe a debt to Ron Edwards for looking at Egri and saying, "Hey, there's no game that does this, I'll make one" - I'm wondering if we can systematize the application of that process ... and have fun doing it.<br/><br/>Maybe "Story is character" is too vague. I'll throw out some more. Can anybody think of game mechanics that go with these nuggets:<br/><br/>* Write what you know.<br/><br/>* Writing depends heavily on precision of detail. (There's more games than IaWA that hit this note.)<br/><br/>* Write the kind of story that you like to read. (This one's also from Gardner)<br/><br/>* When describing, use all five senses.<br/><br/>* A story begins with someone wanting something ... even if it's just a warm bed to sleep in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320005/#Comment_320005" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-11T08:38:06+00:00" title="April 11, 2011  8:38AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2011 8:41AM by Deliverator.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><br/>* Write what you know.</blockquote>\nMakes me think of Jeepform, where players are actually encouraged to bring their real-life issues to the table.\n<blockquote>* When describing, use all five senses.</blockquote>\n1,001 Nights, duh.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
