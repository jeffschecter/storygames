I originally did this really fast as a tail to a friend on MSN, and while I have edited it, I might have missed some things)<br/>\n<br/>\nSession 1: The Escape from Sorrow<br/>\n<br/>\nThis first session was a while ago, so I'm a tad hazy on some things. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe start, as per usual, in the Brig of the Hand of Sorrow. The Brig is, in the case of our game, a large room with cages suspended from the ceiling and a single bored guard doing sudoku in the corner. Whispered plans are thrown back and forth until Captain Vance finally gets sick of it all, grabs Naomi's arm, and teleports the both of them behind the guard. Vance motions to knock him out. Naomi snaps his neck, and gets herself the first XP of the game (we used red poker chips to track XP, by the way, and white ones for pool dice). Vance starts ordering Kale to do things. Kale does them. This nets them both XP. Everybody finds this highly amusing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe party decide that the only way they can escape is to shut down the auxiliary power couplings in the engine room, and thus prevent the ship from steering, deploying fighters, or tracking its guns. Vance don's the deceased guard's uniform, and pretends to be assorting the prisoners to the aft brig. The few troopers they bump into on the way fall for it completely. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the group reaches the engineering section, they split up. Vance now pretends to be showing Captain Hollas' sister (as played by Lady Blackbird) around the engine room, and Snargle and Kale sneak off to to engineer's locker room to get some disguises. This is temporarily hampered by a huge Samoan-looking engineer who just got out of the showers, and greets them asking why he hasn't seen them before. Kale thinks quickly, and shacking the engineer's hand, explains that he's been in the infirmary since the last port. <br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh, you know how it is. Port town girls. Contagious diseases. That sort of thing"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the Samoan engineer quickly goes off to wash his hands, Snargle and Kale help themselves to some engineers' uniforms and go mingle in the engine room. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing them signal to her, Lady Blackbird creates a diversion. Putting on her hautiest noble voice, she loudly berates the goblin chief  engineer for the "Deplorably filthy" state of the engines, the engineers, and his own outlandishly huge mustache. As the chief engineer and his mustache wither under her scorn, Kale sets about magically shattering a few essential parts for the auxiliary power couplings. Alarms sound, and as the engineers stop watching Lady Blackbird with a mixture of terror and amused fascination, our heroes make this exit. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey make it most of the way to the forward docking bays when them bump into trouble... specifically, Captain Hollas and his two robot bodyguards. They give chase until Lady Blackbird unleashes a mailstorme of magical power, frying the robots and blowing Hollas down the corridor and out of sight. As the alarms pick up a notch, the group hurry into the docking bay.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the bay is like a big hanger. Most of the ship's fighter compliment is stowed here, as is the Owl. All of them are stowed by being attached by chains and pulleys to the roof, and are accessed by a series of suspended walkways. The actual entrance to the bay is in the form of large, round hatches under each docking clamp. When a fighter (or other ship) deploys, it literally drops straight down. Or it would... if the doors were open. They're closed. And the auxiliary power, which is neede to open them, has just been shut off. There is a backup local generator, but it's on the bay floor, a dozen meters below. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the fighter pilots who were having a tea break here just noticed Our Heroes. They draw their electrical swords and advance. <br/>\n<br/>\nNaomi gets stuck in, Vance grabs a lightning sword and faces off against the wing leader, Commander Crane... who, we learn in a flashback scene, was a constant pain in the butt for both Vance and Kale when they were in the imperial navy, years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nSnargle hooks up a fuel line to the Owl, and starts doing pre-flight checks, whileKale starts clambering down the stairs towards the backup generator... Lady Blackbird decides to take a faster route and user her new Fly spell. She fails miserably and crashes to the deck below, badly hurting her leg. Snargle and Kale catch up with her, and together the three of them start the generator, and jam it in the on position, just as a group of imperial marines burst in at the other end of the bay, and start firing. The two retreat back up the stairs, as the marines advance and try to stop the generator.<br/>\n<br/>\nVance and Crane has fought each other to standstill. At which point Naomi, having finishes with Crane's buddies, walks up behind him and snaps his neck. Vance is a bit peeved about this, but has other things to worry about... the marines are charging up the stairs towards lady blackbird! He slices througha  hydraulic cable and swings onto the stairway, placing himself in the path of the marines and two experience points.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerforming a gallant fighting retreat, the group reach the top of the stairwell, and Naomi breaks the supports, sending the marines falling... through the now mostly-open docking bay doors, below. Everybody piles into the ship, and Snargle releases the clamps as the other marines stop the generator. The Owl plummets out of the Hand of Sorrow, only marginally damaging the port side engine, and leaving Captain Hollas furiously waving his fist out a veiwport as they fly off into the Blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSession 2 write-up coming soon...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230433/#Comment_230433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T14:16:38+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  2:16PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the AP!

And no, they hadn't played TSOY before. They really loved being able to give themselves XP through their actions, though, and I'm thinking of implementing a similar system of keys in some of the other games we play.<br/>\n<br/>\nLady Blackbird's character did start to get a little peeved with everybody protecting her to hit their keys by the end of the first session, so I suggested maybe she should gt the Key of Independence (hit it each time you ignore somebody trying to help you). She doesn't done that yet, but only because she was AWOL for most of the second session.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, during the whole of the first session, he had the wonderful Elecrtic Violin music of Vanessa Mae (specifically her Storm album) playing in the background. It was wonderfully atmospheric. Here is an awesome example: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpd3OE_1G4M" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpd3OE_1G4M</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, part-way through this session, one of the player unilaterally declared that goblins look like this guy: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.spookhouse.net/angelynx/otheranime/Storm-Hawks/Stork-alas.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.spookhouse.net/angelynx/otheranime/Storm-Hawks/Stork-alas.jpg</a> Nobody had a problem with it, so that's what goblins look like in our Big Blue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway....<br/>\n<br/>\nSession 2: A Haven for Old Troubles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Owl limped into Haven, a world of swamps and bayous (inspired by the Credence Clearwater CD that was on at the time). I haven't a clue what will happen this session, having done no prep whatsoever. As a result, the players do the default thing when they hit a new town. They go to the nearest bar, and seek out whoever is sitting in the shadiest corner. Snargle and Lady Blackbird stay back at the ship.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out this is Davis Marks, a long-lost comrade of Kale and Vance's that they haven't seen in years. A huge man with a bionic leg and a scruffy beard. They sit down and share a few drinks. it turns out that Davis runs a shop that sells second-hand ship parts, which is fortuitous, as the Owl needs a new port side engine after the narrow escape from the Hand of Sorrow. They start haggling over the price when Naomi notices a shifty-looking goblin using the bar's wireless to make a call, and looking right at them. Everybody gets up to leave, but too late...<br/>\n<br/>\nJakka "the Hat", the local goblin crime boss and owner of a steam-powered top hat (don't ask me what it needs the power for...) bursts in, along with about a dozen goons. The moment is tense, as I literally have no idea what I'm doing. Until Vance chimes in<br/>\n<br/>\n"Jakka! Buddy! Long time no see. Errr... we'll get you that money back real soon"<br/>\n<br/>\nRoll opening credits.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe come back to Jakka puffing on his noxious cigar and explaining that he ate the last man who defaulted on a a loan. He had him sliced thinly and served on crackers.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Look, Vance, it's very simple. I'm gonna get my money's worth. The question is whether it's gonna be in Gold or in Gristle. Your choice"<br/>\n<br/>\nVance does some panicked fast talking, and manages to get Jakka to agree to give them a week to repay the dept. Jakka, however, wants collateral, and orders that his men (or goblins, rather) to impound the Owl. As Jakka leaves, Vance borrows Davis' portable wireless (built into his removable bionic foot) and calls the Owl, telling Lady Blackbird and Snargle to clear out before the goblins show up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEverybody meets up at Davis' place, a warehouse hovering over the omnipresent swamps of Haven (much like every other building around here), chock-full of ship parts, including half an imperial fighter hanging from the ceiling. The group have no access to the ship, so how are they going to make the money to pay off Jakka?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, turns out Davis has a plan. Or, at least the beginnings of one. Tomorrow is the Haven 25th Annual Sabak* Open Tournament. Gamblers are coming from all over the Blue to compete for the grand prize... which happens to be about double the amount that Jakka wants. Davis has been trying to think up a way to rig the event for years, but lack the man power to pull it off...<br/>\n<br/>\nCue one of the longest, most convoluted planning sessions I've ever encountered in all my years of GMing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Tournament is held every year in the Haven City Hall, a huge old building floating over the swamp. It's organized by the Trade Union, who do their utmost to ensure that the myriad Clans of haven have no excuse to start a war over some perceived unfairness. As a result, all dealing is done by spherical 4-armed clockwork dealer droids, each of which is made up of 4 quarters built (and decorated) by different clans. Order is enforced by a large team of Marshals, toughs imported from off-world, who wear metal masks, voice distorters, and robes to hide their identity, and prevent any of the Clans leaning on them. They arrive tomorrow, dropped off by passenger transport pods directly to the City Hall.<br/>\n<br/>\nVance hatches a plan...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you're going to have to tune in after this ad break to find out exactly what it is...<br/>\n<br/>\n*blame the players, not me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230455/#Comment_230455" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T18:22:53+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  6:22PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jakka the Hat!

I played Vance, which was great fun, his accent and persona veering wildly between Mal Reynolds, Han Solo, and (oddly enough) Michael Caine before settling down to a broad Southern drawl.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeys were amazing! I've never played TSOY before, so they were totally new to me. It combined all the traditional leveling-up fun with character-driven roleplaying, and pushed conflicts and events in a way that just made sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that this session really reinforced for me is the value of appropriate music. Vanessa Mae's electric violin really set the stage for some fantastic scenes of spacey swashbuckling and epic adventure, and CCR gave Haven a definite sense of place. The soundtrack was an integral part of the game; it gave a natural rise and fall to scenes and spawned a few ideas along the way. All future soundtracks to our games will be measured against this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zartes" title="Zartes"><img alt="Zartes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zartes">Zartes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230488/#Comment_230488" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T02:21:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  2:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh. Glad to see you're enjoying our antics with your wonderful game, Mr. Harper. Also glad to see the Amigo has spotted this. I told you I'd do it eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\nJakka, for all that he's a pun on a certain crime lord from Star Wars, actually acted like a far more carnivorous version of Badger from Firefly.<br/>\n<br/>\nand now, back to the action... specifically, a flashback/refresh scene, set during the last days of the Haven War.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hand of Terror (precursor to the Hand of Sorrow) flies above Haven City, exchanging fire with Havenite ships and ground emplacements, but slowly losing the fight. Cut to the docking bay, where half a squadron of very battered two-man fighters ascends through the hatchways and lock into place. Commander Cyrus Vance, the squadron leader, and his pilot, airman Davis Marks clamber out of the cockpit. A team of robot engineers swarm over the ships, refueling, rearming, and doing what little repairs they can. The engineers' team supervisor, Kale Arkham, greets the returning airmen, when the internal com rings. The ships commander, Admiral Victhoffen ("Vicky" to the crew) demands to know why the wing isn't still out in the battle. Shocked, Vance explains that they were being cut to pieces. As it is, they've taken 50% losses. Victhoffen declares (in a thick German accent) that this is unacceptable, and they have 1 minute to get back in their ships and continue the fight for the Imperial Cause. Victory or Death!<br/>\n<br/>\nVance swears, vehemently and at great length, but he and Davis climb back into their fighter, and the wing (or what remains of it) drops back out of the dock.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe battle is going from bad to worse, as the haven forces begin to deploy hidden weapon emplacements. As the battered fighter wing reenters the battle, a thaumaturge cannon (a large device used to focus and enhance the destructive powers of a sorcerer. Stolen wholesale from Red Star) charges up, and scythes through the fighters. The blast cuts through Vance's ship, taking off Davis' leg and cutting the vessel in half. The pieces tumble towards the swamp below, trailing fire and smoke. Just as they're about to hit, Vance screams, covers his face...<br/>\n<br/>\nand hits the docking bay deck of the Hand of Terror. And so we learn how Vance discovered his teleportation power.<br/>\n<br/>\nKale is shocked to see his buddy appear before him, and rushes over. Vance is shaken, but also furious. He grabs a lightning sword from the nearby rack, and with a determined gleam in his eye, says<br/>\n"Enough good men have died today. It's time we discussed it with "Vicky""<br/>\n<br/>\ncut back to the present<br/>\n<br/>\n"So, yeah, that's how we started the mutiny and ended up as outlaws. How about you, Davis?"<br/>\n<br/>\nDavis explains how he was taken prisoner, and ended up buying the parts shop after the war. Both he and Vance had thought they were the only survivor of the crash. He later salvaged the un-exploded front half of the fighter, but had never had any use for it until now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe use now being the basis for a reproduction of an imperial-made transport Pod. Davis, Kale and Snargle have been madly working on it all night, along with a set of parts for a dealer droid programmed to deal a specific series of cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day, at the town hall landing pad, two officials from the Haven Trade Union wait for the Tournament Marshals to arrive in their pods. High up in Haven's atmosphere (well, it would be, if there wasn't air everywhere), the 16 transport pods are released from the transport vessel that's carried them here. The pods streak downwards... and are met by another, matching pod. It slams, hard, into one of the descending pods, which veers wildly off course, and crashes into the swamps far away from the city.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two Union officials are none the wiser when 16 pods (one slightly dented), land on the pad, and the 64 marshals, each wearing identical robes and masks, step out. The marshals obviously hail from all over the blue, judging by their massively varied builds. Of particular interest to our viewers are the riders of the dented pod... a goblin and three humans, two of them women...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Marshals are quickly put to work, watching over the opening ceremony of the tournament, as the entrants each pay their entry fees into the counting machines which in turn drop all the coins into a huge bullet-proof jar in the center of the hall. Much hubbub is, well, hubbubing, as two of the top favourites for this year's competition enter the building.<br/>\n<br/>\nCaptain Whitefin, an Ictheoid trader and clan leader. A massive shark-man with a goldfish in a bowl on his shoulder and Nigel "the Lenses", the runty but exceedingly smart nephew of Jakka "the Hat", who is being sponsored by Jakka's clan contacts.<br/>\n<br/>\nas Kale puts in his entry (thanks to Davis doing some wrangling), Jakka spots him, and inquires (in a smokey and slightly threatening manner) if Kale is hoping to win enough money to get back the Owl and avoid being used as an afternoon snack. Kale says he's quietly confident. Jakka explains that he might have to settle for getting second place and find the remainder of the funds elsewhere. He'd be very... disappointed if Nigel lost to some newcomer.<br/>\n<br/>\nKale is just digesting this when the defending champion arrives.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnter Count Carlowe<br/>\n<br/>\n(to be continued)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230574/#Comment_230574" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T09:58:18+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  9:58AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zartes</cite>Enter Count Carlowe</blockquote>\nMy cap is doff'd, sir.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230608/#Comment_230608" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T12:09:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 12:09PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After GMing several escapes from the Sorrow, I love the idea of starting out the game with the Owl impounded for debt.<br><br>Jakka for the win!
