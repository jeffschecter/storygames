Not counting the FLGS and conventions, I've played in bars, coffee shops, at a park, at a pool, and in dance clubs. LARPs are pretty damned fun in public, actually, as they often have some secret that must be kept by the players (and thus a mechanical enforcement of "don't freak the mundanes") and you can sometimes recruit the locale's staff to provide plot points or clues (I had a bartender I'd use for a rumor mill). And, obviously, board games, CCGs, and the like port to public just fine. RPGs can be a bit of a balancing act--need to be careful about over-exuberance and disturbing declarations that might be overheard. But then again, fuck 'em if they can't take a joke, I say.<br/><br/>The over-riding benefit is that you really can find new players, for your group if not new to gaming itself. The only thing I'd find tricky to pull off comfortably is any kind of minis play--few adults appreciate the tactics of such play, seeing only "toys." But, again, fuck 'em--I don't point and laugh at their beer pong game (well, yeah, I do sometimes, but only when one team utterly sucks and is in a death spiral).<br/><br/>Best benefit for me: wait staff, beers, and ready-to-eat food, all of which minimize interrupting play. Meeting folks is a close second: you'd be surprised at how often folks will ask "Whatcha doing?"--an icebreaker that also vets folks for open-mindedness. Just don't spill your pint, for God's sake (it's no coincidence that I typically play with my character sheet in a sheet protector, using wet-erase markers for tracking highly variable resource quantities).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211111/#Comment_211111" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T12:36:14+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 12:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2009 12:37PM by C_Edwards.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've done it a few times, at a Barnes &amp; Noble and in high school outside during lunch, at cons of course, and I'm sure a couple other places I'm not remembering.

We still haven't had our gaming/camping trip, though I think we will soon; instead, we wound up playing our first game of Mouse Guard in a nearby park.

It's part of coffee shop culture (at least in Seattle), so doing the same thing but gaming instead isn't a problem for me. We have a regular coffee shop, so we're bringing in business that otherwise wouldn't be there (I'd never been until I gamed there; now I love the place and go there even when I don't game). Posting a game online and bringing new people in exposes new people to the shop, and that's good for business. They're great to us. I believe there's another game group that meets there once a week, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211239/#Comment_211239" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T00:24:33+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 12:24AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I, sort of, game in public now.</p>\n<p>A brief summary of my situation, for those who haven't been following the Life and Times of Lance D. Allen on HBO.</p>\n<p>I am a deployed Soldier, working in a Battalion Ops Center. I work a 12-hour shift, and it's typically pretty quiet. So long as I make sure things continue to run smoothly in the TOC and everything that needs to get done gets done, they're pretty flexible about us doing personal things on work time, from watching movies to surfing the net. At current, I work until 9pm, and twice a week, I get together with some co-workers/friends and we play games. Wednesday nights is card games mostly, but Saturday is RPGs. One of our players is technically at work until midnight, so we can't play anywhere outside of the building where we work. She has to be available for work if it comes up (She's the communications help-desk, essentially) So we play in the Battalion conference room.</p>\n<p>Despite that we play after the normal busy hours of the day, we've never had a play session that didn't have someone cutting through the room, or coming in to see what we are doing. The night guys in the Ops Center are tolerant/condescending about our hobby, so we get a little teasing from that front. The BN Sergeant-Major likes to snag some of our snacks when she comes through. The BN Commander has done a little gaming in his youth, so he likes to come in, wave around a sledgehammer, and tell me I should dock them XP for not showing up on time.</p>\n<p>Frankly, it's annoying as fuck. We've been here for over half a year, and yet the novelty of cruising through and messing with the geeks hasn't worn off much. I, the main social organizer, am not at the bottom of the foodchain when it comes to rank. I can tell a bunch of people to move on if I need to. But most of the people who like to come in are higher up, so I've got to smile, pretend it doesn't irritate the hell out of me, and hope they go away soon.</p>\n<p>This is the sort of thing I imagine happening in public gaming in other venues. Hence, my hesitance to try it out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211263/#Comment_211263" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T06:33:51+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  6:33AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>The over-riding benefit is that you really can find new players, for your group if not new to gaming itself.

The fact that you can play games with them is a side benefit.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd be more concerned about the urge folks have to pick up and handle something that came in 6 parts and took me eight hours to paint. It's like trying to explain to a two year old that a young kitten isn't a stuffed toy and needs to be handled differently.<br/><br/>Personally, my experience has been that TT RPGs and similar are the hardest things to play in a public space, simply due to me not being able to concentrate properly.

Maybe it's playing in club LARPs that did it: suddenly, this was a way to get action from hot chicks in leather and lace! And becoming more confident as both an actor and fiction author meant that, for me, LARP or TT RP became a craft, one which few are good at and which most folks (with whom I'd care to associate) are impressed by, when done well.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's choice of subject matter?

I also play RPGs in public, as well as traditional card games, board games, and so on. <br/><br/>I can tell you from personal experience that, statistically speaking, nobody gives a damn what sort of game you're playing. It's not that people can't tell the difference between Settlers of Catan and Agon, it's that they don't care enough about what you're doing beyond playing a game of some kind. My hair attracts significantly more attention than any public activity I have ever engaged in, and that includes building a catapult on the quad while I was an undergraduate.<br/><br/>Occasionally, someone does decide to be a statistical outlier and ask about what we're up to. This happens substantially more often with the two-player version of Carcassonne than with any RPG ever, and I'm guessing that's because it's a two-player game (so you can play it with your significant other), and it looks like a puzzle of some kind.<br/><br/>So, if you're nervous and don't want to attract attention, play an RPG with 4 players with normal hair rather than a board game with 2 players with unusual hair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211370/#Comment_211370" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T11:16:36+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 11:16AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>"The Durham Three:  Ruinous Bastards."<br/><br/>People don't care as much as you think they do.

But there is definitely an element of familiarity ("puzzle" above): we've been approached more playing CCGs than Icehouse pyramid games, because folks think it's just another card game (or want to talk about bridge, spades, tonk, or poker), while Icehouse mids and six-sided chessboards, Tarot cards, (Gnostica), or glass beads look like something you'd seen in Ten Forward on the Enterprise (heh--or in a Sleestak cave!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211378/#Comment_211378" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T11:27:51+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 11:27AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I think about it, the more I think that it's not so much the activity itself I'd be self-conscious about (ie - role-playing games), but the social weirdness of being part of a large group of people waving and laughing and talking.

In every game in which I've played (one Vamp game was run by Sean Fannon for a spell, to drop a name), the organizers have been very good about approaching non-participants who are curious, about instructing players not to freak the mundanes (*ahem* that's the reason The First Tradition is an actual mechanical rule in Vamp LARPs!), and as representative of the hobby/art to venue owners and/or associated clubs.<br/><br/>Sounds to me like you have only seen either (a) immature players who don't care how their hobby is perceived or (b) folks who ignore The Masquerade, instead playing "Super Vampires." The only time I've seen anything blatant vis a vis observers is at a con, where no one is really "mundane," so folks cut loose (or cut up) a bit more.<br/><br/>Anyway... that's an aside, but I have this knee-jerk reaction to folks who stereotype LARP (a) with reference to some high school/college Vamp game they saw one time on campus or (b) as tantamount to furries, on the Freak Scale.

Your post sounded ignorant, to me, based on my (still considerably greater) experience. It's still relevant to this thread (generally), so may I ask you: as a Head ST for two years, in (again, I'd have to presume because you've seen interaction with non-participants) a relatively public venue, what instruction to or constraint of your player base did you provide or impose, to streamline public relations; and if any, how did it break down so badly that you would, in this day and age, claim that any attempt at audience-participation LARP, micro theater, or public-play LARP is "dangerous ... to unleash on the world?" As a follow-up, do you feel this "danger" is a factor of something other than individual maturity, game subject matter, or general presentation/misunderstanding that might be due to things like costuming or props? I am genuinely curious (more so, now, even) how someone with LARP experience in a game system could make the induction that "this LARP had bad public relation experience(s)" -&gt; "LARPs are dangerous."<br/><br/>Again I reiterate: I have played for years in both club LARPs, coffee shop LARPs, 24-7 public streets and college campus LARPs, and "private" LARPs in parks which are routinely stumbled upon by biker, hikers, and other sightseers. With not one incident of mundane freaking on any notable scale (yeah, nervous laughter is a bit par for the course). Certainly nothing on par with those kids that got shot playing Laser Tag, for instance; or someone calling the cops in a terrorism panic.<br/><br/>Now, all that said, yep, SOME micro theater is... edgy. Risky to the participants (and any audience member with, say, a heart condition). Which is why they tend to gravitate to locations where likely passersby are "hip" or "non-violent types" or generally mellow folks. Or locations where folks sort of expect anything to happen (e.g. cons, faires).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211455/#Comment_211455" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T15:18:40+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  3:18PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, it's been so long since I had to explain to anyone what an RPG is, off the top of my head, that when this Romanian guy at the cooperative walks past us to get to the kitchen, I don't know what to say to him. Naturally, play stops completely while he asks what we're doing. If we weren't usually on a time crunch I would think about it for a minute and try to give him an answer (most people, in my experience, at least have a point of reference for <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, even if they don't actually know what it is).<br/>Most of the time, we act like someone has just come in and asked them what the Hell they think they're doing, even if all they say is "say, you guys playing a game or something?" That, and I hate being interrupted - it takes concentration and a little bit of Zen to stay in character for periods of time, and it's kind of abrupt to get back in Mode after each time someone wanders past. The solution for us, in the short term, is to take up this veteran gamer on his offer to join my playtesting; he has a bigger room than the rest of us, and it'd be better suited, maybe, for a private session than phone-booth style in one of the smaller dorms. <br/>I feel like we need to work on having a space that's more comfortable to play in, and then we can work on changing what <i>kind</i> of space we can be comfortable in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211457/#Comment_211457" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T15:39:00+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  3:39PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Eric, all I will say is that this has not been my experience, and that I have suffered socially in the not very recent past for having been "outed", so to speak.

I don't know why I feel different about them..  <br/><br/>This was a good question made me think about how I approach gaming, not that I am going to suggest to my friends we take our game to Applebee's any time soon..<br/><br/>Now that I think more about it.. One reason I would not go to Applebee or a coffee shop and play RPGs is that I would be using their space.

We will play in public venues, but we try and get some privacy and keep a eye peeled for any Wilsons that might misunderstand.<br/><br/>It can always go wrong, though.  Once, at Dragon*Con, we sta in a McDonald's comparing notes for a LARP we were playing in and were discussing hitmen, bombing a section of the hotel, etc (as Evil Geniuses for a Better Tomorrow, we had work to do!)

I tend to enjoy GMing for my groups alot, even if I'm not GMing I offer the group use of my apartment for play.  Here's why...<br/><br/>-  I'm a bachelor, with enough space for 4-6 gamers plus myself<br/>-  I don't have pets, so no one's bothered or problemed if allergic<br/>-  Comfort:  the group can sit on my couch or various other comfy chairs<br/>-  Kitchen/facilities:  the group is open to use my full kitchen/fridge as they like, and the bathroom's generally clean and nearby<br/>-  All my gamer stuff:  from any book/reference I want, to minis, to things I've collected to make games either more fun or convenient such as hundreds of dice, die tray rollers, tons of office supplies, clipboards,  etc...<br/>-  Tech:  from using my computer/printer to print characters, to googling something,  to using my TV as a screen to show maps and images,  to using custom playlists and/or Pandora stations through my sterio speakers for background mood music,  etc...<br/>-  No one to take us out-of-game by watching or asking questions<br/>-  play as late as we want<br/>-  easy parking or bus routes to my apt<br/>-  nearby fast food or grocery stores<br/><br/>I actually USE alot of the tech and gamer stuff to enhance the games and give better immersion into the story and game.  Playing outside a "controlled" environment makes that just another challenge to deal with.  I'd rather have THAT under control, hence using my apartment...<br/><br/><br/>So much to enjoy......  Why on Earth would I want to go play in a crappy coffee shop.  <br/>I don't game to be social with non-gamers.  I game to enjoy the company of my gamer friends and engross ourselves in our hobby.  I can be in public any other time I want to do non-RPG stuff. <br/><br/>Then again - I also really dislike regular one-shot or convention style games.  I also dislike low-immersion or casual gaming.  If I'm playing an RPG, I'm freakin IN... Otherwise I'd love to play board games, Magic, or something else geeky...  but if I'm gaming - I'd rather have the comforts and all the things that HELP make that immersion work better.<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212263/#Comment_212263" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T18:47:04+00:00" title="June 14, 2009  6:47PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2009 12:13AM by johnzo.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wil and I played several weeks of Beast Hunters -- a very violent and fanciful game -- at a food court duing our lunch hours.  We had a big bowl of colored weird dice on the table so it was clear we weren't just talking intently and scribbling occasional notes.<br/><br/>The public thing didn't hamper the quality of the game at all.  I had a great time.  To get over any lingering self-consciousness, I told myself that people play games in public all the time.  Chess, dominoes, scrabble, cards ... hell, I grew up around old Italians and often had to detour around raucous bocce ball games when I was walking in parks.  <br/><br/>Sometimes people would be curious about what we were doing, and I would think back to when I played at SCA and did some fighting demos.  I found that ordinary folks were always nice to me even if they were puzzled about why I was dressed in boiled leather and armed with a rattan stick.  I'd been coached to plainly and politely explain that I was just playing at a martial art that had an elaborate home crafting component.  More often than not, the curious people would pipe up about craft projects of their own or medieval / fantasy books or movies they'd read, or what martial arts they'd studied or whatever the demo provoked in them.  It was actually kind of fascinating how unguarded people would suddenly get when they were dealing with someone whose dress was so far out-of-bounds.<br/><br/>So whenever anyone asked Wil and I what we were doing, we'd explain it as best we could.  No one got snarky or contemptuous or fearful of us, and I really enjoyed representing the hobby positively.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212279/#Comment_212279" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T22:11:04+00:00" title="June 14, 2009 10:11PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2009 10:13PM by rafial.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Johnzo said!

We'd showed up to play this game, for a set amount of time, so we focused on it.  No TV, computers, or random books to distract.  Also it meant we were in a neutral space, nobody's home turf, which I think also had an interesting effect on the social dynamics of play.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the hot goth girl barrista <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212282/#Comment_212282" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T00:05:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 12:05AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Trollbabe game was wonderful. I think of it often.<br/><br/>There's a very hip, classy bar near my apartment. All dark polished wood and low lighting and a pretty upscale menu. One of the bartenders makes a great Manhattan and another is the second best server in Seattle, so I go there a lot. A while back, our regular gaming location was unavailable, so I suggested we meet at the bar instead. This is how it went down:<br/><br/>Me: Hey, Sarah... is it okay if I push these tables together? I'm meeting some friends here in a bit.<br/>Sarah: Sure. Do you need any extra chairs?<br/>Me: Just one. We're going to play a game... we won't be loud or anything, though.<br/>Sarah: Oh, okay. What game?<br/><br/>So I told her about <i>Contenders</i>. And that was that. Our group played several games there, semi-regularly. For a while, whenever I went to the bar, she would ask if I needed an extra table or anything. "Are you gaming tonight?" -- like it was nothing unusual.<br/><br/>I gotta say, someone bringing me bourbon during a game is a wonderful thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212283/#Comment_212283" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T00:31:57+00:00" title="June 15, 2009 12:31AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the most fun games I've ever played was a live action event in the heart of Sydney within full view of the public.<br/><br/>It was run as a scavenger hunt as a break from a regular ongoing campaign...hundreds of clues scattered across the CBD, dozens of items to collect, half a dozen teams each with a car, and a four hour time frame.<br/><br/>Teams were using mobile phones and video cameras to record their exploits and prove their presence at different locations. If they remained in character (appropriately costumed, or speaking in "in-character" accents) while acquiring the clues or token items, they were rewarded bonus points. The game was a typical modern horror scenario, where the setting reflected the real city of Sydney, costumes went from the sedate to some fairly outlandish monster concepts.<br/><br/>I know there were a few encounters with curious security guards (especially in key locations where clues were found), and at least one dialogue with local law enforcement, but nothing too dramatic. Despite running this in full costume and in full view of the public, I think the local authorities had more important things to deal with on a busy Saturday night.<br/><br/>It was great for a one-off, but the logistics of organising this on a regular basis would be a nightmare.<br/><br/>We ran a similar concept in a theme park as well (due to a number of us working at the theme park at the time and using our connections to score significantly discounted entry for fifty players).<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
