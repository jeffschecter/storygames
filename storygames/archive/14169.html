Skype echo problems aside, it was mostly a lot of fun, but left me rather confused. I ran into several situations that did not feel intuitive at all. <br/><br/>To give you some context, I have run GM-never-rolls games, but never AW, so that may explain my confusion. <br/><br/>1) At one point, an intelligent rat-man was hiding in a dark tunnel, shooting arrows at the players. One player wanted to trick him into coming out, basically ambushing him. It seemed very much like an intelligence roll, but how are you supposed to handle that? Do you make up custom moves for everything?<br/><br/>2) A character was falling into a trap, and another character wanted to pull him to safety. Since the trap was basically a gravity-well, I thought it should be strength based. Same question as above, how do you handle custom situations like this?<br/><br/>3) A similar situation arose when the player did NOT catch said character, and needed to throw his boot at a level which would disable the gravity-well. Volley? What about difficulty? The arc would have been hard because of the extra gravity, and it was a small target. <br/><br/>4) The rules are clear when discussing "starting bonds" and how they affect parley, but I can't find anything explaining the "Bond" box on the front of the character sheet, what it does, or how it ever goes up (which is does say can increase XP). <br/><br/>5) Can you parley any intelligent monster? (Like that rat-sman I talked about earlier. Who cares if he holds a grudge? Makes him easy to trick)<br/><br/>6) What happened to angering the gods when a Paladin heals? There are no negative consequences to the roll with the latest rules. <br/><br/>7) Ok, most important one of the batch: I understand that when a character rolls a 6- you can make a move, like bringing out more bad guys, making something bad happen, whatever --- but it happened WAY too often. I didn't know what to do with them all. This was especially problematic when they entered the dungeon and started getting their butts kicked. I didn't want to make anything else bad happen, because they were dying and trapped. What do I do with those?<br/><br/>So, in short, it was a lot of fun. I LOVE the flavor, the characters, simple combat, the investigative portions, but it got confusing really quick as soon as my players got creative.<br/><br/>Thanks! I'm looking forward to trying it again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321598/#Comment_321598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T16:47:25+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  4:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are just my answers from memory. I'm not sure whether I'm 100% correct or not, but hopefully this will help!<br/><br/>1) Yeah, you pretty much make up a custom move for any situation you can't wrangle the basic moves into. Don't be afraid; it's fun! Also AW/DW players love reading about other people's custom moves.<br/><br/>2) Your call. If a basic move doesn't cover what's going on, you as the MC figure it out. The PCs can and should give input, of course (if they have any to give).<br/><br/>3) Sounds like a custom move to me. Maybe Dex based. Your call though, it might even be a basic move.<br/><br/>4) The bond box is where you keep extra bonds. I think you can add new bonds whenever you want, or at the end of a session? I can't remember.<br/><br/>5) That's the MCs call. You can parley monster if the MC thinks you can get through to it in some way, I would say.<br/><br/>6) It was just removed. If I recall correctly, there were a lot of negative consequences to using a lot of the supernatural powers, which is no longer the case.<br/><br/>7) Remember that you as an MC can only make moves when it's your 'turn' (for lack of a better term). One of the ways to gain access to an MC turn is when a player misses a roll. This is when you get to inflict damage, have your monsters take the advantage, trap them, separate them, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321599/#Comment_321599" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T17:07:21+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  5:07PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something that we're working to make clearer. In fact, I'm writing this as I take a break from writing some stuff related to exactly what you're talking about.<br/><br/>1 is a little hard to call based on what you're talking about here. It sounds like either Parley, if they were trying to talk them out, or just a time for the GM to make a move otherwise. Remember that GM moves happen whenever everyone looks at you to find out what happens, so I'd probably respond with "Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask." Maybe something like "You don't know how many ratmen are down there, are you sure you want to lure them out?"<br/><br/>2 could be handled a couple of ways. If this was something you came up with on the fly, I'd just go with Dodge. I know the name doesn't sound quite right, which is why we're renaming it to Defy Danger (the thing currently called Defy Danger is going to be Saving Throw). That's kind of the catch-all move for doing something despite imminent threat. If this was a trap you'd written up ahead of time, I might have written a custom "When you fight the pull of the gravity well" move.<br/><br/>3 is probably Defy Danger - acting despite the imminent threat of the gravity well.<br/><br/>The idea of the Bonds box is that you can use it to track your actual +Bonds with people. Something like "Arras +1."<br/><br/>You can definitely parley with any intelligent monster! If they hold a grudge, that means they take some action against you as well. Maybe going back to camp and rounding up a gang to drive the PCs out of ratman territory, or setting more traps. Also remember that to Parley, you have to actually take that action ("to do it, do it"). Parleying in the middle of a fight is tough at best. Who's going to listen to you when they're busy fighting for their lives? <br/><br/>You're mostly right about 6, which is why we rewrote them. Angering the gods is fuel for the GM, especially since the gods could do all kinds of things. The bigger problem is, there's no suggestion of what that might typically mean, which means the GM has to really stretch to come up with new divine consequences all the time. Which is why we made a new version. If you're really itching for the new version of Lay on Hands, it's this:<br/><br/>When you touch someone, skin to skin, and pray for your deity to cure them, roll+Cha. On a 10+, you heal them of twice your level damage, or remove one disease up to your level. On a 7-9, they are healed, but the damage or disease is transferred to you.<br/><br/><br/>As to your final question, remember that your moves don't always have to be as hard as they can be. (I'm going to use the DW GM moves for examples here, since I'm not sure if you're using those or the AW MC moves, which are very similar.) "Offer an opportunity, with or without cost" is one of my favorites, since they still get something out of it, but on the GM's terms. And, if you like, those terms can be kind of nice: "The orge swats you away, sending you flying to the other side of the room, then turns on the wizard. Now that you see him from behind, his armor's barely strapped on, you could probably run over and cut it off, but you'd have to run past all the goblins to do it before the wizard gets creamed. Are you risking it?"<br/><br/>"Show signs of doom" can also be kind of easy on them. Announce some doom that's a ways off, or which isn't a direct threat to the players. "The queen seems to be agreeing with you, until her advisor starts whispering in her ear. As he turns to her, you catch a clear glimpse of the Mark of Kathal-thul, the demon cult, on his wrist." I just introduced a new problem on a big scale, the demon cult's infiltrated the royal court, but it doesn't do too much against the players at the moment.<br/><br/>I'm glad you had a good time, and I hope the new version of the rules we're working on will make some of these questions a lot easier to deal with. Thanks for playing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/seanhess" title="seanhess"><img alt="seanhess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/seanhess">seanhess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321600/#Comment_321600" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T17:28:34+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  5:28PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool. Thanks guys. <br/><br/>It sounds like just making up custom moves all the time easily solves 1-3. I'd have to stop and thing about it a bit (and more generic moves like "defy danger" will help to improvise these types of situations), but I can figure it out. Perhaps some guidelines on custom moves would help? (IE: Create 4 options, two negative, on a 7-9 have them pick 1, on a 10+ have them pick 3 -- or something like that.). <br/><br/>One question that remains unanswered is difficulty - you mentioned "Parleying in the middle of the fight is tough", but how do you represent that? Make the consequences more dire if they fail?<br/><br/>The new laying on of hands move is <i>perfect</i>. <br/><br/>Ok, so I think I <i>almost</i> get the too many 6- problem. Do the characters always "fail" on a 6- in addition to making a GM move? I was tempted to allow them to succeed at time in exchange for making a harder move against them. Do you ever do that? <br/><br/>I think with more practice I'll be more skilled and doing subtle moves against players in combat. <br/><br/>Thanks! Great work! I'm looking forward to the next update!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321601/#Comment_321601" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T17:47:12+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  5:47PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bad phrasing on my part - it's only harder because you have to do it. That move only takes place if you can actually talk with someone. That goblin who's fighting for his life probably isn't listening to you much. On the other hand, if you lock swords with the orc shaman and, as you try to break the lock, whisper to him "This could all be over, you know. If you'd just take you tribe back to the mountains, we'd leave you alone." That might be Parley right there, depending on the circumstances.<br/><br/>In the AW book there's a move in the making your own moves chapter for "When things are particularly hard" or "When things are particularly easy" that cover the kind of difficulty you're looking for, the +1 or -1 type. I've never used them, since I don't think they're needed, but that would be the way to make someone especially hard to parley, for example.<br/><br/>The way we handle monsters like that in the brand new monsters chapters (there's a lot of them) is usually to make them, fictionally, harder to get too, or more dangerous. That usually means bigger moves the GM can make on a failure, and sometimes custom moves to really make it hard.<br/><br/>As an example, a giant leech has the move "Attach to someone" so on a failure to, say, sneak by them (Defy Danger/Dodge), a PC could have a leech sucking their blood out - pretty rough. That makes doing things where a leech could attach to you more dangerous in a way, since the consequences are bigger.<br/><br/>The simplest example of a custom move for making things harder would be something like "When you Parley with the Queen, take -1." That's a pretty lame way of doing it, since it doesn't say much about the fiction. "When you Parley with the Queen, present your noble credentials or take -1." is better, both because it has more flavor and because it inspires player action, instead of just giving them a penalty. Even better are custom moves that don't directly interfere, but definitely make their lives tougher, like this one from the satyr: "When a satyr offers you food, drink, or entertainment, accept it and indulge heartily or face the satyr's wrath." It doesn't actually modify any rolls, but if in the process of parleying the satyr offers something, the PC has to either drop the parley and go indulge, or have an angry satyr, who might lash out or storm off, on their hands.<br/><br/>One more note on custom moves: In my experience, many of them turn into Defy Danger/Dodge (AW's Act Under Fire). That's because Defy Danger kind of boils down a move to it's most basic form. If you find yourself making custom moves that look like Defy Danger, better to just drop them. Or, if the move clearly wasn't Dex based, write the very simple custom move "When you Defy Danger against the gravity well, use Str instead of Dex."<br/><br/>Which isn't to say don't make custom moves! Just don't push yourself to make custom moves, when all you're doing is writing a more specific Defy Danger. I've lost many hours this way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321602/#Comment_321602" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T17:52:49+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  5:52PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2011 5:55PM by mease19.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: seanhess</cite>Perhaps some guidelines on custom moves would help?</blockquote>\nCheck out the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13109&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">custom move</a> thread for Apocalypse World to get some general ideas.

What I mean is that in AW, about the time you end up with all your moves being Roll + Cool you're about ready to switch playbooks and broaden your horizons.  In our game, when you're the Fighter, you're the Fighter for life.  I didn't want people to end up stuck with characters who are only ever rolling one stat - it'd lead to XP stagnation if you don't get that stat highlighted and frankly, makes the characters feel one-dimensional and lead play in that direction (what with the "everything looks like a nail" situation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321679/#Comment_321679" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T22:39:58+00:00" title="April 24, 2011 10:39PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense, and is pretty much what I figured.

I *do* think very occasional stat-switching not associated with particular Moves will be a handy tool to have.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
