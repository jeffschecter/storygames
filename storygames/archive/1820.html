                    In another thread, Warren said:
<blockquote>I had a thought when I was explaining Conflict Resolution some time ago. <br/><br/>I'll give a quick recap to explain my thinking.<br/><br/>"Conflict Resolution" = Resolves a conflict of interest between two characters in the fiction, right?<br/><br/>To have a conflict of interest, the NPC needs an agenda of their own that could clash with player characters. I'll call these guys "named characters" to distinguish them from faceless extras (security guards and so on) which don't have agendas of their own. Extras are just furniture which can be used as tools by the named characters if needed. Of course, you can consider 'environmental antagonists' to be named characters with their own agenda as well (A cliff that wishes to throw any who climb it onto the jagged rocks below, for example).<br/><br/>OK?<br/><br/>So as I see it, you resolve at the smallest scale where the player's goal would interfere with any named NPC's agenda. Smaller than that, and the PC don't have anybody to conflict with. Bigger than that, and you are ignoring the agendas of some of your NPCs. I think using "how" and "why" is a great technique to get to this scale.<br/><br/>Does that help any with finding a "stop" point? </blockquote>
Okay, well this got me thinking about something I've been working on for a while design-wise. I've been working on some kind of resolution system, but I guess it isn't really conflict res, at least as described by Warren.<br/><br/>Basically, it's more like, um, an on the fly choose-your-own-adventure style resolution. Each player chooses a possible outcome to a conflict, but the resolution chooses between them. The ablities/qualities of the characters suggest possible outcomes but aren't directly based upon them. Rather, the outcomes are all up at the player level. Is this then still conres, or a different animal?                </div>

                            Does it matter? Is it worth it? If after so many years it is still not clear what exactly Conflict Resolution is supposed to mean, the obvious answer is to get rid of the term and look for something better.                        </div>

<p>Stefan: how is conflict resolution hard? Seems pretty simple to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I do this? (Task Resolution)</li>
<li>Do I win? (Conflict Resolution)</li>
</ul>
<p>The confusion arises apparently because many people can't accept that all rpgs have both task and conflict resolution; it's just that some games focus more on one than on the other, and some games have more details in the process of one than in the other.</p>
<p>Now, what I don't understand is komradebob's proposal. I think I need more information, maybe an example of what this procedure would be. My guess would be that it is "Detail Resolution", which should probably be referred to as event generation instead: neither "Can I do this?" nor "Do I win?" but "What happens next?"</p>
<p>I tried something like that with Serpentine Thunder in the (November?) Ronnies last year. Not sure if it works, but it's the kind of thing I'm interested in.</p>

                            talysman:<br/>"Event generation"- Hmm. Not a bad term at all. "What happens next" is pretty darn close to what I'm getting at.<br/><br/>Mind you, this is for a kid+parent type intro game I was working on, although ultimately I want to make a bit more meay version for adult gamers.<br/><br/>Basically, a player frames a scene. There's a suggested conflict. Scene is played out until some sort of crisis/boiling point is reached. At that point, any player can identify the conflict and suggest an out come. The other players then offer variant outcomes based on that. Because it's meant for kids, I suggest the following variant starters " Yes, but...", Yes, and.." and "But instead". ( That all assumes the initially identified conflict is accepted by the group and they agree to go with resolution-side issue for right now). Once all outcomes are offered, a colored bead is randomly drawn from a bowl. The player whose bead was drawn has their outcome come into play, and any after-effects are played out and the scene closed.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing: All of that stff is up at the player level. Even though it is affected by precedent from earlier scenes and general descriptions of characters, it doesn't look like the same thing as what warren described as con-res ( which seems like a pretty reasonable description). Here, all of the deciding is up at the player level, and characters may or may not be in conflict. Make more sense, or should I give an example from AP?                        </div>

<p>I reread Warren's comment and I'm just not seeing it. I don't think conflict resolution requires conflict between characters instead of between players. I say: you have a good idea, so just go with it, even if it doesn't fit into one particular interpretation of what resolution should do.</p>
