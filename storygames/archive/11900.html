I'm actually a relative newcomer to the group, and as far as I know their RPG history is entirely D&amp;D with maybe some other trad stuff on occasion.  It's a pretty action-oriented group, and Danger Patrol is increasingly my quick-draw game of choice, so I printed out some style/role sheets and we were off.<br/><br/>The guys took to the system and the setting pretty quickly, as expected, and came up with these characters:<br/><br/>Matt played <b>Oh-Bummer 2000</b>, an Atomic Detective, who was also the immortal cyborg body of President Obama.  His life had been shattered in the Atomic Wars, and he spent his spare time outside of Danger Patrol attempting to build consensus among garbage robots to work for a better tomorrow.  I have no idea where Matt gets this stuff.  Uniform colors:  red, white and hope.<br/><br/>Rich played <b>Dead Rex Johnson</b>, Ghost Agent, a Vietnam veteran who had died in World War II.  Yes, you read that right.  His commitment to serving his country was unwavering even in death.  Uniform colors:  black and gray.<br/><br/>John played <b>Jergen Gyroslinger</b>, a Mystic Flyboy and pilot of the <b>Gravy Boat</b>, their entropic Millennium Falconlike vehicle (it constantly looked like it was disintegrating, and could interface with his eldritch energies).  I was a little surprised to see this combo from someone new to the game, but it worked amazingly well in play.  Uniform colors: dark blue and gold.<br/><br/>Ben played <b>Mesa Boogie</b>, Alien Daredevil, whose series of escalating dares with his twin brother had led them from their home planet to Rocket City and then driven a wedge between them.  He picked a regenerative version of Internal Repair Systems for his Alien power. Uniform colors: black and green.  (The game would go on to produce convincing evidence that he was basically a Battletoad.)<br/><br/><i>Last time, on Danger Patrol!</i><br/><br/>Oh-Bummer 2000 spent a sad day handing out leaflets to garbage cans!  I hadn't quite explained the flashback mechanic properly at this point, I think.<br/><br/>Dead Rex Johnson was stalking his archenemy Goldeneye, an arms dealer (yes, with one gold eye) to the Crimson Republic, only to see his main squeeze Hotlegs McGee attempting to make a deal with him!  In a rage, he blew the whole place up and grabbed her as he escaped to safety, haranguing her for her betrayal.  (She was, it turned out, just working as a triple agent.)<br/><br/>Jergen Gyroslinger was running privateer missions against Goldeneye's organization, the Steel Syndicate, stealing their ill-gotten gains back from them.  On one mission, he retrieved only a crate covered in labels that said "DANGER" in thirty languages, which he couldn't open...<br/><br/>Mesa Boogie goaded his brother into taking a slingshot ride on a pneumatic hypercrane, only to see him disappear over the horizon and search frantically for him without result.<br/><br/><b>Act One</b><br/><br/>I was struck by both John's idea of their transport as a Falcon-like smuggler ship and one of the titles on the episode sheet, so I decided to start very much in medias res with a captured-ship-on-the-battle-station game:  <i>Captives of the Thiefstar</i>.  After a pitched battle and a huge explosion, our heroes awoke to find three of them in a crackling electro-cage guarded by Coppertop droid soldiers--while nearby, a sinister Molybdenum Lord was preparing to interrogate Jergen about the Danger Crate's whereabouts in the Chamber of Pain!<br/><br/>This, of course, was exactly where our heroes wanted to be.<br/><br/>Mesa risked life and limb to charge directly through the electrocage, while Dead Rex phased through the floor and Bummer tried to melt Jergen's shackles with his Atomic Beam.  It didn't quite work, but it was enough of a gap for Jergen to jinx all the electronics in the room and break free.  A pitched battle made enough noise to summon a brigade of Silver Agents; Bummer accidentally smashed a hole through an airlock, exposing the whole chamber to hard vacuum; and Dead Rex's ghostly chorus (intended to make the soldiers vibrate at their weak-point frequency) accidentally summoned a nine-mouthed Spacebeast from beyond the grave.  A very solid start!<br/><br/>With opportunities for Detective, Agent and Flyboy rolls pretty thin in the battle, they ended up rolling Danger and hits at about equal levels.  This actually worked out nicely, since they all had their Danger meters up to Injured pretty fast, but there weren't any serious consequences.  At length, they detonated the soldiers, tossed the Spacebeast out the hole and sealed it, and regrouped to figure out where the hell they were: aboard the Steel Syndicate's giant battle station, the Thiefstar.<br/><br/>My goal for the Suspense scene was to reward them for enduring resource deprivation (besides the ill-suited roles, their gear and weapons had all been taken, except Rex's hidden stuff) with lots of opportunities to use Detective and Agent in the course of getting the ship back.  This actually worked a little too well; they blew through the investigations in a couple rolls and determined that they were on an enormous battleship/station heading straight to Rocket City, and that a mile-long ventilation shaft straight down to its center would take them right to the captive Gravy Boat.  Dead Rex slapped together Coppertop costumes for Bummer and Mesa, then set up a holographic version of the Molybdenum Lord, and down they went to get a good fix so Jergen could teleport right down to the ship.<br/><br/>The Gravy Boat was already in the clutches of the mighty Disassembler--overseen by Goldeneye himself!  He bought their disguises wholesale, but the guys got impatient with all this sneaking around and started blasting away almost immediately.  Jergen got into the ship and turned its weapons on the Disassembler, despite a dangerous fuel leak; Goldeneye scrambled off to fight another day, and they blasted out of the hangar only to run smack into the vengeful Spacebeast.  (My second Disaster of the game!  The guys rolled pretty low in this fight, even while using their primary roles, which filled me with glee.)  Triumphant, they raced away from the station and back to warn Rocket City.<br/><br/><b>Act Two</b><br/><br/>We did a quick interlude on the ship, then the guys split up to chase two leads:  Jergen and Mesa went to take a closer look at the Danger Crate while Dead Rex and Bummer went to Rocket City Hall to warn the Mayor.  No sooner had they stormed in than they found Hotlegs McGee, who worked there, having a meeting with a mysterious figure--one with a mustache, and a patch over the golden eye they'd blasted in their last battle!<br/><br/>Bummer ripped off the mustache (with a dangerous roll to make sure it really was him) and revealed Goldeneye, who fled in a puff of ninja smoke.  Hotlegs, ashamed of herself for having been fooled, told the two of them that he'd been shipping in some kind of crates direct to the Mayor's office.  Meanwhile, back at the Danger Lair, Mesa managed to tear open their own crate and find that it wasn't dangerous at all: it was filled with the highest-density supergold in the galaxy.<br/><br/>They returned to pick up Bummer and Rex in the Gravy Boat, and on approach, found that a huge mercenary army was formed up directly behind City Hall--and launching to rendezvous with the Thiefstar on the way to the Crimson Republic.  It would be open war unless the Danger Patrol could stop them!<br/><br/><b>Act Three</b><br/><br/>This is where they started rolling really, really improbably well.  Granted, most of the troop was in x2 or x3 territory and making heavy use of their traits, but through most of the ensuing battle they came up with zero or one danger on almost every roll.  I only got to attempt one full hit (which Rex handily countered with his Ghost power) and introduce one new Threat the whole battle.<br/><br/>So Bummer and Rex leapt from the Gravy Boat directly onto the surface of the Thiefstar and headed for its control deck, while Jergen and Mesa went to engage the fleet directly.  Highlights of the battle included:\n<ul><li>Rex taking ghostly possession of a Molybdenum Mecha</li>\n<li>Bummer using a fusion overload to punch through five-foot-thick control deck glass and smash the Weak Point button</li>\n<li>Jergen risking his ship to draw one battleship's fire toward the Thiefstar</li>\n<li>Mesa leaping onto one battle skiff, taking the controls, ramming it into the other battleship and leaping clear onto a second skiff--which he then used to push the faltering Gravy Boat out of range of the exploding Thiefstar</li></ul>\nThat last roll was the interesting one.  It was the only Disaster of the whole battle, but the battle had reached its peak and the ship going down in flames didn't really fit.  Instead, I had them escape the fireball and limp back to Mars, where the Rocket City Rockettes were formed up to welcome them home.  A giant broadcast screen showed the Mayor's face smiling at them--and ordering the Danger Patrol arrested for high treason!<br/><br/>This is where the pizza arrived, so we ended up not doing a Next Time On.  Instead we discussed how they felt about the game, and the reaction was even more positive than I'd hoped.  I expected a certain amount of permission-seeking, and that was definitely present, but they picked up pretty quickly that the answer to "can I do this?" was always going to be "shit yeah you can."  After that was when they started pulling insane balls-out space battle stunts, and displaying visible glee when they all rolled nothing but hits.<br/><br/>I don't have any intention of trying to drift this group toward full-on Story Game territory; we started playing together because we liked the crunchiness of 4E and we're all pretty satisfied with that experience, and I have other places to get my fill of hope-stabbing.  It's nice to have introduced an indie game and had such a good experience, though.  The action-orientation and willful cheesiness made it a very easy transition.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf" title="Gavinwulf"><img alt="Gavinwulf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf">Gavinwulf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265765/#Comment_265765" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T08:50:41+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  8:50AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome game!

Danger Patrol is a game I really want to play, since I can't right now, I really enjoy reading others' play experiences.<br/><br/>Question: In the first encounter it looked like the PCs were getting beat up pretty good, rolling lots of Danger, etc. Did you as the GM pull any of your punches at all or did you feel like you could totally go balls out with the RAW and attack them?<br/><br/>Also, how did you handle Danger in the Suspense scenes?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265773/#Comment_265773" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T09:39:36+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  9:39AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't feel the need to pull punches at all; with four players, and since it was the opening scene with no accumulated Danger and all their traits available, I was pretty sure the math had them coming out on top regardless.  I will say that I picked some mid-range power levels for threats that might have seemed more dangerous than they were--the Spacebeast was a 6, the Molybdenum Lord was a 10--but the important thing to remember is that those numbers (like hit points) are mostly a pacing mechanism, whereas the four Threat Levels are the real indication of what you can do to the PCs.  I cackled with glee every time the players rolled enough Danger for a new threat or a full hit, even if those full hits were mostly Bashes.<br/><br/>With regard to Danger in the Suspense scenes, honestly, I mostly blew it off; I might have inflicted a Bashed hit or two from diving down that mile-long vent shaft.  Nobody rolled terribly high on any of them (that was the Detective/Agent dice coming into play).  The Disassembler might have spawned from a Disaster roll during Suspense, but since there's no point-buy for the GM when creating Threats for a new scene, that was as much color as mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf" title="Gavinwulf"><img alt="Gavinwulf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gavinwulf">Gavinwulf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265828/#Comment_265828" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T16:25:43+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  4:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see that Danger accumulates throughout the 'episode'.

Did this seem pretty intuitive for you to balance through the session? I know this was probably your first play of the game so I realize more experience is probably necessary.

I read the links, very cool, I especially liked your first session. I believe my questions about pacing have been answered, in that the players really control that by how much danger dice they choose. They either play safe and take reduced hits that bump up to the next level, or they can do some crazy shiz and risk a Full hit or Disaster- which ramps up the fun factor anyhow. <br/>I live in a rural town but maybe if some family is bored enough I can talk them into a game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Please post any more play reports!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266488/#Comment_266488" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T15:39:12+00:00" title="April 10, 2010  3:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice recap, Brendan!  Sounds like a good time.  I'm going to run Danger Patrol again for some 4E buddies of mine weekend after next.  Expecting it to go fairly well and have a strong Venture Bros. vibe given the audience.  Will incorporate the updated Interlude-refresh rule.<br/><br/>How long was the session and what do you think about the differences between 3 PCs and 4 PCs?<br/><br/>One thing I'm curious to see the outcome on when running DP for my 4E group is they have a higher tolerance for the five+ hour session - a gameplay length that I and <i>most</i> of my S-G'er type playmates don't generally care for.  Curious to see how DP handles in that kind of time frame, albeit with three new players who are mostly unaccustomed to improvising game world details on the fly.<br/><br/><i>Oh-Bummer 2000... groan...</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
