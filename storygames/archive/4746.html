I'll just go through the memories for all four players, and go through all their questions before moving to the next one. Since we went in the same order for all three memories, I'll go Player 1-4.  I'm Player 1, but I'll write all the memories in first person. My comments will be in parenthesis.<br/><br/>We went to some crazy places, but had a blast doing it.<br/><br/>Sidenote to Paul: I'll write up some feedback on the Ashcan Front and possibly more detailed stuff in email.<br/><br/><b>Player 1</b><br/>1st Seed: tape stuck to fingers.<br/><br/>This memory was about how I was in a school for gifted children. My project was a mess, and I was embarassed for feeling like my project was a mess. But Susie Tillerman helped me clear away the mess and see how good my finished project was.  <br/><br/>I remembered when I got a crush on Susie.<br/><br/>2nd seed: Hope.<br/><br/>I was getting ready for something, getting married to a woman named Hope (a wonderful twist). Susie was the maid of honor and I was still in love with her. But despite my cold feet, I married Hope. <br/><br/>I remembered the day I married the wrong woman.<br/><br/>3rd seed: A christmas stocking.<br/><br/>It was christmas, and the stocking was a reminder of an illicit affair.  I had been seeing Susie ever since the wedding, before it, even.  My kids were all there, but their mother wasn't, and I was wondering where she was. She finally showed up and it was Susie. I was spending Christmas Eve with her instead of my wife Hope. This felt more like family, so after the holidays I decided to make a choice. I bought tickets, so that we could leave the country, making up a story that we needed to get out. But in the airport, as our boarding numbers were called, I realized I was making the same mistake again. But I didn't have the heart to admit my false marriage.  So instead I forgot it all.<br/><br/>I chose to remember.<br/><br/><b>Player 2</b><br/>1st Seed: hot chocolate and marshmallows<br/><br/>I was sitting at a desk working on a deadline, outside it was cold and miserable. I finished off a whole pot of coffee, and my secretary forgot how much I love my coffee and need it to work, made some hot chocolate instead. I called her in and berated her. I loved making her cry. She wasn't at her desk when a client rushed in, dripping wet. He wanted to hire me for something. I relished yelling at my secretary some more before expelling her from my office. I offered the client a seat. He had a job for me.  <br/><br/>I remember the day I went on retainer for the Giambini crime family.<br/><br/>2nd Seed: Two soldiers folding a flag<br/><br/>They were burying my son. I was paid by another family to have him killed. He was the grandson to the Giambini Don, and heir apparent to the city, because my wife was the Don's daughter. The Godfather told me that I was a dead man. But I smiled and told him that I was going to take him down first. The men around him reached into their pockets as I reached into mine. I pulled out a key, showed it to him, and walked away. That key matched a locker in the airport.  Inside was a stash of money, photos, and blackmail material, enough to ensure my position as the King of Chicago.<br/><br/>I remember the day I traded my son's life for power.<br/><br/>3rd Seed: A hot air balloon with a happy face.<br/><br/>In that balloon was a sniper. It was my son. (even though he had been established as dead, the hot air balloon broke the serious tone  for us and we decided that he wasn't a Godfather character, but a Batman villain) It was the opening ceremonies of the world's fair. The balloon wasn't a . He was going to help me fake my death, like I had faked his so many years ago. As I stood on the stage and started my speech, my wife stood behind me. A shot rang out, and I ducked reflexively. But it was only the man being shot out of the canon into a net, also with my face on it, signalling the openning of the fair. But I also saw the basket of the balloon swaying. My wife had shot our son. Backstage, I pulled a gun on her, as she tried to convince me that it was for the better. That we'd rule the city together. I fired the pistol, hitting my former secretary, now assistant to my wife. "I guess that makes us even," she said. "I guess it does," I replied. We walked out together, to rule the city. As we stepped onto the stage, a shot rang out from the balloon. My son's dying action was to fire a shot at me. But my wife dived in front to take the bullet.  Unforunately, it passed through her exploding head, and right into me. As I lay, bleeding, I forgot everything.<br/><br/>I chose not to remember.<br/><br/>(Continued...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106883/#Comment_106883" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T20:02:32+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:02PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2007 8:02PM by Jogesh EZ.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (...continued)<br/><br/><b>Player 3</b><br/>1st Seed: A warm sensation on the back of the neck<br/><br/>I was in the hospital for tuberculosis (the symptoms of which don't adhere to reality, but we agreed not to have that hold us back) getting a sponge bath. Unfortunately he wasn't the cut female nurse that had been in earlier changing my IV bags. I had been in the hospital for a month. But for the first time, I found myself able to breathe deeply. I stood up. The doctor came in, and couldn't believe what he was seeing. I got dressed, and left the hospital. The cold rain outside was soothing on my fevered skin.<br/><br/>I remember when I was miraculously healed when I had tuberculosis.<br/><br/>2nd Seed: A duck (and this is the one that sent us more into silly stories as a group)<br/><br/>I came home from the hospital and found my pet duck had gained apparently mystical powers. He greeted me when I came home, he was sitting next to the ashes of my friend. The duck, was my best friend Hank. He died from tuberculosis, or so I thought.  It turns out, he had a "cure" of sorts. He slipped a drug into the IV bags and had the cute nurse swap them in just so I would come home. His cure was to transer his mind into the body of a duck. He led me to the lab where he did the work and revealed a caged pheasant. He had it all set up for me.<br/><br/>I remember when I had to decide between becoming a bird or staying human with a terminal disease.<br/><br/>3rd seed: taste of coconut milk<br/><br/>I remember that coconut milk tasted good with duck, but it wasn't on the menu yet. Next to me on one side, was Hank's body's ashes, on the other side was Hank the duck. It was a farewell dinner for me with all my friends and family. Hank and I read a prepared speech, revealing his duck form to everyone. Hank also revealed that he had seeded TB into the food everyone was eating, so they too would fall ill now. And I stood up and released the virus on the entire city. Hank opened up a panel to reveal cage after cage of pheasants. Everyone I ever knew and loved (a phrase we repeated throughout this memory) looked up at me with shock and horror. My high school biology teacher, who also worked at night for the Tesla Laboratory of Electromagnetic Transference, came forward and said they had been doing research, and discovered that mind transference can be done selectively, you can get only partial memories instead of full memories. So I strapped Hank down and began to absorb his memories, to figure out a way out of the crazy plan I was going along with. But I turned it too high, and I absorbed everyone's memories in the room! My head was about to explode with pain, but within it I found out that Hank had been patient zero. His ashes could be the cure if prepared right. With the absorbed memories, I had that method. So I turned the switch, returning the memories, but I turned it too far and my consciousness faded. I had a vision of a tropical beach and a coconut tree. I came back to the present moment. I wrestled Hank into the kitchen and chopped him up into a coconut milk curry, my grandmother's recipe that I had remembered during the brief absorption. I was cured, and in my victory dance, I slipped on the mess in the room, hitting my head, and forgetting it all.<br/><br/>I chose to remember.<br/><br/>(Continued...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106884/#Comment_106884" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-05T20:03:01+00:00" title="November  5, 2007  8:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (...continued)<br/><br/><b>Player 4</b><br/>1st seed: Niagra Falls<br/><br/>I remember when I was sent to Niagra Falls for a calendar shoot. It was a crap job, but I needed the money if I ever wanted to start my own photography studio. I brought my sister with me. She had never been. When I got there, the weather was terrible for taking pictures, and it was packed with tourists. But I saw that there was a tightrope stretched across the falls, and my sister climbed over the railing and crossed. I cheered her on. She made it safely to the other side. I decided to follow. I took out my camera and took pictures from the tightrope.<br/><br/>I remember when my sister inspired me to push myself to my limits.<br/><br/>2nd seed: Elvis Presley<br/><br/>I remember a 100 foot tall velvet Elvis painting in my new studio. Investors had given me money for my own project, which was a artist of the 50's photographic art piece. A bungie jump was set up at the top of the Elvis. But we stretched the budget too tight and we hadn't been able to procure the safety equipment yet. My boyfriend clumbed up to the top to jump, and I yelled "Nooooo!" but he couldn't hear me from way down there and thought I was telling him to "Go!" He jumped and the ropes began to give way. So I dived in front of him to try and catch him. He said he wanted to end it in the ambulance ride. After I got out of surgery, I wheeled myself to his room. We needed to talk. When I got there, he was getting a sponge bath from a cute nurse named Hope. In my fury I charged him with my wheel chair and impaled him with my cast.<br/><br/>I remember when I flew into a murderous rage at my ex-boyfriend.<br/><br/>3rd seed: a bowl of gazpacho soup<br/><br/>In prison, they were serving my gazpacho soup in my cell, not in the mess hall. A chef I had bribed to my cause was sneaking me mechanical pieces which I was using to build a pogo stick. Even though I was still in a wheelchair, I planned to escape that way. I got word my sister came to visit. But she hadn't come to visit me in years. Upon seeing her I tried to charge at her with my wheelchair, the hurt and pain of her abandonment coming back, but the prison guard held me back. My sister had news. My boyfriend hadn't died. There was incompetence with the death report, and he was actually alive. I was free. I wanted to mend things with him. He was in a forgiving mood, but when I saw the ring on his finger, suddenly I wasn't. I played the part and brought him back to the studio. He was going to finish the shoot. But this time the rope broke completely. I just wanted to scare him, not head back to prison. I pulled the pogo stick like a samurai sword from the back of my wheelchair. I bounced up to catch him.  But just then, the rigged Hunka Hunka Burning Love rockets fired. They were on a timer. Engulfed in flames, we fell to the pool below. "But I never loved you" he mouthed underwater. I made it to the ladder and pulled it out so he had to tread water and listen. And asked him why he wanted to hurt me. But just then, the fire caused the 100 foot Elvis to collapse. I dove back in to try and save him. But I forgot to put the ladder back. And burning Elvis on top of us, I forgot everything.<br/><br/>I chose not to remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106980/#Comment_106980" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T09:14:35+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  9:14AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
