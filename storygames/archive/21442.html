I wonder if it is possible to craft an effective combat system for Wuxia using these virtues but in the manner stances are employed in the aforementioned game. Do you think this could work? Do you think it's even necessary?<br/><br/>Courage - if the hero is facing down enemies. The Difficulty is low, modified by the number of targets, but if the hero fails he takes damage in response. The hero distributes damage to all the enemies he targeted. Perhaps this is what you use if you wish to fight mooks or minions<br/><br/>Loyalty - the hero is helping his allies. The Difficulty is average, again one can be Captain if multiple heroes take this tactic. Alternatively a hero helping can assist a Courageous hero in attack or defence with a bonus equal to his Loyalty. This must be declared prior to the attack being made. This can be declared out of turn order and replaces any turn this hero may take during the round.<br/><br/>Compassion - the hero is helping an NPC in the environment. The Difficulty is average but modified by the number of enemies present. If successful the hero may employ an appropriate ability or effect. Same as Loyalty but for NPC's not other heroes.<br/><br/>Justice - the hero is engaging an enemy one on one. The difficulty is low, but if the hero fails he takes damage in response. His damage applies solely to one target. Maybe this move should be for taking on Villains or Masterminds, not the mooks, and the damage and difficulty could thus be higher.<br/><br/>Wisdom - a hero is attempting to circumvent conflict somehow, either to avoid being hit, or to interact with something - a trap or object in the environment perhaps. The difficulty is average but modified by the number of enemies present.<br/><br/>This system would have heroes (PC's) having scores in these Virtues. So a Courageous character is better suited to fighting against the odds (duh) than a Loyal hero, who might be a monk or a healer.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469238/#Comment_469238" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T21:29:04+00:00" title="January 23, 2018  9:29PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know the rules, but balancing is generally the difficult part.

(Wisdom is good, though - it has a clear direction which is different from the others.)<br/><br/>What I would want to see, instead of modifiers to the difficulty level (which really means I'm going to want to shoehorn in the strongest Virtue much of the time), is how using any given Virtue changes the possible outcomes, and what costs or complications it brings.<br/><br/>That would make the choice of Virtue/stance much more interesting, and for it to have narrative repercussions.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469242/#Comment_469242" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T22:03:28+00:00" title="January 23, 2018 10:03PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This would map pretty well to the way The One Ring uses stances.<br/><br/>The specific effects of your stance in TOR are:<br/>1. When you take your turn<br/>2. Hit difficulty (applies both for your roll to hit foes and their roll to hit you)<br/>3. What alternative combat actions are available to you (e.g. intimidate, encourage allies, ranged attacks).<br/><br/>Seems like that's very similar to your plan for wuxia virtues.<br/><br/>Would you really want to tie it directly to basic abilities though? One of the strengths of TOR is that the stances encourage characters to switch around as needed tactically. But if one wuxia character is always going to be best at one thing, you lose that assessment/choice element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469245/#Comment_469245" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T22:39:55+00:00" title="January 23, 2018 10:39PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't this basically <i>In a Wicked Age</i>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469246/#Comment_469246" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T22:49:14+00:00" title="January 23, 2018 10:49PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>In a Wicked Age...</i> is a pretty odd and particular case, since the long-term reward cycle rewards you for choosing suboptimal stats to use.

Rather, having high Compassion only makes it more likely that you get to use the stance in this situation at all. A cold-hearted character may find that they are forced to do something else, work with their anger or whatnot instead.<br/><br/>This kind of set-up doesn't suffer of minmaxing locking characters into individual stances because your "protect others" stance is still only going to be useful in situations where you're trying to protect something. When you're doing something else, you'll need to try for another stance. Even when protecting others your Compassion only makes you reliable, not necessarily overpowering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469255/#Comment_469255" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-24T19:03:31+00:00" title="January 24, 2018  7:03PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, but i think that might slow things down and just put too much weight on what should be a simple thing.

You could do things like allowing characters to attack a number of enemies at once equal to their Courage score, or whenever they attack one enemy, any nearby enemies take damage equal to their Courage score.<br/><br/>Depending on how much mechanical depth you're looking for, I would look to 4e and 13th Age for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469632/#Comment_469632" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-04T09:46:39+00:00" title="February  4, 2018  9:46AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 4, 2018 9:51AM by Rafu.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also have a look at how "passions" work in <i><a href="http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/" rel="nofollow">Anima Prime</a></i>: each main character picks a dominant passion, and that passion both defines them and comes with specific rule-tweaks attached (like a D&amp;D "feat" or perhaps class feature).

Those are all quite particular to how in-game combat resources are handled in <i>Anima Prime</i> - typically, they establish a character-specific rule for how Wounds (suffered, inflicted, healed or suffered by others) interact with Charge Dice (a currency then spent to activate attack and support powers).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470034/#Comment_470034" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-16T13:16:50+00:00" title="February 16, 2018  1:16PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" rel="nofollow">ghostwhistler</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For example: a Courageous hero can attack multiple enemies simultaneously.

The only question is if there is a particular reason you want to tie those abilities to those virtues (also will each character have a single ability based on their virtue, or will there be a range of abilities available to them). <br/><br/>I think what you should do at this stage is just put material on paper, make character sheets and start running playtests to see if the concepts work the way you want them to in play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
