One reason I run the same games repeatedly is so that I can change 1 variable per game and see how that affects play. Sometimes I will interview players afterward to confirm, revise, or reconsider my observations. I have lots of notes and theories but before I posted any here, I wanted to make sure that was in line with what you are looking for.

This is especially the case in opening scenes, but it can happen at any point in the episode. It\u2019s tempting for Watchtower to turn to the player and ask, \u201cWould your character be in Lex\u2019s underground lair?\u201d The impulse is noble, but the question is bad news. Asking a \u201cyes or no\u201d question doesn\u2019t encourage the player to get his own creative contribution in there. You\u2019re putting the player into a situation where he may feel his only option is a flat no\u2014and \u201cno\u201d is death to collaboration.<br/><br/>Instead of asking if, ask why. \u201cWhy is your character in Lex\u2019s underground lair?\u201d Maybe he\u2019s decided to sneak in on his own. Maybe he\u2019s following a lead for a headline and stumbled into the lair. Maybe he was captured and brought there. By shifting the question from \u201cif\u201d to \u201cwhy,\u201d not only do you sidestep the possibility of a flat \u201cno,\u201d but you open up the question and make the player part of the decision-making process.</blockquote>Cam Banks, Josh Roby - <i>SMALLVILLE</i>, p51<br/><br/><b><span style="font-size: large; font-size: large;">FRAMING AFTER ARRIVAL</span></b>\n<blockquote>If every scene opens with the Leads walking into the room, things are going to get really repetitive really quickly. Half the time, Watchtower knows exactly what the Leads intend to do\u2014often because they\u2019ve said as much at the table\u2014so it\u2019s a simple matter to cut out empty time. If, for instance, Clark\u2019s player tells Oliver that he\u2019s going to check the Daily Planet archives, Watchtower could frame the scene with Clark walking into those archives. To mix things up, though, you could just as easily frame the scene with Clark walking out of the archives only to bump into Lois\u201a who might be curious why he\u2019s digging up old issues from the 1920-1929 stacks.<br/><br/>Not to get ahead of ourselves, but you might wonder about Watchtower giving Clark the information he\u2019s after for \u201cfree\u201d because she\u2019s skipped over the die roll by framing the scene after he\u2019s found something. However, the moment Lois asks, \u201cSo whatcha got in your hot little hand there?\u201d and Clark needs to answer, you can call for a quick Test to see what he found. Maybe he found exactly the right article and he has the microfiche in hand. Maybe he hasn\u2019t found a thing and the articles he\u2019s printed out are all red herrings.</blockquote>Cam Banks, Josh Roby - <i>SMALLVILLE</i>, p51<br/><br/><b><span style="font-size: large; font-size: large;">IN MEDIAS RES</span></b>\n<blockquote>Call this an advanced technique if you like, but kicking off a scene in medias res (\u201cin the middle of things\u201d) is a sure-fire way to cut right to the action. This requires a little trust on the part of the players and a lot of insight on the part of Watchtower, but when this technique works, it sings.<br/><br/>The trick is knowing what the players want to do. Hopefully they\u2019ll be telegraphing this pretty clearly to you and the rest of the table as they confer and plan among themselves. Pay attention to what they tell each other to expect and what they ask each other to prepare for. Over time, your group will get certain feel for the shape of an episode and how plot lines tend to play out. All of that put together can sometimes let you see a couple scenes into the future. Once you know where their stories are going, all you need to do is wait for the opportunity to jump ahead.<br/><br/>The big hurdle in starting scenes in medias res is inadvertently skipping over something that a player wanted to do before he got himself into trouble. Keep an eye out for points in the game where everyone is suited up and ready, eyeing the <br/>horizon resolutely. You can coast forward on that kind of energy skipping past the \u201cyou show up, break in, and down a couple unsuspecting guards\u201d to get to the meat of the scene (although sometimes you\u2019re skipping the \u201cyou show up and leave your name with the hostess, then you wait for awhile until they seat you and serve you appetizers\u201d). When you see an opportunity, kick the scene into gear with fast-paced, pressing action that requires the Leads to act.<br/><br/>If, despite your best efforts, you skip a little too far ahead and a player says, \u201cBut I wanted to\u2014\u201d just hand him a Plot Point. Tell him to spend it on revealing his planned preparations in the middle of the scene. With luck, he\u2019ll surprise the rest of the table with an unforeseen turn of events.</blockquote>Cam Banks, Josh Roby - <i>SMALLVILLE</i>, p51<br/><br/><b><span style="font-size: large; font-size: large;">CUT BEFORE THE SECOND LULL</span></b>\n<blockquote>There\u2019s an ebb and flow to a scene, with the dialogue coming hot and fast, the dice getting broken out, gloating and cheering and tense confrontations. And then sometimes things start to drag. That\u2019s okay; your players may need to absorb what\u2019s happened and figure out which direction they\u2019re going next. Give them that moment, because a good pivot makes for a great scene. Things will pick up again right after and proceed onwards. The trick is to cut before the scene hits that second lull. One pivot makes for a good scene; two pivots make for a muddy mess. If things start slowing down again, it\u2019s time to move on.</blockquote>Cam Banks, Josh Roby - <i>SMALLVILLE</i>, p52<br/><br/><b><span style="font-size: large; font-size: large;">TELEGRAPHING</span></b>\n<blockquote>Telegraphing is essential for making your Smallville Roleplaying Game sing. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of describing what your character does without revealing why he\u2019s doing it or what his motivations are. Sure, the other characters in the scene may not know these things, but the audience\u2014that\u2019s your fellow players around the game table\u2014should be seeing the hesitations, the significant looks, the set of your character\u2019s shoulders. This helps the audience get to know the characters and get a feel for what they\u2019re about and how they solve problems.<br/><br/>As the character\u2019s player, it\u2019s your job to help the audience\u2014all those real live people sitting next to you\u2014understand what your character is after. If all you do is describe what your character does and a few circuitous lines of dialogue, you\u2019re letting them down. Not everybody needs to be as direct as Clark \u201cTell me how you have video of my living room!\u201d Kent, but you can still describe what your character does and says in a way that makes his intentions clear.</blockquote>Cam Banks, Josh Roby - <i>SMALLVILLE</i>, p54                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311789/#Comment_311789" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T17:51:31+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  5:51PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2011 5:52PM by mease19.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see a book that is 100 essays on good GMing or aspects thereof.

What will the players see that will make them want that too?  How will they be confident that they can try that?"  <br/><br/>Thinking about something from the players' perspective is really important, and difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311887/#Comment_311887" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T12:36:01+00:00" title="February  9, 2011 12:36PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh!

"Could we do that in a way more consistent with..." "Would it be OK if, instead, we..." But don't be a jerk about it.<br/><br/>Shut up when the players are talking among themselves, especially in character, and listen carefully. If you disengage with the conversation and page through your notes, you're not honoring their contributions. This officially makes you a Bad GM, even in the traddest D&amp;D game.<br/><br/>Don't get married to plot elements you've planned out. Don't get married to the idea that the PCs will win, even. (Vincent, in <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i>: 'Practice saying it with me. \u201cHey, so the Crow Mother sinks all the town\u2019s copper barges from now on and the town falls into ruin? Cool with me. Cool with me!') To the extent that you do, you're railroading. The safest kind of plot planning is <i>none at all</i>. The next safest is setting the scene and stopping there. If you can't stop, it's vital to remember not to get married.<br/><br/>If a player makes a big choice, especially one that costs resources or is otherwise hard to change, for instance at character generation, then that's a flag that they want to see that choice matter again later. Don't disappoint your players.<br/><br/>In general, <i>Dogs</i> (get the players contributing, plan lightly, no mechanics without progress in the fiction...). Also <i>Paranoia</i> (reinforce things that entertain you, when you get stuck try looking at a character sheet and making something there the next story element, make the players entertain each other...).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
