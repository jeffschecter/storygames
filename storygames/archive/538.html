<p>Over in the Setting Without The Crap thread (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=527&amp;page=1#Item_32" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=527&amp;page=1#Item_32</a>), it struck me that some of what Shreays is looking for is  Color, and some is Setting. This made me want to say something about Color and prompt discussion about ways to build with Color, but I figured that deserves its own thread,</p>
<p>First, let me state my theory about what Color does: it's the glue that binds together other elements of the game. Setting, as we know, is the essential conflicts implicit in the fictional world, while Characters are people who can potentially be caught in those comments. Setting plus Character yields Situation. Setting helps Situation move forward to become the next Situation. What helps make all this feel "real" and ties Setting to Character, or Setting to System, are the details of Color.</p>
<p>Suppose your Setting is "Political factions in a decadent empire struggle to sieze control and elminate their rivals, usually subtly, but open warfare lurks just at the edge." You're thinking about this as a fantasy version of Renaissance Italy, and start fleshing out Setting with the different factions and their built-in conflicts. What helps cement the idea of what kind of conflicts to expect in the Setting is the Color of pseudo-Italy.  The Color also ties this Setting to the other elements: if you describe typical poisons used in the setting, you are linking the Setting to some potential Situations (attempts to assassinate or foil assassinations;) you may also be linking Setting to Character, if you define the typical Character type as assassins or bodyguards.</p>
<p>What is brewing in my mind, but hasn't quite solidifed into something I can communicate yet, is the idea that generation of Color can be implimented by thinking in terms of what a Color element is supposed tlo link. I'm not sure how yet, but for now, I'll just try to list some subtypes of Color.</p>
<p><em>Scenery</em>: location Color, linking Setting to the players.<br/>
<em>Props</em>: object Color, usually linking Setting to Situation (by what each object is used for, such as swords used for fighting, scrolls for recording spells.) Can also link Character to Setting by acting as identifiers for types of characters (wizard's robes, camouflaged reversible assassin's cloaks.)<br/>
<em>Roles</em>: people Color, linking Character to Setting (Races, Classes) or Situation (Alignment.)<br/>
<em>Traits</em>: action Color, linking Character to System and Situation. These are Skills, Talents, Feats, or anything else characters can actually do.</p>
<p>More later as I ruminate on the implications of all this and how to put it to work...</p>
