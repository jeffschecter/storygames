The idea is that before you run a new game with a group of folks -- even a group of friends -- running a on-shot demo is a good idea to find out if they will like it.  <br/><br/>By "new game" I literally mean a game system you have never played; not merely a new Campaign for a game you're familiar with. I had never considered this for some reason, but it sounds like a better idea than pitching a new game and selling out to it early.<br/><br/>So, I would like to ask the question -- what is the Art behind doing this well?  My first guess would be pregen characters, but maybe for some systems you would want to stay away from pregen characters, even in a demo.  Are some games more difficult to demo than others?<br/><br/>Thanks for any input on demoing well.<br/><br/>-- John M.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296966/#Comment_296966" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-15T04:34:02+00:00" title="October 15, 2010  4:34AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games designed for short, constrained play are obviously easier to demo. Some games really suffer in one-shot form, and the truth is most games get played that way. PTA is a good example of this - playing for a season allows the game's mechanics to shine; as a one-shot it can be a little forced and artificial. Vincent Baker says that Apocalypse World doesn't get really good until you've got six sessions under your collective belt. <br/><br/>Burning Wheel is pretty complex, but it has excellent one-shot demos and explicit instructions for easing into the system over time.<br/><br/>You can get the feel for a lot of games through making characters and having a simple consequence-free fight. Maybe a little morsel of story and situation will emerge, and if it is fun, maybe some folks will want to keep playing those dudes. Either way, it'll give you an idea.<br/><br/>If your new game is going to require a lot of investment from anybody, starting out small is a really good idea. We started playing the new Warhammer, and the deal was this - we'd take a session to make up guys and have a little combat to try out the system, and if that was fun we'd play for an additional four sessions, and if <i>that </i>was fun we'd see what happened. If the fun stops at any point we'll do something else. <br/><br/>Some other threads on demos <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12704" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5210" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6251" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296968/#Comment_296968" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-15T05:24:07+00:00" title="October 15, 2010  5:24AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Big J Money</cite>I picked up a vibe in another thread that resonated strongly because I had never considered the idea before.

I don't know how I didn't find that in searches :-/ ]<br/><br/>[ Edit2: Okay, I don't feel so bad.  All the links are like the ones I visited before: topics about a person knowledgeable about a game demoing for others in a limited amount of time.

Look carefully at the game and try to use progressive engagement. Rather than start out with the players having fully formed characters have them start with just a name and add skills and stats as required. By then end of the session each player will have a fully formed character based on the choices they have made during the game. This type of one shot will take up a lot more time to construct and adjudicate the game. <br/>\n<br/>\n2. Make liberal use of handouts - when someone wants to use a spell or a skill have a quick description and related rules ready so you can quickly go over it and hand the sheet over to the player so they can reference it later in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Manipulate the session such that the spotlight moves quickly from player to player and make sure no one is left on the sidelines too long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
