Classical RPGs tend to be rules-heavy, and that makes it a field of interest for relatively few souls. Modern RPGs is generally much easier to learn and play, with less emphasis on the game-bit, and so it has a better potential amongst non-gamers.<br/><br/>I believe that the modern games of today, and new games in the classical form (with a GM), have a greater chance of enticing a broader public. I believe they may  be more open invitations to the engaging practice of dialogue based, creative interaction.<br/><br/>- How do we muster the potential presented in modern RPGs?<br/>- Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_192546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192546/#Comment_192546" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T00:40:40+00:00" title="February 14, 2009 12:40AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RPGs should be like parlor/party games, and I suspect that the first such games (closed room mysteries?) actually were.

What's important is that the rewards of the play experience are commensurate with the investment of creative and social effort required before play can happen. Many traditional games with broken social architectures fail this test. So one solution is to scale back the up front investment, making it match the actual reward magnitude of the play experience. But an equally reasonable, if more challenging solution is to optimize the rewards of play to match the game's necessary up front creative and social investment.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192584/#Comment_192584" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T11:06:46+00:00" title="February 14, 2009 11:06AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, while I agree, what do you do when each player gets a different reward from the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192601/#Comment_192601" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T14:04:55+00:00" title="February 14, 2009  2:04PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And perhaps even more importantly, what do you do when the players abandon their homes and families to pursue this new, improved gaming?
