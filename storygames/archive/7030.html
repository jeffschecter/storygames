At first blush, you'd think that the gatekeeping features of it would be stuff that folks would be happy to be rid of:  They want to do X, they get to do X, they don't need anyone to tell them that they are allowed to do X.  Sounds all western and empowered and like that, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nExcept for one thing:  "I want to do X, I do X" is a series of actions that take place without involving another person.  "I want to do X, the GM <i>listens to what I want and judges it</i> and then tells me I can do X, I do X" is forging a link of connection.  The GM has to listen ... they <i>have to</i> pay attention.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means that if you, the player, are worried that none of your fellow non-GM-players are paying any attention to the cool things you're doing, <i>at least</i> you know that the GM is listening.  He has to be.  It's his job.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, the more "power" the GM has to permit or deny, the more attention he has to be paying.  In <i>Feng Shui</i> I can sort of lackadaisically say "Oh, rolling on a desert cart while firing two handguns ... that's your standard +2 for a stunt."  In (say) <i>Amber</i>, I have to be judging it more critically:  Is this enough to overcome the bare one rank of Warfare difference between the targets?  I mean, it was pretty cool, but sorta standard ... and yet, it fits into the whole John Woo setting that we're working with here ... I should get doves involved in this!  Yeah, I'm gonna make this a standoff and start hinting at the presence of doves, and then if he does something cool with <b>that</b> then that'll be worth ... etc., etc."<br/>\n<br/>\nWith great power comes great responsibility, and in the GMs case can it really be described as anything but the responsibility to <i>listen</i>?  The GM is the default audience that makes games work even when people don't know how to be a good audience for each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I crazy?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni" title="First Oni"><img alt="First Oni" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni">First Oni</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156398/#Comment_156398" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T07:39:36+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  7:39AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally agree with this topic's statements, but i'd also like to add that GM listening is beneficial for the player AND the GM. It's his JOB to listen, sure, but they can also turn that listening into great opportunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run most of my games with a loose outline of what I want to happen for my plot/story. For the rest, i kinda point the players in a direction and "listen". Most players think out loud about what they think might happen or ways that certain strategies may play out, giving a GM ammo. These statements would be surrounded by "wouldn't it be cool if XXX happened" or "Oh, i hope it's not XXX behind this door". The GM could make either the good or bad occur and get the same result: the players have a ton of fun and feel the satisfaction of guessing the outcome, even though the GM was just playing off of their own words. The players don't need to know that. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short: Listening is THE best tool for a GM has for running a game.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.thirdeyegames.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdeyegames.net</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156437/#Comment_156437" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T10:36:50+00:00" title="July 14, 2008 10:36AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My (probably too cynical) counterpoint:<br><br>The traditional GM listens, but only so he can sit in judgement and reward or punish accordingly.

I think it's not uncommon to see a play structure comprised of spokes (players) aimed at a hub (the GM), with no meaningful connections between each spoke. GM talks, Player 1 responds. GM talks, Player 2 responds. And so on.<br/><br/>So my thesis goes, the reason the "designated validator" role in traditional RPG play is so durable is because that validation is coming from a parental/authority figure, rather than from a peer.

Not only that, but I think this is one of those things that (to me) is obviously true as soon as it's said.</blockquote>\nThis was my reaction as well.  It also does a lot to explain certain group dynamics.  In many games, something isn't true unless it comes out of the GM's mouth (or, in GM-less play, until they've been vetted by one or more Alpha players).  Even if the players describe something happening, the GM has to re-describe it, in their own words, before it "happens."  The GM-as-listener then becomes GM-as-translator, where player contributions are only validated and accepted after the GM has listened and regurgitated them.  It also points to the critical importance of the "Yes, and/but..." especially the "Yes," part which is a validation of "I listened to what you just said."  If there's no "Yes," sometimes that gets translated as "I'm ignoring your input / concerns" = "you are not important to me."<br/><br/>The ramifications for GM-less play are also interesting. It definitely seems like an important part of GM-less play is making sure the listening role still happens, either that everyone is listening to everyone else (unlikely, in my experience), or that certain people are listening to certain other people and pushing other people's ideas in addition to their own, using their authority to negotiate a situation where everyone has input.  Often times this works because certain people may be better at listening to specific players than others.  For example, I may find all of Player X's contributions to be grating, but Player Y might be able to tease something out of them that the whole group will accept / appreciate, helping us validate Player X's input.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156464/#Comment_156464" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T12:01:26+00:00" title="July 14, 2008 12:01PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally agreed, Bob.

This is probably the most valid design point this discussion has produced. <br/>Taking turns is a great way of handling shared responsibility.<br/>The catch is that those turns need a lot clearer beginning and ending conditions than the average RPG provides.<br/>Nebulous beginnings and endings don't always work. You'd need a much more structured game.<br/><br/>I also agree with Paul B's cynical analyis of the situation and I think you need to take that one further, and back around the tree, to make this clear.<br/><br/>1. The first post mentioned "with great power comes great responsibility" - which doesn't mean that the responsibility is handled all that well in all that many cases.<br/>In fact, I think it's fair to say that people who handled the GM responsibilities poorly may have had something to do with influencing people to come to a site like this.<br/>Being from a country where we vote to split up responsibility, I'm all for less power at a point and more for a mass approach.<br/><br/>2. I suspect that a lot more of the people who would be satisfied with being merely players can get their fix a lot more easily with computer RPGs, which have an inherently fair (or, at least, consistently and predictably unfair) approach. These games certainly do the same thing as a bad GM: sidelining a player's agenda to fit the pre-written outline of their stories, artificially limiting the growth of the character, ignoring you except when you're allowed to answer questions, etc.<br/>That means that there may well be more GMs left out there willing to run games than there are players to participate in them.<br/><br/>3. The maturity level of a group tends to settle at its lowest common denominator. If you've got very immature players, you will have very immature games.<br/>If everyone can contribute equally to those game, however, some of the more immature moments will be counterpointed by the more mature players.<br/><br/>So, if these observations are valid, then, perhaps, the listening skills of the group are, indeed, important to develop. The question then becomes: how do we encourage players to listen to eachother more than the GM?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156536/#Comment_156536" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T17:29:25+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  5:29PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Levi:</b> How about this proposal: "Giving the players mechanical responsibility over something is a quick-and-dirty approach to giving them emotional investment in that thing, but not a complete replacement for it."

And that's the only guideline I've given. It's a rough Fan Mail ripoff of course (insofar as I've explained that "cooler" can extend beyond in-game events), but nobody in my Reign game knows PTA. It's been a very, very interesting exercise.<br/><br/>First session, nobody gave anyone else an XP -- despite the fact I had left the requirement so wide open, and despite the fact it could be so easily gamed. I mentioned this over at Cultures of Play and someone suggested there was a stagefright/unfamiliarity element to it. That's probably true. I also feel there are some authority issues going on, even though the Table Daddy has handed down the mandate.<br/><br/>Second session, I had a guy give someone an XP, and that person immediately gave the other one an XP back. So they're learning, slowly. And the quid-pro-quo element was fairly predictable. To their credit, though, they each came up with a "that was really cool!" bit of verbal validation.<br/><br/>We're several sessions in and it's still very slow -- like, one or two people will participate and everyone else will just shrug. Despite the easy XP, the spoke-and-hub arrangement is so deeply ingrained that they continue to seem truly oblivious to each other's contribution to the game. I'm going to debrief after our next session and see if there's some element of resentment among the folks who aren't getting XPs, particularly if they're also not <i>giving</i> XPs.<br/><br/>For those who have participated, this little bit of mechanical inducement is very much working to open their eyes and ears to the fact that there are other people at the table.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156540/#Comment_156540" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-14T17:45:54+00:00" title="July 14, 2008  5:45PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><b>Levi:</b>How about this proposal: "Giving the players mechanical responsibility over something is a quick-and-dirty approach to giving them emotional investment in that thing, but not a complete replacement for it."

The more power he has, the more attention he <i>has </i>to pay? The more power he has, the less reason he has to listen, more like!<br/><br/>Or are we working under the idea that great responsiblity really does come with great power? Like, if you say "Here's some great power, please take it" and they consent to take it, then 'by default' they must have consented to taking on great responsiblity as well? Even though you didn't say anything about them also having to accept great responsiblity if they accepted the power?<br/><br/>I guess I'm questioning a fundimental there - like you've asked about retiling your roof and I've gone on to ask about the foundations of your house. So I'm kind of not answering the question, but tiling doesn't matter if your foundations collapse.<br/><br/>Edit: Oops, lazy reading on my part!

It's an exploration of personality (based on a premise I don't like much, actually, that being so reliant on the conceit of amnesia.)<br/><br/>My personal feelings aside, Penny for my Thoughts and, in the same boat, Universalis and several similar games that use not-so-very-set characters and a loose buy-changes-in-game-with-points-as-you-go-along system do have a nice means of getting players to pay attention to one another: money (well, points or chips or whatever it is you're spending to affect the story.)<br/><br/>But I think Paul B has a better idea (well, a more concise one) with the Fan Mail mechanics from Prime Time Adventures - encouraging players to encourage Eachother does seem to work out rather nicely. Problem is: GMs seem to freaking hate that idea.<br/><br/>For example, a few years ago this game called "X Crawl" came out. It had a "mojo pool" mechanic in it which worked a lot like fan mail. Players could spend points from their team's mojo pool to give one another bonuses to rolls and suchlike. It wasn't much, but it did provide players with a very neccessary... uh... let's call it a bonding mechanism (or maybe a bonding device? Bonding channel? I hate making up jargon, but I need the term.)<br/><br/>So I think that games which introduce some sort of... tactile... bonding... element... do rather alleiviate the need for the GM's dictatorial attention.<br/>Whether it boils down to XP or story points or free fudges or just a few extra GP in every horde, that sort of thing really helps.<br/>It just takes one person to trigger it (some people are very hands-on learners and need to see examples.)<br/><br/>But that still doesn't solve the problem of when does the turn start and when does the turn end.<br/><br/>Oh, and as for Callan S's post: Hear!

And circling back to the topic at hand, the GM as prime listener may be great at insuring that input is heard, and not as great at keeping people engaged, since the GM fulfills some of the functions they might otherwise be called upon to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157069/#Comment_157069" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T21:32:22+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  9:32PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Max:<br/><br/>The behavior is well known on my planet, yes...as <i>definitive bad-gamer behavior.</i> If someone can't be bothered to be engaged with the game, that tells us we've either chosen a boring game (and it won't get played again) or we're playing with a douche (and they won't get invited again).<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157071/#Comment_157071" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T21:34:36+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  9:34PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait.

Since they are constantly required to move the game forward, they are often most engaged and thus least bored.  Even while other players are bored, the GM will not be.  Another reason, it seems, that one might want to shift some of the listening role to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157095/#Comment_157095" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T03:58:09+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  3:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Word, Max.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157284/#Comment_157284" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T23:10:26+00:00" title="July 17, 2008 11:10PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, what I'm getting out of this thread;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a kick to be the GM. The story is always interesting for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of GMs, maybe not all, but certainly enough, turn the responsibility of GMing into an excuse to... what? Revel in god-like tyranny?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers tend to get bored in games when they have no stake in what's going on... or under a few other unnamed circumstances. (I'm starting a thread about that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a few new games on the market, well, relatively new games, anyway, are trying to address these issues. But some techniques are nearing the over-used mark (perhaps because they are so effective.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did I miss?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7030/gm-as-prime-listener" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7030/gm-as-prime-listener" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7030/gm-as-prime-listener/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7030%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7030%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
