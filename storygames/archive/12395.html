I think it is appropriate to ask this question in an rpg-forum, you'll see it for yourselves. (Excuse me for the wrong nomenclature, as I played the Hungarian versions of these games, so I have to translate back the specific names.)<br/><br/>First in Arkham Horror my character was travelling in an alien dimension (Yuggoth if I remember right) and had a whiskey. Then I drew a card which stated that everyone who has whiskey and don't succeed on a roll ends up in jail. I was wondering: how on Earth do the policemen get to Yuggoth to apprehend me? But I noticed that the card lacked the "in Arkham" condition, which is usual for cards like these. According to the game rules I should roll and see if I get back into the jail in Arkham from Yuggoth. I rolled for fun and succeeded the test easily, so it didn't become a problem.<br/><br/>Second yesterday (it was today, being after midnight) I was playing Battlestar Galactica, and one of the players (who were secretly a cylon, although we all knew that he was one) played a card which gave an action to another player on his turn - but this other player was a cylon, who already uncovered himself as a cylon and travelled around in the cylon locations. The card stated, that he can give that action to "any player", but the "coloring" of the card stated, that it's an executive order passed from a crewman to another crewman, and it would be really impossible for him to help the cylons organize their actions behind the enemy lines.<br/><br/>My problem is this: Much of the fun factor of these games originate from the theme and setting of the game, the color, the graphics and that the rules try to simulate/emulate/whateveryouwant the literal source which they are derived from. But being boardgames the players assume that they have to follow the rules verbatim and can't override them by pointing out irrealism or things like that. (I can't fly over the Battlestar Galactica, if the rules state that I have to fly around it.)<br/><br/>So my question is: How do you resolve these kind of dilemmas? How should it be resolved? Where is the point when I have to say that: the rules are worded inproperly and when should I say that this rule is more important than "realism" or "believability"? How much should we protect suspension of disbelief or how much should we assume that the verbatim rules are tested as balanced and more fun on the long run than changing them because of momentary dislikes? What's your opinion about this phenomenon?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278113/#Comment_278113" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-26T23:31:16+00:00" title="June 26, 2010 11:31PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Largely, I think these are merely oversights either in the basic rules themselves, or errors in translation.<br/>I can't speak specifically for the Battlestar Galactica game. However, I am pretty familiar with Arkham Horror. The event that you refer to, where characters with the whiskey have to roll or go to jail, I believe specifically requires the character to be in the streets of Arkham, and it doesn't apply if they are in another dimension. It is possible that there was a translation error.<br/><br/>I very rarely come across these conflicts between the story fiction and game rules, and in most cases, the creators release corrections or errata through their websites. More often, when I see these clashes, they are with the more mass-produced board games, rather than the more niche games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278139/#Comment_278139" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-27T10:07:48+00:00" title="June 27, 2010 10:07AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2010 10:08AM by jessecoombs.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This actually comes up a lot in Tales of Arabian Nights.

When the group could just as easily keep the mechanics the same and add a fun twist to the color to make it work. It ends up not only helping boost most people's sense of disbelief but also giving one side a mechanical advantage. <br/><br/>Unless it is a blatant mistake, we try to add a twist to the color (which setting wise makes us even more immersed) or let the person gain a new advantage to make up for the lost one. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Um...plenty of people do exactly this in an RPG.  "I can't critical hit that blob, just because they forgot to put in that this particular blob is immune to critical hits, every other blob in the world is immune. so this one should be too."</blockquote>\nThis is also a great opportunity to mention that if a designer does want to leave out or change something that most people would expect to be different... they should say why to lend credibility to the decision and minimize suspension of disbelief problems. There could be amazing story reasons for a blob being vulnerable to critical hits! This example is likely a mistake. But if it isn't... it's a missed opportunity on the designer's part!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278302/#Comment_278302" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T10:30:18+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 10:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2010 4:07AM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In theme-heavy ("ameritrash") games, I advocate for "fixing" the card/rule/event/whatever.

The problem I was addressing is rather the lack of time we have while playing. Noone will ever spend more time by looking up rules than it is necessary. For example when we played BSG, it was a rented game (so the guy who rented it didn't have much experience with it) and where we played we didn't have any Internet access.<br/><br/>So of course there are answers to these specific questions. The problem is that we don't know all the rules by heart and we didn't look up everything beforehand. And even the rulebooks don't help when we are in the middle of a game, because it would be too long break in the game and we rather play with a bad decision than to have a 5 minutes break in a fast paced session.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>In theme-heavy ("ameritrash") games, I advocate for "fixing" the card/rule/event/whatever.

I think I'd do the same.
