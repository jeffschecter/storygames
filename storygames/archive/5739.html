Some years ago I wrote on a site that spotlighted DC's Justice Society characters and their legacies. It was a pretty niche fanfic site but for those that geek about that stuff (i.e. me!) it was great. One of the stories that I wrote was an Elseworlds Tale about an Earth-2 Legion of Superheroes where they drew their inspiration from The Justice Society instead of the Justice League. That story was triple-niche-geek. About a slack handful of people 'got it' and they loved it. However, I was reviewed by one group of particular aggresive reviewers and the comments of the reviewer were thus;<br/>\n<br/>\n"I have only ever read one comic - Cerebus - and whilst technically this piece was well written I have to give it 1 out of 10 because I have no idea who any of these characters are, who they are meant to be drawn from and what these revelations are meant to reveal. Should I be thrilled that R.J.Brande (whoever he is) is actually someone called Vandal Savage in disguise? Rubbish."<br/>\n<br/>\nI replied back that as the title was on a niche fanfic site it really wasn't presented for the consumption of just anyone - there was some assumed knowledge involved in the process. She was not my target market. Her response?<br/>\n<br/>\n"Its been published on the internet. If I can read it, I can comment upon it and therefore I am your target market."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conversation sort of declined from there as I asked her whether she wrote critiques of engineering company technical manuals that are also posted online - hey, they're out there to be read and have zero exposition!!<br/>\n<br/>\n*deep breath*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this moment has stuck with me for some time and I have since then been aware of the limitations of niches. What I have also been aware of is a battle between the wisdom of making something accessible to all consistently and neutering something in order to do so to a point where it is dull and lifeless. When I did my first ever games design I had some quite animated discussions with my games group about the game being 'broken'. A number of system fixes were suggested and played with but in the end it boiled down to this. The problems with the system emerged when people were trying to break the system. If they played within the spirit of the game, the game played fine. If they tried to 'munchkin' the system, it fell apart. My attitude was very much 'hey, you've paid your money - if you want to fuck about with my game to the point of breaking it, fair play. I'll feel that pocket of change that used to be yours and is now mine and cry for your poor play experience. Its not like ... YOU DID IT TO YOUR SELF!' Essentially, it wasn't my place to hamper my design with limitations and one-way doors to stop people being asshats.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Don't worry, I'm getting there*<br/>\n<br/>\nTime moves on and I am deep in the second phase of playtesting of Duty &amp; Honour. D&amp;H; is a game about soldiers in the Napoleonic Wars, specifically the Peninsular Wars. It is, essentially, 'Sharpe  - The RPG'. Playtest results as a whole have been very positive and constructive and the game has changed a lot over the revisions to make it just better. I am very pleased. However one thing that has come back to me a couple of times are comments which I will paraphrase like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n"I don't know anything about the period or the situation and the game doesn't teach me enough to be able to enjoy that experience."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have diligently written a few short essays for the books with some thematic information about the period. I have written a one page 'situation' for the front ( you know '1810 and Europe is aflame!'). I have littered the text with flavour text and examples and explanations. I have done what I can. And yet the game is still a small press rpg about soldiers in the Peninsular War. We are back to that triple-niche-geek thing again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I will admit that there is a part of me that says 'WTF? What are you doing even CONSIDERING playing a game about a historical topic that you have no clue about? Thats lunacy. Whilst I love the look of 'Sons of Liberty' I have no idea about American History at all and wouldn't even consider buying it because of that. What makes my game different, you loons!!!'<br/>\n<br/>\n*into the final stretch*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I had two more comments which really brought things home. The first was from Caesar_X who said that if the game was about (I can't remember the exact military conflict) he would be able to relate better to the game. The second was from my truly awesome Aberdeen playtest group* who have started to hack the system to fit the English Civil War, which is one of their guys Geek Topic of Choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it struck me - a lot of our games flourish because they inhabit some quite tight and specialised niches. However, by the nature of niches, that limits their appeal and frustrates some people who have no knowledge of the niche.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thus my question is - If your game inhabits a niche, should you mechanically, through community support or via other means, support its 'hackability' so as to make it more readily available to more people? My kneejerk reaction is 'yes' but I would love to hear other views.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil<br/>\n<br/>\n* and when I say awesome, I mean that their playtest involved a 2500 word AP document and a 51-point dated issue log, graded by perceived severity of issue with documented workarounds and a 30 minute telephone debrief.

It's, through its process of play, very much a niche game. It's highly-narrative, it brings lots of narrative detail on the table, but it's also absolutely not about "Challenge" and sucks when you're looking for that. But what genre/setting/topic I use Wushu with doesn't matter. It could be The Matrix and it could be the Napoleonic Wars. It could be "gritty" and it could be "4 colour superhero". So in Wushu, I have a tool that's very focused on doing things in specific ways, focused on a specific procedure of play, but that's pretty agnostic with what kind of scenario I use it with and what genre or setting I feed into it.<br><br>Another example would be PtA: Again, a very specific type of gameplay, focused on doing things in a specific way, but what your series is about, whether it's Gilmore Girls or "Band of Brothers", doesn't matter to the system.<br><br>Games like these have, IMO, a feeling of inherent hackability, despite them being very focused on providing a very specific kind of experience. And I like that. So, well, no big advice or anything, just one point of data. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128369/#Comment_128369" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T04:27:52+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  4:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slightly off-topic answer ... since I am not answering the question till I've thought about it more <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>My feeling is that people expect games to tell them what they are about because the predominant experience is with games set in fantasy worlds that go with the game. If your game is set in the midst of the Elf / Purple Vampire war in the asteroid belt of a dying star then I need you to tell me *everything* about that setting (assuming the setting matters) because there is nowhere else to go to find it out. This isn't true about something based on a pre-existing fiction, or on real world events, because I can go and research it somewhere else.<br><br>But even if your game *is* based on something I can go and research elsewhere I still (personally) feel that you owe your readers a presentation of the setting, and that's because its not the facts of what happened that is the key to your game, but the spirit, and how I read the spirit from my research is not the same as how you might. <br><br>So for Duty and Honor, for example, I can go and read about the period, and the Peninsular war and so on, but that won't tell me your take on it. Am I playing a game about the unremitting horror of mass war and the callousness of the people behind it, or am I playing a swashbuckling game of cannons, stolen gold and beautiful spanish women? It's not so much the facts I need from you as the interpretation, the feel, the spirit of things.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128396/#Comment_128396" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T06:32:24+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Flexible games are better than inflexible games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128424/#Comment_128424" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T07:14:03+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  7:14AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The first was from Caesar_X who said that if the game was about (I can't remember the exact military conflict) he would be able to relate better to the game.

My game <b>Ganakagok</b> is very specific in its setting--the characters are quasi-Inuit tribespeople who live in a dark ice-world where the Sun will soon rise for the first time in human memory--and so I think it fits your definition of a 'niche-filling' game. It may even be sui generis. And while lots of people who've played it have said they see how it could be ported over to other settings (Rob Donoghue suggested it could work for an Amber throne war game; my friend Shawn de Arment thought about hacking it for a God-Emperor of Dune scenario) the work required would be extensive, because you'd have to make a whole new deck of cards to serve as the oracle for the game.<br><br>A little background: the Ganakagok deck has four suits of 13 cards each, just like a regular deck of playing cards, but the suits are Tears, Flames, Storms, and Stars (each corresponding to a particular category of spirit in the game-world as well as having other correspondences) and the high cards are Child, Woman, Man, and Ancient. Each card has a name (e.g., the Ancient of Tears), an image (e.g., Polar Bear), and a motif (e.g., "to overcome or master") that can be drawn upon in play for a variety of narrative purposes.<br><br>So, to a great degree, the setting is built into the deck by virtue of the images and motifs that it contains, and the effect is to produce mythical-feeling stories as the by-product of play. The thing is, even slight changes in tone are difficult to manage: Don Corcoran has run an over-the-top wu shu "Crouching Polar Bear, Hidden Orca" Ganakagok game where fighters with crystal swords jump into the air to slice the wires holding the star-knights in the sky and send them to their doom. The main difficulty, he told me, is that the images on the Ganakagok cards made it hard to sustain the over-the-top action, because they grounded the action in the more humble setting of villagers in their mundane world.<br><br>So hacking <b>Ganakagok</b> requires rebuilding the deck, every time.<br><br>But I suppose that it may not be as daunting a task as I imagine. The willingness of folks to craft new <i>In a Wicked Age</i> oracles is instructive. In the case of Ganakagok card-hacks, the oracle needs to be fairly comprehensive, but I loosely based the meanings of the deck on the corresponding tarot card, so a generalized set of procedures might be all that's necessary for people who wanted to "hack" the game. I wonder what those procedures would be, though.<br><br>My own favorite idea is to make a <b>Ganakagok</b> variant called <b>Ragnarok</b>, where the characters were vikings in a world where the countdown to the end of the world had begun, and the players' actions would determine whether a new world would rise from the ashes of the old. But, again, it would require "translating" the deck into a Norse idiom.<br><br>But the difficulty of translating the game-rules and the game-deck into other settings is part-and-parcel of what makes <b>Ganakagok</b> itself so compelling as a game: it's tightly crafted to do the one thing it's intended to do very well. So the trade-off for the loss of flexibility is a game that's very, very good at the one thing it does.  And that may be worth it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128461/#Comment_128461" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T08:02:45+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  8:02AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 8:03AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you gotta make the game you gotta make. Understanding that a game that's very specific will tend to have a very limited audience. People who want to be your audience, but aren't, shouldn't really change your mind about the scope of the game, unless you really want to open the scope up. <br>\n<br>\nThat said, there's something almost like the concept of "timelessness" that pertains. That is, it's quite possible to have stuff that seems very specific, but which resonates more than we feel. That is, is your game about the specifics of the Napoleonic Wars? Or is it, in fact, about something more timeless that's evoked by that particular conflict? <br>\n<br>\nGanakagok is not about Inuits. You don't have to know squat about Inuits to appreciate the game. Nor are the results of the oracles of the game actually Inuit specific. The themes that are evoked by Ganakagok are ones of social mores and values, change, and things coming to an end. These things are absolutely timeless and universal to all people. Oh, it might not be what everyone wants to play about today, sure, but it's stuff that anyone can relate to. The "setting" of Ganakagok simply exists to highlight these themes. <br>\n<br>\nSo... if you can find something timeless that the conflict in question brings out, and your game focuses on it, then it will become inherently hackable to any situation that is similar. Moreover, like Ganakagok, people won't complain about its seeming specificity, because it will, in fact, speak to them. <br>\n<br/>\nFor instance, if you focus on the Napoleonic War's social orders and rank systems and getting promoted... that'll probably remain pretty specific to that conflict, and only interest players who are into that era. The game Carry, on the other hand, is only about Vietnam in that it's about soldiers and their relationships to each other in the dire circumstances of a protracted war. Vietnam is a perfect setting for this, but I'll bet folks could get a lot of milage out of hacking it to the current situaiton in Iraq, for instance. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is your game about? Is it in fact about educating the players to the specific reality of the Napoleonic Wars? Or is it about... honor? Duty? Soldierly prerogatives and limits? <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you say your game is about? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128476/#Comment_128476" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T08:26:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  8:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 8:28AM by Neil Gow.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\n- its about ordinary men doing extraordinary things in a land far from home<br/>\n- its about the contrasts between the lives of the officers and the lives of the rank and file<br/>\n- its about soldiers and emulating the 'small cast adventures' of books like Sharpe and Hornblower<br/>\n- its about the social games of reputation that were so paramount at the time<br/>\n- its about everyone wrapping those things together to tell a gripping adventure story<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about it like that sort of answers my question too.

Post or email if you need help drifting it a bit to another setting or genre. (DitV is famous for this.)<br>3) Born to build - Here's a system built with no setting or genre in mind; here's a laundry list of settings using the system, or roll your own. (Hero and my own GLASS.)<br><br>So "should you" do 1, 2, or 3? Yes, no, maybe. How much time have you got to provide post-sales support? Do you intend to provide supplements? Are you attempting to serve other functional or business goals (ex: I want GLASS to gain a following mainly so I can con-play boffer without spending three hours reading rules every one-shot)?<br><br>As a data point: I and others have tried to get Vincent to make a "Generic Dogs System" or to revise DitV with an explicit new chapter that says "Here's How To Make A Different Setting" and goes over all the stuff to re-skin. May or may not happen (most likely latter). But he--and other fans--are around to help folks re-skin DitV; and we even managed to build a "short list" of the stuff to re-skin (an outline, if you will, of the aforementioned new chapter). So, there: even when Vincent was basically at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, he does some <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, and fans have more-or-less created a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> supplement.<br><br>And that final point provides another data point: as a designer, you probably don't have any control or say in the matter! Yes, a game can be easier or harder to re-skin (new setting or genre) or hack (replacement or additional systems), and as a designer, you can expose (or not) the inner workings to skinners/hackers. But the final choice is ever with the consumers, and they outnumber you....                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131183/#Comment_131183" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T09:19:31+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  9:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil, I think one of the big factors in this decision (the decision being whether or not to explicate the setting) is your publishing goal.<br><br>Is this game going to be posted up for free on the internet?  Then yeah, let its nicheness thrive and let people do their own research (and/or, it being the internet, provide links).<br><br>Will the game be printed up and offered to others as a product?  Then you need to ask yourself if you're providing your customers with fair value for the money they give you.  Are you including in the book, and therefore providing for the money they are handing you, information to properly contextualize them so the game will be enjoyable for anybody?  Alternately, does any potential customer <em>know</em>, based on your back cover blurb or whatever, that your game is super-nichey and may not be their cup of tea?<br><br/>Or look at it from a different angle: what you want to do with the game -- do you just want to share a game that you enjoy with other people who like that genre/setting/whatever?  Then screw the explication, and make sure that only your fellow-enthusiasts buy it.  Or do you want a game that lots of people play?  Then you have your work cut out for you making it accessible to as many people as possible.  Or (yes, there's a third option, and a fourth and a fifth, and so on forever) do you want the game to be an evangelistic effort spreading the enjoyment and appreciation of that genre/setting/whatever to people who've never heard of it before (cf: Sorcerer and Sword)?<br/><br/>What's your goal, Neil, beyond "making a game?"  Answer that, and everything else should become a lot clearer.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132191/#Comment_132191" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T17:21:41+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  5:21PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At risk of being too geeky and off-topic for this thread and site...<br/><br/>...where can I read your Earth-2 Legion story? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
