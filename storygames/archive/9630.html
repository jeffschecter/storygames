What little elements of life inspire ideas, and then what mutations those ideas go through before they can be used.<br/><br/>So, last night I was thinking about using visuals to inspire an entire setting. I'm sure most of you have done this: you dream up one really cool image, either a place, a character, or an event, and then you build an entire setting -- and sometimes a narrative or game or both -- to create a place for that image to fit. And sometimes by the time you're done, the image has changed slightly, but hopefully for the better.<br/><br/>Here's what I've been looking at: in a lot of video games lately, characters have cool dangly props -- <a href="http://prince-of-persia.us.ubi.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">scarves</a>, <a href="http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2009/01/30/the-complex-cape-physics-of-batman-arkham-asylum/" rel="nofollow">capes</a>, <a href="http://www.heavenlysword.com/" rel="nofollow">long hair</a> -- that move in interesting ways as the character navigates the environment. This is partly to show off the games' physics, but also it adds a sense of motion an movement, even when the character is static. Similarly, the "dungeonpunk" design aesthetic that many modern fantasy RPG artists have embraced involves lots of little hanging bits, be they amulets, scroll tubes, scarves (again) or other animated accessories. <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?q=wayne+reynolds&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=7no-SurjFYyQsgOL75W7Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=title" rel="nofollow">Wayne Reynolds</a> and <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;um=1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=steve+prescott&amp;btnG=Search+images&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=" rel="nofollow">Steve Prescott</a> spring particularly to my mind.<br/><br/>So, I started thinking "wouldn't it be cool if in my setting, everyone had lots of cool flowing layers and carried little gadgets and scroll tubes on their belts? What could a setting have that would cause that?"<br/><br/>What I came up with was a world where some particularly aggressive tree similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratea_exorrhiza" rel="nofollow">walking palm</a> has overrun the world. The trees, possibly with malicious intent, are constantly shifting and crawling across the land, making any large-scale cultivation or civilization basically impossible. Instead, you have city-states that are walled off and protected from the trees, and adventurers that move between them. The adventurers all possess copies of a magical map that shows the  few safe points in the world; the maps are artifacts of some past time, so they are a limited commodity. Since they need the maps at a moments notice, and must always carry them, they all have cool scroll tubes on their belts.<br/><br/>To make the setting one notch more hostile, I decided that the weather was also incredibly unpredictable, so you have storms and sudden temperature swings throughout. As anyone who does a lot of outdoor activities will tell you, layering is essential to keep dry and adjust to temperature, so all the heroes also wear multiple capes, cloaks, wraps, and the like. As an added benefit, the layers can be used to break the outline of the human form, and thus add to natural camouflage.<br/><br/>Further refinements to the idea were that the trees, the storms, and other elements of the hostile environment are all gods or spirits in an animistic sense, and are actively hostile to humans for any number of reasons. Humans have found safety by using the bodies of dead gods to build their cities on: major hills and rises, and sometimes lakes, are all remnants of other gods that have died. The maps that the heroes carry, I figured, show the relative distance between different dead gods, and the hostile gods don't mess with the dead gods out of either respect or fear. The gods thing also mean that the characters might carry amulets and charms which may be able to drive away hostile forces.<br/><br/>So, I have no game (if it's a game), I have no story (if it's a narrative form), but I have a setting that serves my visual desire of characters who wear layers of dangly bits.<br/><br/>Anyone else have a similar example to share?<br/><br/><i>Edit: fixed a link</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213761/#Comment_213761" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T16:15:52+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  4:15PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite><br/>Anyone else have a similar example to share?</blockquote>\nNot right now, but in the last week my friend at work turned me on to Manga-esque art books. I've gotten a couple for video games, but there's whole gorgeous books in a very buyable price range just filled with ideas. In fact, I might turn this into a new thread, but here:<br/><br/><a href="http://parkablogs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://parkablogs.com/</a><br/><br/>A blog about the latest art books, by a Singaporean book owner. This is some deeply inspiring shit.<br/><br/>I say not right now because I haven't done it a lot in the past (except when I played Morrowind a lot, and started bringing in descriptions of Morrowind-style architecture into my fantasy game), but I sure as hell will in the future.<br/><br/>After seeing Exodyssey (<a href="http://parkablogs.com/content/book-review-exodyssey-visual-development-of-epic-adventure-steambot-studios" rel="nofollow">http://parkablogs.com/content/book-review-exodyssey-visual-development-of-epic-adventure-steambot-studios</a>), I immediately put it in my Wish List on Amazon. It will form the basis of my next SF game.<br/><br/>This shit is unreal: It's a visual setting guide that you can use to basically lift bits out and throw into your game.<br/><br/>When he showed me his copy of the Okami Art Book, I simply blacked out, next thing I know I was looking at my Amazon screen with the "thank you for your purchase" notification in front of me. That book has tons and tons and tons of inspiring art, with little elements so ready and ripe to be pulled out and used in tabletop games.<br/><br/>So yeah, I don't have any advice of my own, but I do have a place where, "If you want to do it, MORE, here's a starter link to the best place on the internet to find out about new and upcoming sourcebooks (art books) to do so".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213762/#Comment_213762" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T16:29:53+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  4:29PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D'ya think steampunk's affection for goggles comes from the need to protect your eyes when you're surrounded by belching steam engines? Hm!<br/><br/>For me, I really dug the early Bionicle toys with their Polynesian sounding names and humanoid robot motifs. This was before Lego released any movies or comics or anything, so you're left with just these mute skinny robots with swords, spears and odd alignments with the elements. Everything else was your imagination.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/le/lego-bionicle-brutaka.jpg"/><br/><br/>I also really liked the crazy animals that appeared in a Discovery Channel special called "The Future is Wild." In that special, they theorized what kind of animals would evolve in the habitats that would arise thousands and millions of years from now. They had flying fish and giant walking squids, it was cool stuff.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.thefutureiswild.com/img/feature-banner/Forest-flish.png"/><br/><br/>Both of these things made me create a game called <b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070210121051/www.luchacabra.com/?p=46" rel="nofollow">Gears &amp; Spears</a>: Mythic Tribal Robot Fantasy in the Year 200,000,000AD</b>. It wasn't a very good game, mind you, but it had some fun ideas. Basically, robots in the far distant, post-human future are in hunter-gatherer tribes and you tell the story of the heroes from those tribes, who will eventually become the myths and legends of future generations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213764/#Comment_213764" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-21T17:06:02+00:00" title="June 21, 2009  5:06PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Possibly the biggest inspiration for <em>The Fifth World</em> came from Michael Green's <em>Afterculture</em>.

I'd bet we share tastes in this matter.</p>\n<p>Adam, here's a thing to consider: what does your setting require? If it's hot, look at cultures that live in hot places. Is it on mountains? Look at cultures that live in the mountains. Are they literate? Look at cultures that are literate.</p>\n<p>I find the "spiky armor" phenomenon to be deeply irritating. They're artifacts without a culture to support them. In real life, armor wasn't covered with spikes, and that's not because they somehow <a href="http://grendelscave.net/armory/i/diarm3528/diarm3528-01.jpg" rel="nofollow">never thought of it</a>. It's because it didn't make sense to get super-spiky. It's heavy, it catches on stuff. Spiked armor is more a sign of dilettantism that badassery in my eyes.</p>\n<p>I'd be a lot more scared of this guy...<br/>\n<img alt="Viking" src="http://www.doyle.com.au/images/viking_waxe.jpg"/></p>\n<p>... than this guy, who looks like he got his armor at Hot Topic:<br/>\n<img alt="Hot Topic" src="http://pcmedia.gamespy.com/pc/image/article/747/747222/iwarhammer-age-of-reckoningi-the-hordes-of-chaos-20061121045650831.jpg"/></p>\n<p>... and that's because the first guy has stuff that looks like it means business. He's not wearing armor to show off, and the stuff that <em>is</em> there to show off carefully doesn't get in the way of the things he really needs. He lives in a cold place (wearing wool and fur), comes from a tradition of craft (sleek metalwork), likes to be recognized in battle (one dangly bit holding on his cape, plus the bright, geometric colors on his shield). His name is probably Alfred or something.</p>\n<p>The second guy, who I'm naming Bulgor the Eye-Groin, looks like he was designed by his publicist. He doesn't have a way to put away his sword. His spikes look terrifying but are going to get in his own way and that of his allies. (Never mind the weird anatomy the guy must have. Does he have double shoulders or something?) His horns are probably mostly for being grabbed by the guys he's fighting. In order to show off his pirate boots, his shins are unarmored.</p>\n<p>So, start off bottom up. Figure out how the place has evolved, or why it's been created, or whatever. Build things from the ground up. If you start with the window dressing, you'll forget to keep out the rain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213856/#Comment_213856" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T08:29:10+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  8:29AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No example to share, but <a href="http://armorcast.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=347" rel="nofollow">I'd love to make something up inspired by this piece</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213883/#Comment_213883" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T10:32:31+00:00" title="June 22, 2009 10:32AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not big on spikes and fantastical armour, either. I look at pictures like the Eye-Groin up there and wonder how he gets his arms up high enough to swing that sword, and then were he keeps it when he's not posing. In fact, I specify "animated accessories" for a reason. Rigid, heavy, impractical lumps like that don't speak to the visual aesthetic I have in mind at all. When I mention Reynolds, I definitely mean more like <a href="http://paizo.com/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/PathfinderDesktop-5.jpg" rel="nofollow">this guy</a> than <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/cd_gallery/81351.jpg" rel="nofollow">this mess</a>. <a href="http://paizo.com/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/PathfinderDesktop-Rogue.jpg" rel="nofollow">this rogue</a> is a borderline case. The right direction, but she probably wouldn't survive my setting if the weather changed. And those shoulder things are lame.<br/><br/>I'm big on scarves, cloaks, baubles, and other assorted danglies. In fact, my heroes as envisioned wouldn't wear armour at all, because they are primarily travellers and explorers, and chances are anything that might try to kill them is scary enough that escaping it is much more viable than fighting it. If they have extra protection, it's more like climbing gear than war-harness. Ankle-and-wrist, knee-and-shin. Maybe some light torso protection. Like modern special forces, with a fantasy design, and capes and hoods and magical amulets to keep the moss-spirits away in the night.<br/><br/><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_81lhhr8VvM4/Sf1Lv4i8AjI/AAAAAAAAANM/7r8aFDXlukE/s1600-h/SAD067.jpg" rel="nofollow">Hino</a> can live in my setting, and so can <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_81lhhr8VvM4/SeLlCtr4B7I/AAAAAAAAAMU/jsFxGFdXJn0/s1600-h/SAD060.jpg" rel="nofollow">Anubis</a>, <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2086/2062687142_3ad2cbdd93.jpg" rel="nofollow">Altair</a>, and perhaps some version of <a href="http://groovyvic.mu.nu/archives/images/690~Pirates-Of-The-Caribbean-Captain-Jack-Sparrow-Posters.jpg" rel="nofollow">Captain Jack Sparrow</a>.<br/><br/>The real-world culture this is definitely an issue.

OK, so maybe that's not the best example.<br/><br/>Like, OK, having just read Shock 1.1 (so cool, btw), it would be like taking the illustration on page 43 and nothing else, and deciding what was going on in the entire setting that made that picture make sense. For an extra twist, include misperceptions, like my belief, upon first viewing, that the reflection showed a much dirtier, more-run-down, and lower-tech version of the scene than the actual vista.<br/><br/>I think we all do this, to some extent. Actually, I know we do, every time we watch a movie where we are presented with a slice of the world, we subconsciously fill in the gaps. Sometimes we even have debates about how the rules of the world work. Take <i>Star Wars</i>, for example. There may be a canonical reason how their FTL works, but I have no idea what it is. So -- at least implicitly --  I extrapolate the function of the SW hyperdrives based on what we see on the screen, and I extrapolate an inventor (or multiple inventors) of FTL technology, and patent struggles, and government interventions, and all that background stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Windows are open. The people living at the base of the space elevator are very poor and make their houses out of some sort of adobe-like polymer. Originally, they were all the same, but they've been repaired and modified over time. The windows have these little peaks to keep rain dripping around, rather than into, windows. The roofs are actually domed to let the water run off, but the frame of the building is a cube because that's an easy building module, so they've cut holes in the corners to let the water run out, neither of which were in the original design. There are also abundant gutters in the streetsand they build little Japanese-style foot bridges over them to get into their houses.</p>\n<p>We'd also started with the idea that the people living there were North African Arabs who'd left in some sort of economic migration. From that came the Arabic symbolism \u2014 the chamsah, the fact that there's a casbah at all, and the two guys drinking tea conspiratorially. It was supposed to be like Algiers, but a wet company town instead of a colonial puppet.</p>\n<p>So, that's about how I do it at my house.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213941/#Comment_213941" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T15:10:23+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  3:10PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I arrive at the picture with just the picture and none of your story. I see a North African-style city with a big shiny high-tech tower in the distance. I see a road, slick and shiny, but in the reflection, the tower looks like a mountain. One of the antennae isn't reflected. The buildings too are less-square, more run-down, as if they were built by less-skilled hands, or out of shoddier materials.<br/><br/>Now my job is to figure out what kind of world makes that possible. Is it a matter of reality/illusion? If so, which is reality? Is it a matter of two parallel cities, somehow meeting at the point of the Silver Road? Is it a representation of the inevitability of some symbols, showing that these people, in this place, will always build that Tower, no matter how many times it is torn down?<br/><br/>I guess I'm getting at some kind of inversion of what you have here. Actually, a LOT like that contest that was up a few weeks back, now that I think about it, with the cropped Victoriana-style image of the airship with the female pilot, except starting from a bit more of a generality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213950/#Comment_213950" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T16:11:38+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  4:11PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>this is like the best thread that's been on here in weeks. thanks, Adam.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213956/#Comment_213956" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T17:31:20+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  5:31PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love it when two nerdrages battle:<br/><br/>OMG Eye-Groin will slayz you with his spiky hotness!

LAAAAME) and was pretty jazzed by it. My cards have writing on the back, though, so I guess they backed off from that. EW has a setting, of course, but I suppose the whole point of moving from world to world in that game is that the setting can change from game-to-game, which is exactly right. So if you see this woman standing on top of a labyrinth poking a tiger with a stick, then it's a lot of fun trying to figure out what kind of crazy world that takes place in.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I guess that's a good way to work if you are looking at "intelligent back-formations" too. You can say "OK, Picture 1 of the real world has X, Y, Z and Picture 2 has A, B, C, and  I want my fantasy world to have X, Y, and B. How can I have X and Y in the absence of Z? B and X never appear together in the real world, so why are they together here?"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I hadn't really given the Shinto angle much thought, to be honest, but it's a good one. I tend to take my animism from North American sources.

Once upon a time, Frank Frazetta painted the <a>Death Dealer</a>. It was subsequently airbrushed onto a shitload of vans, but eventually appeared in a series of novels (which were not terrible when I was 13) and a comic book. So kudos to James Silke (the writer of the novels) for taking this creepy-ass painting and explaining everything in it: the helmet, the axe, the piles of bodies; and also tying in all sorts of other Frazetta mainstays: jungle queens with giant cats, huge battle scenes, oversized snakes, and tons of naked ladies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214174/#Comment_214174" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T09:08:49+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  9:08AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eye-groin reminded me of this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc218/cypsiman2/44-1.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214179/#Comment_214179" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T09:51:24+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  9:51AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things I would like to use some day:\n<ul><li><a href="http://moneyart.biz/dd/" rel="nofollow">Antarctican Dream Dollars</a></li><li><a href="http://store.cgsociety.org/product/000348/" rel="nofollow">Entropia: A Collection of Unusually Rare Stamps</a></li></ul>\nAlso, right now I'm working on a game that's coming almost entirely from the tail end of a dream that I remember (which is rare for me). Everything in the game is made from things that were thrown away in our world. I'm using a version of the ORE similar to the one in Monsters, but of course I'll have to talk to some people if I ever want to release the game. I have very little artistic skill, so it's really tough to implement it - the closest stuff I have looks like a three-year-old drew something in crayon, and then his six-year-old sister scanned it into MS Paint to "improve" it. Here's a page mockup with two of the major antagonists:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.valentgames.com/unrelated/Thrown-Away-Layout.jpg"/><br/><br/>Sigh. I wish I had artistic skill (or the time to develop it). It would make finishing a game so much easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214187/#Comment_214187" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T10:10:19+00:00" title="June 24, 2009 10:10AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin; FWIW I kinda dig the art.
