Excluding anything but physical conflict from the examples. <br/><br/>These don't seem to mesh well. When would a character roll dice that is not a physical fight. All the example point away from this possibility. <br/><br/>Can a character "force" another character to do something through honor or civil law or what?  Would this allow social conflict?  <br/><br/>Maybe it's just me but I thought I knew the game until I reread it today. Please help. <br/><br/>B-(                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140477/#Comment_140477" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-19T11:14:25+00:00" title="April 19, 2008 11:14AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't have to be a question of force, sometimes it's trick, or convince, or cajole.<br/><br/>It's easier to goive some examples.<br/><br/>A wanton wife tries to seduce her husband into the demonic cabal she's joined.

That's conversation, that's talking, that's "pure roleplaying", there's not dice on that, also as a Player you have final say on what your PC's mind thinks about something (though you are heavily motivated to compromise as shown in your actions etc. when negotiated).<br/><br/>There is "force someone".  As long as your fiction/your table agrees "yup, that's force" then the mechanism used is fine.  You force them to give it over by winning the argument in court (assuming they didn't then decide to keep it and become an outlaw), you force them to stop pursuing the princess's hand by tripping them, mocking them and making them look a fool (assuming they didn't want to be the fool pursuing princess), you use such an abusive, harsh, horrible argument or such a seductive, sexy, make-yourself-wanton move (Sahu Sheen in the text) that you don't care they agree because they're crying, torn up, disgraced or you don't care they give in to seduction against their "better self, social mores etc" and will hate themselves the next day, and your table agrees these are forms of force then you can dice for them.<br/><br/>Note, however that the dice tell you who wins.  It's still for players (including GM) to decide what happens.  Most "force" does actually leave a choice if sometimes an unattractive one.  I point a gun at your head and say give me your money, you have a choice.  You don't, I still have a choice too.  This is where negotiation etc. comes in.  I win my seductive dice as the lusty spirit, the PC can still say "I take damage, I don't negotiate what you want happening in the fiction", and narration proceeds to incorporate that (the seducer as winner describes what the exhaustion is like, and perhaps the lusty spirit goes on to another conflict and wins again, ultimately just how important is it to the player not to give in to the seduction, important enough to be knocked out of chapter, to die?  Cool, we have learned something about that character).<br/><br/>PS - re above, I agree that lies and deception can be seen as force.  They deny true choice, don't care about what the subject really wants or thinks.<br/><br/>Rob (not a guru, just a follower)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140490/#Comment_140490" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-19T13:28:02+00:00" title="April 19, 2008  1:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the thing you're doing can possibly exhaust or injure someone, you can go to dice over it.<br/><br/>The standard of "can possibly" is local to your group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
