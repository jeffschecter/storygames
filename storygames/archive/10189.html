It's technically a stand-alone game, but it works well as a way to continue the stories of your favorite characters from games of <i>carry</i> or <i>Black Cadillacs.</i><br/><br/>I've got the <a href="http://twoscooterspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/homecoming.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF,</a> and also some physical copies from GenCon I'd be happy to mail out for a couple bucks in shipping. The physical copies are "Free to good homes," meaning I've only got a few, so if you get one and decide it's not your deal, I'd really appreciate it if you'd pass it along to someone who might enjoy it more.<br/><br/>On a personal note, my nephew was the only medical health specialist in the US Army deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan for upwards of 18 months, so this project is very near and dear to my heart. As such I'm really hungry for feedback and open to suggestions on how to make the game better. If you play it, let me know! I'd consider it a personal favor.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226401/#Comment_226401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T22:07:46+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 10:07PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth,<br/><br/>I picked up a copy at GenCon, and I am looking forward to giving it the college try.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226406/#Comment_226406" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T23:33:42+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 11:33PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, the game looks really interesting! But I cannot for the life of me understand how it's to be played. It's confusing as hell to me.<br/><br/>The Scar and Civilian give dice to the soldier when they insert things in the narrative. Check. The scar does so when she "inserts a piece of narrative that forces the Soldier to deal with the loss of his trait". This confused me at first, since the word "trait" has a specific meaning in most RPGs, but I realized later that it means the thing the soldier lost. Right? Confused me.<br/><br/>"During each scene, both the Scar and the Civilian have chances to tempt the Soldier into taking more dice." How does this work? This is the only mention of this temptation I can find. What do they do to tempt him?<br/><br/>"If the Soldier chooses to roll the red dice he\u2019s been given ..." So, apparently the Soldier is supposed to choose which dice to roll. All dice of one color he's been given in the scene? When does he do this. At the end of the scene, or what?<br/><br/>"Whichever dice the Soldier chooses to keep are dice the soldier can spend moving around the gameboard". Are these the dice he rolled, or the dice he didn't roll? Does he move as many moves as the sum of the roll, the number of dice not rolled, or what? And what happens to the dice he rolled? Or the dice he didn't roll?<br/><br/>"Joe has 4 red dice and 6 blue dice, and crosses the negative Civilian line" What is the negative Civilian line? I thought you moved in the squares and circles! Then you don't cross any lines.<br/><br/>"Joe is eight spaces away from a Soldier scene." What? To me it looks like you can cross the entire board in six moves. How can you be eight spaces away?<br/><br/>"Soldier can also spend his dice to move through already-colored spaces to get to a Soldier scene." How does that work?<br/><br/>The second page clears up movement a bit and answers some questions (which suggests you might want to restructure the text), but I'm still left without enough info to actually sit down and play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226408/#Comment_226408" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T23:43:39+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 11:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been looking forward to checking this out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226459/#Comment_226459" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T06:24:32+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  6:24AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where on the board does the Soldier start?

Thanks for saying that, it's one of the reasons I wanted it in front of fresh eyes. The text made sense to the people I'd shown it to, but then, they already knew how the game worked. Good to know about the restructuring of the text-- one of the reasons I wanted to get this in front of people is that I don't know what in the rules needs expanding to make sense, so this is already really helpful.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite>The Scar and Civilian give dice to the soldier when they insert things in the narrative.

This confused me at first, since the word "trait" has a specific meaning in most RPGs, but I realized later that it means the thing the soldier lost. Right? Confused me.</blockquote>\nRight. The word "trait" in this simply means one of the three character traits you decide at the beginning of the game-- something he admires about himself, something his unit admires about him, and something a very important loved one admires about him. If trait is a confusing word for that, what's a better one?<br>\n<blockquote><cite>"During each scene, both the Scar and the Civilian have chances to tempt the Soldier into taking more dice." How does this work? This is the only mention of this temptation I can find. What do they do to tempt him?</cite></blockquote>\nThis definitely needed more expansion, then. It's repetition of what you quoted above; when the Scar inserts something Scar-related into a scene, if the Soldier lets it throw him, then he takes the die that goes with it. If a Civilian inserts something which pulls him closer to a civillian life into a scene, if the Soldier lets it affect him, he takes the die.<br><br>Examples: It's a Civilian scene on the positive end, so the Civilian's player is framing a scene which deals with the Soldier's return to civilian life in a positive way. The Soldier was in the reserves, so he's returning to his old job. They're throwing a surprise party for him.<br>Civilian: "Your boss is making a big embarassing speech about how great it is to have you back, and the cute receptionist you had a crush on keeps eyeing you." <br>The Soldier can either take the die and go with the flow-- say something like "I wink at her and laugh at my boss"-- or refuse the die and show that it had no affect on him-- "I just stare at my shoes."<br><br>It's the Scar's turn, then. "While you're talking to the receptionist, a balloon pops." The Soldier can either take the die and go with the flow-- "I flinch and almost duck"-- or refuse the die and show that it had no affect on him-- "I blink and force a smile." etc.<br>\n<blockquote><cite>If the Soldier chooses to roll the red dice he\u2019s been given ..." So, apparently the Soldier is supposed to choose which dice to roll. All dice of one color he's been given in the scene? When does he do this. At the end of the scene, or what?</cite></blockquote>\nI think this is what you were talking about when you said the second page cleared stuff up, right? At the end of the scene the Soldier chooses to roll one color of dice. He keeps any dice he was given that were of the other color.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>"Joe has 4 red dice and 6 blue dice, and crosses the negative Civilian line" What is the negative Civilian line? I thought you moved in the squares and circles! Then you don't cross any lines.</cite></blockquote>\nIf you look at the game board, it exists on an axis. There are two lines making a big X. You can only move between spaces using the lines, ie, if there isn't a line connecting two spaces, you can't go there. The corners of the big lines that each bisect the board say Civilian, Scar, Even, Odd. The text SHOULD say, if you land on a space which is on one of these lines, or move across a space on one of these lines.\n<blockquote><cite>"Joe is eight spaces away from a Soldier scene." What? To me it looks like you can cross the entire board in six moves. How can you be eight spaces away?</cite></blockquote>\nSee what I'm about to say below.\n<blockquote><cite>"Soldier can also spend his dice to move through already-colored spaces to get to a Soldier scene." How does that work?</cite></blockquote>\nIf the Soldier wants to do one or more of the following:\n<ul><li>Get to a specific quadrant of the board</li>\n<li>Burn off dice he's holding</li>\n<li> Cross one of the lines in order to to deposit the dice he has<br/></li><li>Get to a Soldier scene from elsewhere on the board</li></ul>\nHe can travel through already-used spaces to get to a blank one. It costs one die of the appropriate color to move through any colored square.<br/><br/><br/>Does that help?

I'm going to push out a clearer version of all of this today.<br/>\n<blockquote>I see 3 square spaces on the board, plus 1 in each corner.
