Since people had fun at the Story Game Lounge at <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5693" rel="nofollow">ConQuest NW</a> this year, not to mention at Go Play NW, we're doing it again at <a href="http://www.dragonflight.org/" rel="nofollow">Dragonflight, August 8-10</a>.  It will work on the same principle: people show up with their games in one of the two conference rooms set aside for RPGs, advertise them on the white board, recruit players, and go.  Unlike at last ConQuest, it will be located right near the other RPGs.  <br/><br/>In order to have it show in the schedule, we had to schedule it as an event, which means having a host or "GM".  Right now, it's scheduled under one name (Laura Mortensen, the organizer) as a continuous event throughout the weekend.  However, it would be much better if various people took over hosting different segments.  Incidentally, people who sign up to run register 6 time blocks' worth of events (15 hours) in time for the final convention program, i.e., by July 26, get their convention fee refunded.  It doesn't have to be just Story Game Lounge hours, they can have a combination of any types of events.  <br/><br/>Speaking of registration, it's $40 to register for the entire convention until July 31, and $50 at the door.  Check the <a href="=http://www.dragonflight.org/index.php?page=9" rel="nofollow">Dragonflight Website</a> for single-day rates.  <br/><br/>So, do I see any brave volunteers stepping forward to host for a few hours and even maybe enough to get the admission fee reimbursed?  And do I hear any suggestions for how to make this a kick-ass event?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154921/#Comment_154921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-04T21:36:54+00:00" title="July  4, 2008  9:36PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would totally do this if I weren't a thousand miles away at Worldcon in Denver.

The piggy-backing approach works well to get a mini-con at relatively low overhead and effort.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155558/#Comment_155558" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T22:21:43+00:00" title="July  8, 2008 10:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hola, people, listen up!  Everybody said the ConQuest NW Story Game Lounge was a lot of fun, and GoPlay NW was fantastic both years.  Why not sign up to host the Dragonflight Story Game Lounge?  You can even rack up enough hours to get your convention fee reimbursed!  Seriously, if you're going to hang out and game anyway, isn't it a great deal?<br/><br/>Contact me at events2008 [at] dragonflight [dot] org, or Laura at tyrapendragon [at] yahoo [dot] com.  You know you want to!  :-p                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
