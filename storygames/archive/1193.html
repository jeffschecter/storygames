                    As requested, I've started a new thread for anyone who wants to talk about <a href="http://rpgtheoryreview.blogspot.com/2006/08/editorial-actual-play.html" rel="nofollow">this editorial by Mendel Schmiedekamp</a>, to which Andy responded initially in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1177&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow">latest Threads To Watch</a> thread.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>But I HAVE seen people taken to task for having their heads above the clouds, arguing for the sake of discussion, in a shifting, illusory realm that no longer has anything to do with nuts-and-bolts gaming on any level; Using Actual Play as a rallying cry to keep this hazy illusory junk tied to something that could actually be observed or used. </blockquote>
When I read this paragraph what I see is a claim that "Actual Play" is one of many rhetorical tools deployed when someone else is talking about something they don't personally understand. Just like accusing that person of having their head in the clouds (see Aristophanes "The Clouds," to keep our Socratic context.) While I didn't agree with a lot of what Mendel said -- or I guess, a lot of the assumptions that seemed to underly what he was saying -- I do agree that this rhetoric can be wielded inappropriately, and that the general claim that theory can or must be "grounded" in Actual Play to be a bit overstated.<br/><br/>I guess the point I want to make is, it's hard to tell the difference between someone who is engaging in "hazy illusory junk" and someone who is expressing thoughts <i>that you don't understand</i>. (See: general reaction of RPGers to Ron Edwards for years and years.) This leads on the one hand to people who think super-abstract philosophy is even more awesome, because they can't understand it -- on the other hand, it leads to people who assume that anyone saying anything they don't understand is somehow acting superior, purposefully appealing to the former crowd, and doing nothing of any value. In a culture that favours the latter opinion, and provides strong rhetorical tools to support that stance (like, say, "your head is in the clouds" or "show us the Actual Play"), these positions tend to become entrenched. <i>I'm not saying that this is what is currently going on</i>. But I recognize the danger from other places, and I don't think bringing it up is all that crazy.<br/><br/>Theory and empirical evidence (i.e. Actual Play) have a complicated interaction. If you think Actual Play must always come first, or is somehow more real or important than theory, then I too can drop some names -- I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn" rel="nofollow">Thomas Kuhn</a> would like to have a word, for starters, and the list goes on. If you think Actual Play is useful to help explain and elucidate things, I absolutely agree, but that doesn't mean it's the only way -- sometimes you can just say what you mean right off, and it's a lot faster. Maintaining a healthy balance between the two seems the most sensible. And part of that is making sure that when you ask for Actual Play, it is because you actually want to know what this person is talking about -- not because you secretly think they're producing junk.                </div>

Oh, I absolutely agree here.  A lot of (IMO, "dumb" or "nonreflective") people jump to the conclusion that "shared vocabulary = ivory tower wankery".<br/><br/>However, let's compare that to the Theory forums in the last year, where we DO see some real wankery.  That is, check for threads in there that, say, Contracycle posted to. Now, I draw him out only because I remember his behavior. And, while I make an example of him, I also must say that after being called on it, he had turned around and became "more useful" to the project of the Forge (feedback on games).  However, there are tons of threads there where someone takes a concept in, say, French Contemporary Sociology (Baudrillard, whatever), and then start going on for a bit, describing how it might affect the way people think of the Character of the story, or the overall Storytelling process.  Watch the discussion go back and forth between about 3-4 people as they dig deeper into the concepts at hand, providing feedback, arguments, disagreements and the like to something which hasn't shown anything applicable to tabletop game design or play (even though, academically, it's a solid subject and interesting on its own terms even).<br/><br/>So, you gotta think about not just the discussion, but the context around it: Is it at The Forge? Then it better eventually lead to a theory or supposition about behavior or phenomena in game design or game playing. Is it here, at Story Games? Then it better eventually (IMO, "quickly") lead to a theory or supposition about behavior or phenomena in gameplay. Is it on someone's blog? Then they can pretty much carry on all they want, as the direction of their blog is their choice.<br/><br/>And when I say "lead to a theory", I don't mean "imminently provable or disprovable by someone's Actual Play vignette", I mean, "leads to some sort of observable behavior at the table, which Actual Play can confirm the existance of (again, doesn't have to be Yes/No proven, but does have to indicate, "<i>Oh, hey, you're right, Something is Definitely There</i>" Some of the more Out There Forge Theory threads never got to that zone, and were just a tumor (not malignant, but not really helping the organism either) on the overall goals of the Forge. The Forge goals tightened and the tumor was removed.<br/><br/>Let's take a look at some examples of theory and actual play at Story Games.<br/><br/>Over here at Story Games, I say "It's a forum about games, gameplay/'craft' (SHHHH 'CRAFT' IS 'THEORY' BUT DONT TELL ANYONE), and making play better". I get wary that I see so many people join saying (in that application form when you register)  "Hi, I'm working on making a few RPGs and I want some feedback", because that's not really the goal of this place ("The Forge Part Two with Diffferent Moderation").  Since we haven't seen a flood of "Game Design from Scratch" posts here, and what does pop up is focuese and cool, I'm totally letting that slide as in-line with the goals of the forum. If I saw just about everyone new trying to turn "Games and Gaming" into a forum to post their New Game Ideas and the Power 19, I'd put on my surgeon gloves and start looking for my scalpel.  So that's an example of how something can not fix 100% the context of the forum but still "work with it".<br/><br/>Oops too long, (continued)                        </div>

                            (from previous)<br/><br/><br/>Everyone remember "Push/Pull"?  I moderated that heated, HEATED discussion (well, it was just about as heated as things get around here, which just means people bitching at each other in Whispers, but still it was pretty heated for its time here) just a few times with a "Show us how this works in play" or "Tell us what you think this will do to different people with different playstyles" and the like. However, it was a big fat Theory thread, and I suffered its shambling mass to live here on these forums. Why? Not because we could prove it one way or another; the definition of Push and Pull itself were ephemeral and changing, even for the original author.  Rather, I let them live because, even though discussion was heated, we could pretty much all see that <i>Yes, There Is a Behavior Here</i> that Push/Pull pulled out of the shadow into the light. The nature of that behavior, controlling that behavior, and the exact definition of the behavior ("When I drink Red Bull at the gaming table, is that a Push or a Pull?") was wildly debated and criticised.  But most of us saw that, "Yes, there's something here. It might shake a few new ideas loose if we gave it a shot and try to talk about it".  Push/Pull is still wildly debated and generally undefined, but with it it's shown some cool things that people can draw upon in play. So that was something that was teetering on the "Ephemeral vs Grounded" fence of theory that I let stick around here for a while, cause it was generating stuff that was in line with the context of my goals for this site.<br/><br/>I hope that helps explain things a little more, about Actual Play Requirements vs Site Context, and a little history of Theory on the Forge, and Theory and Goals/Theory-in-Context-of-Message-Board-Goals here at S-G.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Great, Andy. One of the reasons I like the discussions here is that you don't get so much theory as "pragmy" - theory about actual things that matter in game design and play, and that often proceed from the actuality to the theory rather than vice versa. <br/><br/>"Hey, this thing I made works, could this be why?"<br/><br/>I have zero patience with theory for its own sake.                        </div>

                            I think Ron Edwards put it well when he wrote (from memory):<br/><br/>"Suppose I held this rock out and it didn't fall? Where's your gravity <i>then</i>, huh?"<br/><br/>Some seem set on 'testing' ideas by spinning hypotheticals. Isn't it a bit more useful to point to some real play (with all the problems that subjective reporting will have) than to hypothesise about games that may never happen?                        </div>

                            Daniel,<br><br>Kuhn is a great person to mention, because his analysis on shifting paradigms shows that a paradigm is replaced by a new one when it turns out to be superior to the old one in addressing actually existing problems.<br><br>That is, new theory needs to prove its value by reference to actual issues that old theory has a hard time explaining.  Because all theoretical frameworks are tools for analysis.<br/><br/>The same thing is true for RPG theory.  People can talk about "RPGs are like Levi-Strauss' rituals" in the abstract all they want, that does nothing for me up to the point where they show how using that analytic toolbox enables us to better understand actual play (which, incidentally, eventually happened).<br/><br/>A related issue is that you can take the boy out of actual play, but you can't take actual play out of the boy.  We're all shaped by our play experiences, and our theories are inevitably based on our experiences.  By sharing our experiences of actual play, we can begin to truly understand each other.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            So there's this whole swath of theory that's basically just about classification, attempting to create"a taxonomy of roleplaying," where various things get sorted into various different imaginary boxes based on whatever point a given taxonomist is trying to make.  GNS is a great example.  Push/Pull is another.  I would argue that most of the "theory" stuff that we do is basically just categorization and the resulting discussions about whether Exception A fits better in the 300s column or the 400s column.  This is us trying to be <i>descriptive</i>.  Here, examples are clearly needed so we know what it is that we're talking about.  Otherwise, mass confusion and misunderstanding is bound to result (as we've seen with both GNS and Push/Pull).<br/><br/>One of the other major swaths of theory is us trying to be <i>prescriptive</i>, saying that if we do X in this case instead of Y, that it'll be much more likely to lead to result Z.  This is where theories or other ideas are applied to try to speculate on what might happen in certain circumstances.  This is damn hard to provide examples for, especially if we're trying to uncover new varieties of play or solve traditional problems in new and unexpected ways.  The best we can usually give are hypothetical examples.  I do think that there is wisdom in pushing people to make their speculative ideas solid enough that people can play through a scene or two and see if what occurs is actually what they expect.  Playtesting is often 20 times more useful than hours and hours of thinking, as I'm sure most of us have experience with.  But it can take a while for people to pull something playable together, so it's important to not expect instant results either.                        </div>

                            In order to be useful to a community of game designers, theory need not have any connection with Actual Play. It must have a connection with Potential Play (Actual Play being a subset of Potential Play). We are not (merely) here to describe what is going on at the table; we are (also) trying to uncover or invent new ways of playing, i.e., new potential play and the means of actualising it. Sometimes the best way to do that is take some piece of abstract theory that you feel is interesting, play around with it, and discover whether it yields new ideas about play or not. The success or failure of such an enterprise cannot be known in advance. Immediately asking for Actual Play examples will nip these enterprises in the bud.<br/><br/>As an actual example consider my old thread on Shared Imagined Space / Shared Text on the Forge. Does it get more abstract than considering the difference between the fiction and the uninterpreted 'text'? Yet, this discussion has in the end informed my design of <i>Shades</i>, because it sensitised me to the difference between accepting a statement made by a player into the 'text' and accepting the statement's accurately describing the fictional world.                        </div>

                            From my point of view we have:<br/>
<br/>
Gaming Hypothesis: 1) A gaming proposition put forth, without any direct connection to its correspondence with factual or experiential data, as the basis for reasoning, discussion, or as a premiss for drawing a conclusion.<br/>
2)  A supposition or conjecture about gaming put forth to account for observable data; a supposition that will draw a conclusion in regards to known facts, which creates a starting point for Gaming Theory.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming Theory: 1) A systematic statement of game rules, applications, or principles to be done or a method of doing it.<br/>
2)  A gaming hypothesis that has been confirmed or observed and is accepted as accounting for results.<br/>
<br/>
So Gaming Hypothesis is the abstracted discussion of an idea or item without observable outcomes, without Actual Play.  And Gaming Theory has been or can be tested readily, and the tests can be repeated to confirm the the theoretical idea.<br/>
<br/>
An artist, scientist, or anyone else who has an unsupported idea has an hypothesis.  Theories may be tested through experimentation.  Experimentation in this venue is actual play. The extension of all this is...<br/>
<br/>
Gaming Proof: a theory that has been confirmed through repeated testing under controlled circumstances.<br/>
---<br/>
Gaming Hypothesis is very useful, but actual Gaming Theory should involve some rudimentary form of testable premiss.<br/>
Example:<br/>
Gaming Hypothesis:  Olfactory input can influence immersion in role-play.<br/>
Gaming Theory (1):  Scratch-N-Sniff stickers on Character Sheets will enhance the player experience.<br/>
Gaming Theory (2):  Burning incense during gaming sessions impact play.<br/>
Gaming Theory (3):  A pile of rotting pork in the center of the table will generate horror and disgust for my Zombie Apocalypse game.<br/>
<br/>
The theories are all actionable.  And may lay a foundation for rules or structure relating to your game.<br/>

                            I think there's a little bit of fetishization of Actual Play.  Sure, it's awesome, and a great tool.  But it can also lead you down a disastrous path.  <br>
<br>
The GNS theories are founded on the - definitely not disingenuous - actual play experience that most gamers are essentially unhappy, uncommunicative and their games are a foul wasteland of social dysfunction and mainstream games are responsible for reinforcing and reinforcing and reinforcing this until it is an inescapable vale of tears and suffering.  <br>
<br>
Thus when the theory  was unveiled, mainstream gamers whose actual play experience differed went "WTF". It doesn't speak to them and never has.<br>
<br>
So if your actual play experience was typically horrible, you felt liberated, you were all "yes, that's me! That's ME!" And if it wasn't, you felt attacked, you were all "god dammit, how dare you say my fun is bad and cowardly and wrong and only exists on the never-to-be-discussed margin". (The latter group wasn't surprised when the "brain damage" kerfluffle came around because that's exactly how they felt they'd been told they were already.)<br>
<br>
But right now, actual play is all we've got. In other, more developed fields, there are studies done by professionals who are paid money to do them, and which are peer reviewed and tightly controlled, and upon those data are theories built.  Right now, nobody can say for sure what all gamers are like, so no theory will be any good for all gamers unless we stumble across it by accident, blindly in the dark, or lit only fitfully by the guttering candles of actual play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I have trouble finding other people's actual play interesting.  I'd rather read someone's ideas about gaming in general, than about a specific case.  Yes, this means I have to wade through quite a bit of abstract notions, but then, I enjoy the abstract.                        </div>

My 2 cents...<br/>
<br/>
Reading about someone's "actual play" (like in a post to a forum) is not the same thing as observing it.  The experience of the GM (who usually posts) might be very different from some, most, or all of the other players at the table.<br/>
<br/>
I've been listening to Hal and his crew at RPGMP3 on my walk to and from work, and it's the stuff that would never make it into a play report that I find most interesting / useful:  when does the game slow down? when is there confusion about the rules?  when is there a bit of awkward roleplaying?  when is it interesting?  when do the players sound like they're having fun?  All of these observations would be lost in a play report posted to a message board (although getting one or more players own impression of the game is useful as well)<br/>
<br/>
I think RPG theories are interesting, and some good ideas have come out of them... but they're usually very limited in scope -- often being a theory of the playing style of a particular group of people, or style of RPG gamer.  (Explaining the failings of GNS to cover the popularity of D&amp;D (etc) with "Brain Damaged Gamer Syndrome" demonstrates both the limited scope of the theory, and a rather snarky attitude towards people with different tastes in games.)<br/>
<br/>
I think too many RPG theories start with the author's own RPG experiences, rather than considering games more generally, and why people play them.  A proper gaming theory should be able to cover Chess, Tag, Football, D&amp;D, Poker, and even the Lottery.  When you think of RPGs as part of the broader world of games it changes your perspective about why people play some RPGs, and why they might not enjoy others. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            My apologies, I've been away for the weekend. <br>
<br>
My editorial focused on what goes wrong in the social structures surrounding actual play examples. Part of the problem is when we equate the value of these social structures with the value of people actually playing. These are two very different things. My greatest frustration with actual play examples is when they get in the way of doing empirically based theory, when we limit ourselves to anecdote as the only acceptable empirical source. Actual play examples are tools, we must know what they can do and what they cannot. <br>
<br>
Ultimately the most important idea here is that we can and should discuss the value of actual play examples. <br>

                            Thom, your one instance of "hands on" is the definition of "anecdotal."  You're telling us about one time where something happened.  Empirical data is more useful the more there is; if it's just you talking about your experience, it's less useful than fifty people talking about their experiences, which is less useful than a hundred people's experiences, et cetera.                        </div>

                            Mendel- Very interesting points there (and Stuart too). It's making me think of how I use Actual Play myself.<br><br>Actual Play (as "anecdote" or "vignette") also seems something different than "tying theory to practical play".  Before I made this error (well, possible error) of vocabulary:<br><br>ACTUAL PLAY (ACTUAL PLAY EXAMPLES) == THE PROCESS OF TYING THEORY TO PRACTICAL PLAY<br><br>Now I'm thinking of Actual Play as a tool to <b>lead to</b> discussion of practical play.  Practical Play Discussion is still my direction for this site, but I'm gonna do some thinking about how Actual Play Examples and Hands On gets us there.<br><br>Thanks guys, very interesting discussion. <br><br/>Just be wary though, that for every person who says "Hey, dude, your theory is NOTHING without Actual Play examples. Step up or shut up" (and yeah, I agree with that when the tool is used as a philosphical discussion tac-nuke), there's a few people who are thinking that you (Mendel) are saying in your blog that "People who ask for actual play accounts are bullys trying to overthrow your discussion/point".

                            [Edit: I've dumped much of my original blog post and inserted this instead.  Cart before the horse, and all that.]<br/><br/><a href="http://blog.kumapageworks.org/blog/?p=138" rel="nofollow">http://blog.kumapageworks.org/blog/?p=138</a><br/><br/>There seems to be some semantic leakage here when we're talking about <i>theory</i>.  Gaming theory (not <i>game theory</i>, BTW - that's a whole different ball of wax, and people should be more careful about using it, IMHO) - is a theory in a <b>different sense</b> than scientific theory.  Those two senses are delineated well in the OED:<br/><br/>The first sense is <i>theory</i> as in "theory and praxis" - 4.b. That department of an art or technical subject which consists in the knowledge or statement of the facts on which it depends, or of its principles or methods, as distinguished from the practice of it.<br/><br/>The second sense is that of scientific theory - 4. a. A scheme or system of ideas or statements held as an explanation or account of a group of facts or phenomena; a hypothesis that has been confirmed or established by observation or experiment, and is propounded or accepted as accounting for the known facts; a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed.<br/><br/>Gaming theory is <i>not</i> falsifiable in the scientific sense.  You cannot reliably prove that, for example, players have (and are driven by) knowable Creative Agendas.  Part of the problem is that in order to accurately label their creative agendas, they would need to be familiar with the model, and you'd lose the control on the experiment.  You can't prove that the three identified agendas are the only three, or that they are some fundamental basis by which others are created.  You just can't.  So the idea that actual play can help 'prove' the validity of one theory over another is out the window right from the get-go, and comparison to scientific theory is just plain bad mojo.<br/><br/>The best that gaming theory can do is describe what is seen in practice in gaming and do so accurately and fully.  That's the first sense of theory, and the one that most gaming theory follows, including my own AGE Model.  In that sense, you can judge the model on how well it fits the observed act of gaming (actual play), but even if the model correctly describes actual play, it doesn't 'prove' that the model is somehow a causal agent for the play, and that by making conscious manipulations to the model, you can change actual play.  It doesn't work that way.  <br/><br/>Yes, you can build games that use the model causally - but that only proves that you can use a model to create directed action, which isn't all that shocking.  Yes, if people want to believe in the power of Theory X, they can alter their behavior to fit the model.  But that doesn't make the model 'right' - it just means that people are capable of altering their behavior to fit a particular pattern if they see benefit in doing so.<br/><br/>Which is why GNS has never rung true for a lot of people - they're perfectly happy doing what they're doing, and see no large upside from altering their behavior to conform to the requirements of GNS.  Of course, there's the facile notion that these folks are <i>incapable</i> of changing their behavior, but that's pure bullshit.  If there was a significant upshot to people buying into GNS (and GNS-derived games) - if it made them pretty or famous or gave them a 10" dong (metaphorically speaking, mind you), then people would adopt it.  But it doesn't, so people don't.<br/><br/>Well.<br/><br/>That turned into a screed.                        </div>

I'm glad someone articulated this -- I feel like I started this off with my oblique reference to Thomas Kuhn, but I've been trying not to jump back into the discussion to clarify because it seemed like that would probably just focus even more attention on this whole 'gaming theory as science' angle. <br/><br/>The insight I was hoping to evoke via Kuhn was the fact that observers automatically filter their perceptions through the theories/paradigms with which they are already familiar -- there is no pure, "theoryless" observation. Actual Play from someone who subscribes to the Big Model and Actual Play from someone who has no acquaintance with that same model will be different, even if they describe the exact same events. Conversely, someone who is doing analysis from the point of view of a dominant theory will have trouble seeing the possibility of other explanations for the Actual Play. This is all pretty off-topic from the current discussion (as Kuma helpfully pointed out) and I probably shouldn't have mentioned Kuhn at all in the first place.                        </div>

It is only after the paradigm gets accepted that the necessary refinements occur that make the system work better than its predecessor.<br/><br/>[Victor says]<br/><i>It must have a connection with Potential Play (Actual Play being a subset of Potential Play).

This touches on and extends Jonathan's points--theory can not only be descriptive and prescriptive, but constructive, in the sense of making possible a space in which new sorts of prescriptions and descriptions occur.  So long as the speculation is regularly checked by its reflection in its application in possible play, we are good.<br/><br/>Entire aside which I can't quite restrain--falsifiability only defines a narrow band of scientific discourse.  A lot more is about figuring which unfalsified and potentially unfalsifiable model works best, and where it works.  Game theory and scientific theory have a lot in common in this regard.  Of course, I have some theoretical commitments riding on the permeability of theoretical discourse which have nothing to do with gaming, so I'll shut up about it.                        </div>

                            In General:<br/>
Game designers talk about scientific principles from sociology, psychology, and even mathematic probability in regards to their craft.  The application of extensions of these principles to actual work in the Gaming Field shouldn't be a completely anoetic concept.  Gaming Theory or Hypothesis or what ever it is called by the person addressing the general idea, need not deal with vagueries, but can deal in observable and identifiable trends.  Applying practice to principle.<br/>
<br/>
As to hands on:<br/>
Anecdotal accounts are subjective accounts, not objective.  Hands on was not the best use of words for my intent, but I was thinking along the lines of the methods used in Psychological studies.  In a perfect world employing double-blind to get cleaner data would be one approach that would, if there were time, resources, and motivation to set it up, distill objective data from subjective data in a test group.  Admittedly this extreme is highly impractical, unless WOTC decides thay want to blow a good portion of their budget funding this sort of research.  In the more practical terms, I've been using a suggestion given on the play-testing discussion I started to get some objective data that I don't have a direct face to face connection with, but is more focused and directed with questionaires than anectdotal accounts.                        </div>

                            Wow. I hesitate to get off into comments about GNS, because it's not the point. I'll just say that a lot being attributed to it here isn't accurate. In any case, as Kuma points out the theory is of that second type, something that professor Edwards the scientist has been quick to point out from the beginning. <br><br>I think that generally the problem here is trying to discern when somebody is being intellectually dishonest with demanding something like an actual play example. Sure, that's possible, and bad when it happens. But I'm not going to begin to speculate on just how often it's actually the case. I think everyone will have to make their own determinations. <br><br>But JD's point is correct like Churchill's about democracy which paraphrased is that it's the worst governmental system except for all the rest. Actual play as a laboratory is relatively terrible. But it's all we've got at the moment. <br/><br/>That all said, what people forget is that "not so good" isn't neccessarily actually terrible. That is, I think that by observing actual play and using it as a basis for supporting hypotheses and this non-scientific sort of theory, that important work has been done. And will continue to be done. <br/><br/>The Forge Theory forum was not closed because Ron feels that the only way to get at truth is through Actual Play. It was simply what was working best at the time, when the actual Theory forum wasn't really producing anything at all. I don't think he expected pure theory talk to die. I think he expected that it would come here and other places like it where it could start up again and potentially be productive. <br/><br/>Note that in the end, we agreed with Chris Lehrich and gang that pure theory that has no practical value should be allowed. While not all of us find it interesting, we'd agree that if that's what gets you thinking, that eventually such perigrinations of thought might in the end lead back to RPGs somehow. Or even benefit the world in some other way. So, fine. Theorize. <br/><br/>What I'm not seeing is anyone (anyone I respect) saying that they can't speak about theory without backing it up with actual play. I see strong suggestions that people should think about finding some sort of anecdotal evidence in some cases. And, yeah, the occasional yobbo who is intellectually dishonest. But nowhere that there's some blanket expectation that actual play is always required before one can talk of theory. <br/><br/>Mike                        </br></br></br></br></div>

I think people bring the tools they know.  If your background is science, you think in terms of theories and testing them with experiments. If your background is Computer Programming, you think about systems and sub-routines.<br/>
<br/>
There are other disciplines that seem well suited for RPG theory including: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_theory" rel="nofollow">Literary Theory</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Theory" rel="nofollow">Film Theory</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_Studies" rel="nofollow">Performance Studies</a>, etc.  So I don't think the laboratory model is the only way to look at things...                        </div>

                            Let me be clear. I guess I'm an Actual Play snob, too in some ways. Basically, quite often people will put a hypothetical to me about play, and say, "What do I do about this?" For instance, a player said to me recently about HQ, "Should I limit augments?" Under the notion that augmenting would get out of hand. My response was that it never does in the acutal play that I have, and that they should try it themselves before going and altering rules that might work fine for them in actual play. <br/><br/>I do feel that when you're talking about practice, that testing in actual play is the only way to go. I can't be certain that the player's fears won't come to light. Maybe his players will augment too much. But, my experience being what it is with actual play, what do you expect me to tell him? <br/><br/>The laboratory thing is an analogy. Actual play is, well, actual play. From what I can tell of all of the other sorts of theory there, they all rely on actual execution as the final check of the validity of the theories. Actual play is parallel to, say, actually making a film. No difference here.<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Fair enough. I think simply being aware of the issue helps. I'm not accusing anyone of intentional bullying. But keeping in mind that double standards can happen unconsciously can help prevent the unintentional bullying. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And on the subject of categories of theory, I find them less than helpful. To my mind, a theory is always validated by its predictions, regardless of whether these are predictions of an experiment, of a new observation, or of the product of a particular process or craft. The use of a theory also relies on it being comprehensible and fairly compact, but many theories that fail to make predictions or fail to make accurate predictions can be easily understood. Indeed, the predictions of a theory is what makes theory useful. <br/>

I spent much of my undergraduate career (degree in Literary Studies) planning to enter a graduate program in literature. But my intensive study of literary theory soured me on it by the time I finished my thesis. I won't speak to the other two bodies of study you mentioned, as I don't have much hands-on experience with them, but I consider the state of literary theory to be a prime example of why The Forge's insistence on actual play is brilliant.<br/><br/>The focus on actual play helps ensure that our theory is practical, applicable theory. It is focused on creating different types of experience at the table and understanding how those experiences are created so as to make them replicable.<br/><br/>Most literary theory is about as far from that as possible. It's not about creating better literature. Only at its edges does it even consider how to better express an idea or a feeling or a tone to a reader. Most literary criticism resulting from literary theory is nothing more than a soapbox which seeks to justify one philosphical stance or the other using a particular text as a jumping off point, whether the intentions of the author or the context of the text make that meaningful or not. It's simply not a practical theory, which probably explains why it is nearly irrelevant these days. <br/><br/>I agree with Ron's and The Forge's stance because it means that new ideas will be applicable at a gaming table. Does that mean that you always have to see a behavior at the table before you can talk about it? Absolutely not. But come on folks, if you have an idea about a certain behavior you'd like to evoke at the table, then try to evoke it at the table! It's that simple. Did it work? If yes, great! Post about it and what happened. If not, great! Post about what you did, what you were trying to do, and the conclusions you came to. Then others have some context with which to discuss the idea with you.                        </div>

So you might say that some calls for Actual play could be like a filmmaker telling a film critic they need to make a movie before they can have an opinion. ;D<br/>

And, yeah, I still feel uneasy about it. Play since then - the very few reports I've had - has had mixed results. So even with a game like that, experimental, and for limited publication (part of the NPA), still needs playtesting. I know several things that I'd improve with it. <br/><br/>Anyhow, that experience has simply heightened my feeling that the test of a product is in play. Capsule reviews are great for generating interest, but are not to be trusted for quality.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stuart Robertson</cite>So you might say that some calls for Actual play could be like a filmmaker telling a film critic they need to make a movie before they can have an opinion. ;D</blockquote>
Actually, it'd be more like saying, "At least -watch- the movie before you can criticize it".  As other people have mentioned, you can also learn from watching a game even if you're not playing in it.  But it does indicate that you're dealing with actual people, actually playing, as opposed to hypothetical possibilities without any real grounding.                        </div>

                            If you're developing a game, you'll want to test it.  If you're making a movie, you'll want to test screen it.<br/>
<br/>
If you're discussing a technique, or concept, or theme or whatever, you can do that without having to go through the process of making and testing either a game or a movie.<br/>
<br/>
You can read a finished game, concept for a game, or even just a game mechanic and say "MAN, that's BAD!" and be totally correct without having to actually play it.  You can do the same with a movie.  You might miss something unexpectedly good that happens during the game, or during the film -- but you can use your experience to make a judgement on the expected quality of the finished product without actual viewing / playing.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't believe me, I'll find an actual game and an actual movie that I'm 99.9% sure none of us has seen or played, and you should reasonably be able to determine it's a bad movie / bad game without having any actual play / viewing experience. ;D                        </div>

                            The other part people are missing out here is that rpgs typically have a lot of crossover experience.  My Actual Play experience with Game X can tell me a lot about Game Y if they share a lot of common structures to play.  <br/><br/>For example- White Wolf games pretty much are the same system, with different widgets for each game, you don't need to play them all to really get an idea of how they work, because experience with one of them will quickly familiarize you with the others.<br/><br/>But, of course, you needed that initial Actual Play experience to even know what the heck you're talking about.<br/><br/>The situation where you see non-play becoming problematic is where someone has zero experience with the thing they're talking about.  For example, "Inspectres cannot possibly work!  You can't have people trading narration!  The whole game will fall apart!"  Yet, people do play it, and it works.  The person who said this has no experience with narration trading, and can't see how it functions.  The only way to show this person that such a thing -can- work, is to go to Actual Play.                        </div>

                            I personally struggle to understand the argument that actual play should somehow not be necessary for understanding what the heck roleplaying is about. I think it's absolutely vital.<br/><br/>On my local Danish forum there's lot of grumblings when I ask for actual play examples to illustrate points. In many cases the reason for the opposition is painfully simple: the people involved in discussions are not actually playing, just blabbering about it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is it's damn hard to write a good AP. Some people write great, enjoyable reports that lift the game's experience to a higher level and touch on understanding not only the game better, but also the participants and roleplaying theory in general.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21003.0" rel="nofollow">[Contenders] The folks next door </a><br/><br/>I rest my case <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Per                        </div>

                            The reason I think actual play is fairly critical is that otherwise things can get abstruse pretty fast.<br/><br/>Mike uses the HQ example, and I think it is a good one.  People sometimes get hung up on abstruse rules issues that rarely if ever arise in actual play.  A game with lousy falling damage rules gets criticised as broken, even though in actual play those rules are virtually never used.  I see that sort of thing all the time.<br/><br/>With respect to hazy illusory junk, probably the easiest and most effective way to tell if someone is posting their idea poorly so that it is hard to follow, is posting something unintuitive that you are personally finding hard to follow due to your own lack of understanding or is posting crap is to ask for an actual play example.  They are illustrative in a way that extra theory is not.<br/><br/>"Hi, I saw you were talking about how Vampire's mechanics don't support it's flavour text.  I didn't really have that problem, could you post an actual play example of what you mean?" is a fair question, the example will illustrate exactly what the original poster was trying to say and can then be considered.  If they have no actual play example, if it is pure theory, then if your actual play experience is to the contrary it's probably pretty safe to figure that they're wrong.<br/><br/>Also, while many games can be fairly easily analysed on paper, some do play differently than they read.  I am a huge fan of Space 1889, a game that reads terribly, but in actual play tends to be a lot of fun.  If you have comments on Space 1889, then unless you have actual play experience of it or something sufficiently comparable that you can meaningfully extrapolate I think it's fair to say "actual play does not bear out your theories".<br/><br/>Leaving aside whether gaming theory is scientific or not, it is about something that actually exists.  It is, ultimately, about the actual play experience.  Tying it regularly back to actual play tests if theories are useful (at least to someone anyway) and keeps them from devolving into irrelevance.<br/><br/>bankuei's Inspectres example is spot on.  Recently on rpg.net a poster talked about how shared GM responsibilites could not work, flatly could not under almost any conceivable circumstance.  The only sensible answer to that is actual play, theory by itself won't cut it, you need hard evidence to the contrary and that hard evidence does exist.<br/><br/>As for the not understanding bit, I tend to find that if something cannot be stated in a way that is capable of being understood the odds are the person saying it doesn't themselves understand it as well as they think they do.  I communicate for a living, most people can understand most things if properly explained in the first place.  A demand for actual play is generally not IMO a form of attack, it is a request for a more comprehensible explanation.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite><cite>Posted By: Stuart Robertson</cite>You can read a finished game, concept for a game, or even just a game mechanic and say "MAN, that's BAD!" and be totally correct without having to actually play it.</blockquote>
People can also read a finished game and say, "MAN, that's BAD!" and be totally wrong. That has happened over and over to indie games, especially avant-garde games like Capes, Dogs, et multiple cetera.<br/><br/>If someone actually PLAYS a game, and finds that something doesn't work or isn't to their taste, however, it's pretty hard to tell them they're WRONG.<br/><br/>One thing I think is not recognised as much as it could be, is that it can be sensible to take a view without playing even though that view may be wrong.<br/><br/>We only have so much time at our disposal.  Often I will read a game, decide it is not for me or that it's rules suck and move on.<br/><br/>Sometimes I will be wrong.  Had I actually played, I would have seen that I was wrong.  But, I only have so much time, it is simply more efficient to occasionally be wrong than to give every game a chance.<br/><br/>I think actual play is a great tool for discussing games, but sometimes we have to make decisions swiftly and I think it is entirely fair to say "hey, I looked at HQ but it didn't look to me like it would work with all the augments and stuff".  People have to take a view, given the limits on time we all have.  It only becomes a problem if, once someone responds by saying that augments work fine, you keep insisting they don't.<br/><br/>We all have to make decisions based on ignorance, I think it's only when we refuse to take into account new data that becomes problematic.                        </div>

Ah, well, that's just being irrational.  Sadly it is quite common, particularly with new editions of much loved games, but to be honest I tend to disregard anyone who seems to have a mission in relation to a game they haven't played - whether they are attacking it or supporting it.<br/><br/>Someone saying "I didn't buy x because it didn't look like something I would enjoy" I respect.  Someone saying "Game x suxxors/roxxors" who has never in fact played it, I get more suspicious.<br/><br/>That said, I haven't yet played PTA and I do sing its praises, so I shall have to be sure to disregard myself in future when I do that.                        </div>

In particular many people are confounding actual play, actual play examples, and the social mechanisms behind how actual play are used. These are all distinct, and the value of one (such as gaining play experiences) does not naturally translate to the others. <br/>

So what what do actual play format examples do to theory? What does the social framework around how we use these examples do to theory?<br/>
<br/>
To my mind, part of the distinction is between clarifying theory and validating theory. Examples are well suited to the former, and not for the later. <br/>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Why do you think actual play is not suited to validating theory?  Since by and large the purpose of theory is to get better actual play, how can one possibly validate theory except by reference to actual play?<br/><br/>More precisely, since I'm not sure validation is really key, what use is theory if not to inform and improve actual play?  Theory isn't an end in itself after all.                        </div>

Absolutely, I see actual play as crucial precisely because it cuts through posturing and empty theory.  If I argue that aggressive scene framing is railroading, and your actual play experience is that that isn't necessarily true, then clearly my argument is incorrect and at best all I can say is that aggressive scene framing can lead to railroading.  If I have no countervailing actual play to refer to, I don't think I can credibly say anything  much at that point, as my theory (that aggressive scene framing is a form of railroading) has been disproved (invalidated) by actual play experience.<br/><br/>Actual play is an antidote in this way to prejudice, in the sense of prejudging things.<br/><br/>Note, I don't actually think aggressive scene framing is comparable to railroading, it's just an example argument.                        </div>

                            I'm gonna try not to drift the thread too much further, but I'm highly skeptical of anyone who claims to know a game is terrible without playing it. D&amp;D 3.0 and 3.5 read horribly. They read like textbooks. Bad textbooks. But they're exceptionally rad games.                        </div>

You are confusing actual play examples with actual play. <br/>
<br/>
Considering you are using leading questions (instead of asking asking me to clarify my position, you are asking me for justification of a different position entirely), it might be illuminating for you to describe how you use requests for actual play examples in RPG discussions and, if you would be so open, what outcome you want from that request. <br/>

                            Mendel,<br/><br/>I don't think I am confusing the two, rather I think examples of actual play are the only way we have of knowing what is happening in actual play we don't ourselves participate in.  They are an imperfect tool, but often all we have.<br/><br/>I found your second paragraph surprisingly hostile in tone.  You said that actual play was not useful to validating theory.  I queried that and asked a follow up question, not a leading question since I don't know your answer and don't have an answer I am specifically trying to elucidate from you.  My first question related to your statement, my follow up was not directly related but rather was developing a line of thought that I think relevant.<br/><br/>To respond to your query, there are a variety of ways I might ask for an actual play example.  If someone makes an assertion about a game that I find surprising or unintuitive I may ask for an actual play example to see if this is something they have actually encountered.  For example, if someone says the duel of wits mechanic in BW is broken I might enquire whether they had encountered problems with it in actual play or whether that was a view they had taken on reading it.  Alternatively, if someone says "I am persuaded that theory x is correct, and from that I conclude activity y is a problem at the gaming table" I think it is sensible to ask if that person has ever seen problem y occur at the gaming table.<br/><br/>Recently on rpg.net someone asserted that play with shared GM responsibilities was inevitably flawed, could not be successfully achieved.  In fact, they did have actual play experience but I think it is reasonable in that instance to say "have you actually encountered that or is that a conclusion you have reached without seeing it actually occur?"<br/><br/>Similarly, to take JDCorley's DnD example, if someone says DnD is a horrifically bad game I think it is fair to ask if they have ever played it.  The question isn't conclusive, but it is often illuminating.<br/><br/>Routinely I see people asserting that games and mechanics are broken, when that person has no actual play experience of the mechanic and when those who do have actual play experience have not had the same problem.  Actual play matters, games are tools and it is in their use that we see how good or bad they are as tools.  Actual play is not always essential, if a game is similar to others one knows well one can sensibly extrapolate, but actual play is very useful.<br/><br/>With respect to theory more generally, as I said, the purpose of theory is to inform and improve actual play.  Thus, when a theory is advanced I think it is fair to test how it acts to inform and improve actual play.  Not aggressively, one doesn't want to choke a theory that simply isn't that developed yet but that might have potential, but ultimately theory has a purpose and if we cannot relate it to actual play it is sterile.<br/><br/>Of course, you may well disagree, but if so I would ask what purpose do you think theory serves if not to inform and improve actual play?                        </div>

                            I just thought I'd toss in a slightly different POV for one second. <br/><br/>As someone who has worked on those "evil traditional games" as a designer and writer, I have seen infinite amounts of disccusion about games I've worked on and playtested and played. I have talked with a lot of other designers who have done the same. And one of the things I hear from other writers over and over and over is that on any given game's mailing list it very quickly becomes very easy to tell who is actually playing the game and who is not based on the kind of questions they ask and posts they make. I find this to be true to my own experience as well. On any given mailing list I can usually tell with 90% accuracy who is actually playing the game and who isn't. <br/><br/>If that was where it ended, it wouldn't be an issue. The thing about it is that that difference gets used as a reason to dismiss the concerns and positions of those in the "wrong" group. Despite the fact that many companies make at least a reasonable percentage of their profits from games that they know are being targeted at readers as well as players, anyone who "only reads" is dismissed as not having any moral or substantive weight to their concerns -- even when their concerns are over textual elements like implied sexism, racism, or ignorance of real world matieral the book is based upon. <br/><br/>Its right there, at that moment, when it goes from being a simple observation to a value judgement. And at that moment it becomes a rhetorical stance and arugmentative position. <br/><br/>Now, do we do the same thing in the indie community of total enlightenment? <br/><br/>Oh hell yes. It's not as pervasive, and its not as... Janus like in most situations (we aren't usually making games we know are being marketed to readers), but it is there. The ability to throw down actual play and a history of actual play posts under one's belt does result in a change of status that is very possibly out of proportion to the actual value of the play or the play posts. <br/><br/>The reason that this is a such a sticky wicket is that everything else that Mike and Max are saying is about 100% correct from where I am sitting. Just because something is also used as a rhetorical stance does not mean it does not also have real value. In fact the best rhetorical positions are those based on real value.                        </div>

                            Tribe 8 strikes me as a game that had a strong following of readers as well as players.  Lots of folk got real pleasure from reading those books, and since their money is as good as anyone elses it probably is fair that their voices should have weight, I'm not trying to imply they shouldn't.<br/><br/>In fact, to be honest, I didn't have the reader/player split in mind though it is clearly relevant.  I was thinking more of readers who comment on how something plays without actually playing, which is a small but sometimes very vocal subset of readers.<br/><br/>The example I most had in mind was with the new MRQ and with the new Cyberpunk.  With the former, people with no play experience have been making a lot of noise about how certain mechanics are broken.  They may be right, but those who are playing are not supporting them in it at which point I start to wonder why they are pursuing the point.  The sensible thing would be to walk away.  With 2030, one  particular poster made a series of quite aggressive posts about how much it rocked long before as it turned out he had even read the game.  Again, that throws doubt on his views.<br/><br/>I would draw a clear distinction between both those groups and someone reading Tribe 8 for pleasure who had an issue with text in the game.  That latter person is commenting on something which is genuinely affecting their enjoyment, the MRQ and 2030 guys were commenting on something that actually had not impinged on their enjoyment as they didn't have the game to enjoy in the first place.<br/><br/>Anyway, hopefully that's clearer.  I'm very tired right now so will log off, should anything read strangely please query it and chalk it down to poor phrasing from fatigue, I'm definitely not trying to say that readers should be ignored or that all commentary without play is invalid.  Readers can and do sometimes matter, commentary without play can be entirely informed.  I just think commentary with play tends to be better informed where that is practical.                        </div>

The series ending book for OWoD Werewolf was explicitly marketed not only to people who would use it in play but also to those who were reading and wanted to know how it would all end.  Readers are a real market, whether they distort the utility of games to players and whether they are a sustainable market I think is interesting but a topic for another thread.                        </div>

                            I think that Mendel's objection to your line of questioning is that he hasn't said that acutal play is a problematic source for data or anything. What he's talking about is the tactic of requesting that people present actual play to support their theory. What he's saying, and he'll correct me if I'm wrong, is that oft times people suspecting you haven't actually tested your hypothesis in actual play, will ask for actual play as a way of invalidating your position. <br/><br/>"Oh, you haven't tried this out? Well, then your position is invalid."<br/><br/>My point is that what one should say is, "Has this been tested? No? Well, it would be good to see the results if it were." I think this is the usual attitude, but to the extent that people actually do the former, Mendel is right. It's not correct to stifle hypothesis by pointing out that they've not been tested. It's only correct to point out that it's a hypothesis. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Well, I recently said that I wasn't prepared to deal with a hypothesis regarding sim and narr play. I think that specific statement was justified; because it came down to a pretty kooky hypothetical set-up, and that's very irritating when you're trying to keep the discussion grounded.                        </div>

                            Vaxalon,<br/><br/>Tribe 8 was (perhaps is, not sure if it's still in print) a game with several supplements.  First edition adopted the tactic of having much key setting material contained in text presented in the form of stories or in-character dialogue.  The advantage of that for some is that it brings the setting to life in a very effective way, for others it makes it difficult to use as they prefer a more textbook like approach.  I fall in the latter camp, so struggled to play the game as I didn't find the flavour text that interesting or useful, but those who like flavour text got really fired up as it was apparently very good flavour text.<br/><br/>The other side of the coin is that the flavour text driven approach made it IMO particularly good for people who were reading rather than playing.  Note, I'm not saying it was bad for people playing, lots of people played and loved it, just that the approach it took had the added effect of being particularly useful to people reading.<br/><br/>It's a very well regarded game, but I think its sales were not all they could have been in part due to the way the setting was presented.  Second edition I understand manages to balance flavour with accessibility better and IIRC that was a key goal for it.<br/><br/>Mike, fair enough and noted, but has anyone done that?  I was trying to be at pains (though possibly failing) to say that the lack of actual play does not mean one's opinion is necessarily invalid, Droog did recently say he wasn't prepared to deal with a hypothesis on those grounds but I was in that thread I think and he was polite and ultimately there was nothing dismissive in it.  I read it as him saying that without actual play examples he found the example too abstruse to be usefully responded to, and that seems to me a fair thing for him to say.  With hindsight, I think he was right insofar as if none of us had a relevant actual play example I think we did have to ask ourselves if we really had enough data to meaningfully discuss the point being made.<br/><br/>I guess I'm struggling with the hypothesis here.  I don't see people using demands for actual play as a means of invalidating a position, I think it's a straw man.  What I often see is people saying "you say x, but my actual play experience is y, have you encountered x in actual play?" and I think that is a fair question, as x is generally a statement about actual play.  The MRQ example is a good one here, or the guy on rpg.net saying that shared GM responsibility games invariably did not work.  Citing actual play did invalidate his position, but that was because his statement was a positive one about actual play that in fact was wrong.  The tactic wasn't a quashing, it was the application of data.                        </div>

My apologies on the delay, story games ate my previous response I have been too busy to get back to rewriting it. I would also like to apologize if my tone was hostile.<br/>
<br/>
First, for clarification, actual play examples are certainly not the only means we have to connect theory and play, rather their prevalence has stifled the alternatives. Of note, I suggested one such alternative in my original editorial. <br/>
<br/>
Second, I personally believe theory and play are very closely linked, but since this is largely external to this discussion, I'm willing to break that matter off to a different thread.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the requests for actual play examples, would I be over-generalizing if described as you request actual play examples from people who present points you find difficult to believe or accept? If so, would an actual play example, no matter how sparse, change your position? How much detail would be required? How many examples? How personalized is that criteria (examples of games of which you are familiar, etc.)? Are there positions which you would not accept given any amount of actual play examples? How explicit are you about these conditions when you request actual play examples? <br/>
<br/>
Actual play examples are fairly easy to present. The problem is that they warp the following discourse, now the discussion of theory becomes a defense of the example or an attempt to de-educate from the assumptions produced by circumstantial details of the example. And, since it is only an example, the persuasive power is limited, it can always be ignored as spurious. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fred,<br/>
<br/>
Intent I cannot know, but I've seen the effect. Blanket requesting of actual play is a directive to derail your discussion or end it right now. This happens all the time, but for example my recent thread on play controls and immersion. (Of note, I don't believe Joshua was intending to derail the thread, but it happened nonetheless.) Indeed, asking someone to validate through actual play examples is a rhetorical attack, regardless of the intent of the requester or the play experiences of the responder. Asking for specific clarification is worthwhile, but the question of the validity of an idea and the clarity by which it is understood are separate entities. <br/>

                            It's the conceptual linkage between actual play and scientific method I don't like.  Actual play as "beta testing", or "feedback" is fantastic and essential.  But unless you have more controls in the experiment, you can't be sure what you're observing supports your claim broadly, or simply for the specific individuals you play with.  A large number of actual play examples, with a wider number of groups, over a longer period of time, carries much more weight when trying to prove or disprove a theory on gaming.  A small number of actual play examples is annecdotal, and certainly interesting and useful, but ultimately not all that much better than fictitious play examples when discussing game <i>theory</i>. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>

                            Hey there,<br><br>First off, I shouldn't have made a comment about hostility, I should rather have queried whether I had correctly understood the direction of your remarks.  The hostility query I think was inappropriate with hindsight so sorry about that.<br><br>I agree actual play examples are not the only means, I simply think they are a particularly powerful means.  That said, I shall reread your editorial as I would be delighted by the addition of other powerful tools.<br><br>With respect to requests for actual play, I tend to ask for them on one of two grounds:<br><br>1.  I simply cannot understand the point someone is trying to make.  In that case, the request is not an expression of incredulity, it is a recognition that communication is failing and an attempt to find another way to illustrate their point.  Sometimes people use different language for very similar things, an actual play example can sometimes illustrate that what someone is talking about is something that in fact I am familiar with, but which they were describing in language that for whatever reason I found unclear.  Thus it can be a way of reapproaching a point so as to better understand it.  Necessarily then, I only do that where the person's point seems to me to be worth considering but where I think as presented I am not able to properly consider it.  It is then of course a matter for them whether they wish to bother illustrating it or move on and either is fine.<br/><br/>2.  Separately, if someone is making assertions that I find incredible or unlikely, actual play examples can be useful.  I don't overformalise this, people can come back and ask why I think it would be useful after all.  But, it does change my views.  I was originally firmly of the view that the Decipher LotR rpg was pretty much unplayable as written.  However, some of those fond of the game pointed out to me that they played it as written and it worked well for them.  Really on that example no further data is needed, I had made a strong assertion - that it was unplayable - and the existence of any actual play data to the contrary pretty much proved me wrong.<br/><br/>I don't see asking for an actual play example as a way of putting down the other guy, I see it as an opportunity to educate myself.  If say Bankuei posts about how a technique has worked for him, and I can't see why it would be useful, asking him for an actual play example might help illustrate to me why that technique was useful and whether it might also be useful to me.<br/><br/>Now, sometimes I do challenge people (though not very often at all I don't think).  If someone is making an assertion I regard as being driven more by dogma than reason, I will ask if they have actually experienced that thing in play.  But that's not that common, partly because it's generally obvious when that is happening and partly because I get little personal value from people who are looking to grind their axes.  Usually I would only challenge someone in that way if I did not myself have actual play experience and was concerned to understand whether they had a real point or were simply gunning for the game.  An example of that would be if someone were repeatedly posting about how rule x in a game is broken, I think it is fair to ask them if it has actually caused them problems in actual play, particularly if people who are playing are not finding it a problem.  <br/><br/>As for is there anything I would not accept, the only thing I would not accept is an absolute statement that contradicted my own actual play experience because as a matter of logic a statement cannot be absolute and have exceptions.  So, if someone said "you can never have fun running Pendragon, it cannot be enjoyed" I would know that was factually wrong because I have enjoyed playing it.  That runs both ways, I accepted I was wrong on LotR because a single person saying that they had run and enjoyed it necessarily made my position wrong as a matter of logic.  However, if someone said "almost nobody can enjoy Pendragon" I would find that surprising and unlikely but in the absence of better evidence I couldn't simply dismiss it, they may be right after all.<br/><br/>Generally though, I ask stuff because I want to understand someone's perspective better.  If I ask for an actual play example, it is because I think it will aid communication in some way, it's not a judo trick to take them down.  When Droog on rpg.net challenged people for actual play, that was fair, if only because in the absence of actual play it was questionable whether the discussion had any purpose or was simply theory for its own sake.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a rhetorical attack, whenever I ask someone if they have actual play experience I hope the answer is yes.  I would far rather find myself wrong and faced with an interesting new idea than be right and no further forward.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Would it make any difference if Lincoln and Presley in my previous post were replaced with my name and a friend's name?<br><br/>Often yes, but sometimes hypotheticals can get very stretched.  That thread Droog was talking about, hypotheticals were cited but (and I don't recall the precise details anymore) they were so far from what anyone there had actually seen they didn't really shed much light.<br/><br/>Also, often if a point is born of someone's actual experiences an actual play anecdote will illustrate it better than a hypothetical.<br/><br/>But hypotheticals definitely have value.  If we're discussing whiffing it's not a difficult concept, but if we happen to be missing each other a simple hypothetical will be fine to clear that up - there's no need there for actual play to be necessary to illustrate such a well known problem.                        </br></div>

<br/>On that thread, I think the difficulty was simply that people were struggling to understand what you were getting at.  I appreciate the actual play request may have choked discussion, but I think discussion was doomed anyway as people were struggling to see where the point was going.  I saw the actual play request as a desire to understand your point and consequently a desire for examples that would bring it to life.  <br/><br/>I saw that more as Joshua saying "I want to understand this thing you're saying, but I'm not so could you give me an actual play example?"  I think it was a positive thing, not a stifling.<br/><br/>Stuart, in case I was unclear, I think hypotheticals have tremendous value in the majority of cases, however I think there are some specific cases where hypotheticals don't cut it.  That said, if I ask someone for an actual play example I think it's generally pretty fair for them to say "I don't have one to hand, but hypothetically it would look like this..."                        </div>

I'm curious about what that would be -- in terms of theory, not the testing / feedback of a specific game.  Do you have an... um... actual example? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Stuart,<br><br/>Sort of, hopefully Droog will correct me if I misremember.<br/><br/>Recently on rpg.net some of those of us who are unconvinced by GNS tried to explore what might work better than sim, more accurately we were arguing that sim currently contains two (and possibly more) conflicting CAs and that there are in fact more than three CAs.<br/><br/>So, some of the folk who think GNS works fine quite fairly said, you are positing that GNS is inadequate and that a better theory would be more like GN???.  Can you give us actual play examples illustrating the CA you think are currently wedged into S but which really are different to each other so as really to be new CA not presently captured.<br/><br/>IIRC, I don't think we managed and I think Droog bailed on the basis that without that he couldn't really usefully respond, as GNS looked fine to him and we didn't have good counterexamples.  Again, I may misremember so Droog if you see this please feel free to correct me.<br/><br/>Now, I still think GNS is flawed, but I think it was a good challenge, I don't think the alternative was yet sufficiently useful and I think the lack of concrete actual play examples helped illustrate that and show that we were not at that point on a productive line of thought.  Perhaps with time we may be, perhaps we're wrong, but the point is that by requesting actual play examples Droog helped illustrate a wooliness in our thinking that at the very least merited further consideration and which also made it fair for him to effectively say "I don't think this is useful, if you get somewhere then I'll take a look then".                        </br></div>

                            I used to play with this guy, Dr. Zhivago all the time. He was really into immersive play -- really got into the escapist side of RPGs, you know the wish-fulfillment, alternate life type stuff?  Anyway, we were playing this D&amp;D game and we had a few other people in the group -- Chuck Norris was totally into Min/Maxing his characters, Bea Arthur was playing this elven wanderer on a quest for her soul... or something... anyway she was really into telling this story about her character through the game.  Oh yeah, Ozzy was the GM and totally into the newest rules supplement to add things like Jousting rules and mechanics for siege engines -- which was weird because we almost never used that stuff...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Dr. Zhivago got seperated from the rest of the group in the dungeon and he encountered an Owlbear!  We kept telling him to just fight it -- he'd probably win -- but he didn't want his character to die, so he <i>ran away from it!</i>  He went down the wrong passage and found his way blocked by a portcullis!  So he had an Owlbear behind him and the bars in front of him.  We kept telling him to just fight it, but he wouldn't.  We told him his guy was a fighter, and he'd written on the character sheet that he was really brave, and really -- he had pretty good odds at winning... but he wanted to try to lift the gate and run away instead.  Of course the % to do that sucked, and the Owlbear ended up ripping his character in two.  And you know what?  Dr. Zhivago started to cry -- he was so upset his character had died.  Seriously!<br/>
<br/>
There you go.  I'll leave it to you to guess whether that's a true story with fake names, or a fake story with fake names. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah -- I think GNS doesn't adequately cover Immersion (as in character) which is a big part of playing RPGs for a lot of people. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            I offer <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21258.0" rel="nofollow">[Vampire 2E Sabbat] Of Evil and of Simulationism</a> as a target for discussion. In it, Frank T. proposes some theories about GNS relating to Simulationism, I don't get it, and I ask him for some Actual Play examples to demonstrate what he's talking about, and he takes it as a brush-off. Enjoy.                        </div>

No, you're quite correct. Thanks for explaining.                        </div>
