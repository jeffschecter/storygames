He was the one pushing for early playtests, waving the game in people's faces and bigging up the project whenever we went to conventions together.<br/><br/>I'm no expert, but I recommend visiting the local universities. In Ireland, lots of the gaming happens at university gaming societies. If you pitch the game right and plead for help, the society chairpeople might promote a playtesting event for you. If you follow that up with appearances at the local conventions (not the big, mega ones), pitching your playtest to the con directors, you could garner support there too.<br/><br/>By the time I did that, Hell for Leather had become attractive enough for a couple of blind parties to give it a whirl. Nevertheless, 90% of the playtests have come from a core group of nine gamers in the UK and Ireland. Lucky, lucky me.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the game's still not ready to print. I've learned something about the creative process. You can't force it. As hard as I try, as many APs I generate and tweaks I engineer, this game seems like it will be ready on its own terms, not mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273637/#Comment_273637" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T04:36:16+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  4:36AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what I usually do.

There's a whole lot of indie games where I've bought the PDF, liked it, and payed for the book solely because I enjoyed the game enough to want to encourage its designer to keep doing that kind of thing, and because the printed book was sufficient "value added" to make it worth my while to be "charitable" like that. <br/><br/>Also, as the "Blood and Honor" thread shows, aggressive pricing goes a long way. I was among the "sure, I'll pay 5 bucks for that" crowd, when I probably wouldn't have shelled out more money for a book without further buzz for the game. <br/><br/>So, I guess my overall point is that I don't think releasing a free version will "shoot yourself in the foot", especially if there's a little something extra in the final pay-for version, so I think you're on the right track!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274425/#Comment_274425" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T03:06:53+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  3:06AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2010 3:07AM by Graham.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, be careful with this.

It's not like an obscure site.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>What's the point of CC if you set those conditions on it?</blockquote>\nWhat's the point of distributing a "free" version of a game, if not under this CC ? I mean, if someone download it and "copy" it to a friend, it is, in fact, a copyright infringement. Yeah, I know, you won't sue someone for that, but ...<br/>As for writing "you have the right to copy and distribute this pdf", I wouldn't bet my shirt it has legal value. Anyway, yes there is a point in using this CC.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Don't you<i>want</i>people to be inspired by your game and create derivative works?</blockquote>\nYeah, so ... They'll contact you, you'll waive the CC license for this particular you trust and he'll be able to create derivative works.

It has all the stuff to get you playing, but it's missing the shiny bits. I think that's enough of a difference to encourage fans to buy the final product. Furthermore, there'll be differences between this text and the print text, even if it's just a couple of guidelines. That's enough of a difference for <i>me </i>to want the original.<br/><br/>I still intend to publish, and pretty soon. I've been encouraged by some recent playtests and I don't feel like I'm too far from the finished piece. I'm hoping to revise the final draft by the first week of August so it will be printed and in my hands by October. I've kind of got this deadline thing I need to stick to. So, this next eight weeks will be feedback time, garnering council from the kind hearts like Malcolm Craig, Gregor Hutton, Joe Prince, Harv Barker, Alessandro Piroddi, Joe Murphy and the home crew. I owe these guys too much love.<br/><br/>In the mean time, I'm going to tidy up a few suggestions here and there and think about releasing the CC version sometime next week.

The trick is selecting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_tracker" rel="nofollow">torrent tracker</a> for your .torrent file. This is server that is used as the initial coordination point for people interested in the torrent. Trouble is, most places don't offer tracking to the general public. You typically need to be a "member" of the site, which is often a huge pain in the ass, as most of these places have digital versions of Masonic handshakes needed to get into the thing.<br/><br/>At the time my only real choice was Pirate Bay, which then promptly got arrested and such.<br/><br/>If I had to do it again, I'd try <a>OpenBitTorrent</a>.<br/><br/>One thing to note: while you often see torrent files hosted on the sites that track them, this is not actually required. For example, I hosted the .torrent file myself, even though the tracker was Pirate Bay.<br/><br/>Anyone who wants to give this a try, let me know and I can help test the .torrent and will seed the file.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275199/#Comment_275199" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-09T13:36:44+00:00" title="June  9, 2010  1:36PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah I'd recommend piratebay and demonoid.

I have a policy of buying a physical copy of any game I run, even if there is a legal and free electronic version, so this isn't just theoretical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275496/#Comment_275496" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T06:40:56+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  6:40AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2010 6:04PM by Sebastian.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've finalised the free edition <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/games/hell-for-leather/#downloads" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>It's a bundle of stuff, from cheat sheets to the complete game text.<br/><br/>I've decided to stick with good old fashioned copyright.
