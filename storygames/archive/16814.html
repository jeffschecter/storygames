I like 'em a lot, that goes without saying. But my tastes have changed over the years.<br/>Maybe yours did, too.<br/><br/>I started in grade school in the 80s, playing the Red Box edition of D&amp;D. I learned it was more fun to play pretend when you didn't argue about who died and who missed.<br/>Then I moved on to Marvel Superheroes and Paranoia. Paranoia taught me that it was okay to make things up outside the module and to "fudge" rolls. Marvel taught me that, even though I'd rather choose who I am in a game, it's sometimes fun to have other people make changes or accept their suggestions.<br/>Then along came Call of Cthulhu... where I learned that it was more fun to just give players the clues they needed so we could all enjoy the mystery.<br/>After that I played West End Games Star Wars, Cyberpunk, Teenagers from Outer Space and Ghostbusters, all of which taught me that it's cool to give players points with which to influence events. They also taught me that my imagination isn't always the most important one in the room.<br/>By then I'd got into college (1989) and played just a whole bunch of stuff. TORG, Nightlife, Ars Magica and, God Help Me, WoD (although we defaulted to Hunter's Hunted stuff.) These games all taught me that style over substance sells (but not forever.) Players like what they like. Also, I learned that people don't cooperate just because the rules say they should. They cooperate in exchange for a reward.<br/>The 90s brought In Nomine, which taught me that interesting dice conventions need to be focused in order to work. I also played Feng Shui, which taught me that what you need to do something ought to be available when you think it ought to be done.<br/>They also brought Castle Falkenstein which taught me that having more control over what happens to your character, or being able to better anticipate the choices you're going to make is a lot of fun and makes you feel more confident. I thought cards were the only way to do that for a long time.<br/>Near the end of that decade I got into Unknown Armies, which taught me that watching my character change emotionally (primarily with its Stress/Rage/Fear/Noble/Obsession) system was satisfying and that people will do insane things for a bonus to their rolls. Oh, and FUDGE. How could I forget FUDGE, which taught me how to divorce system from genre and then recombine them in ways that made more sense.<br/>And about that time I got into story games. I'd heard about them here and there, read some of Lumpley's essays, but PrimeTime Adventures was my first one and I thought, "hey, some of these guys have learned the same things I did... but they took it a step further!"<br/><br/>What kind of learning process made other people think getting on this site was a good idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383715/#Comment_383715" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T07:38:36+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  7:38AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, for me it's just another skill set under my hat.

I bought some at the Orc's Nest when I visited England in... crap, was it 93? Yeah. I think it was. I'd seen the place advertised and when I went to London I just had to stick my head in. Anyway, White Wolf put out these poorly-perforated 8x11 sheets with cards like "The Path of Intrigue" which had vaguely-defined tropes on them.<br/><br/>Like all other style-over-substance play, not much thought had gone into how you might use these items. They were just some cards with events that a GM could attempt to work into a storyline or a player could play - but there were no circumstances in which the player was empowered to do so (the GM could always override.)<br/><br/>Which brings me to TORG: it was very much about the gloss. Although it had some interesting ideas, like the drama deck, they were tacked on to chase prevailing trends. TORG has some great terms "Storm Knights," "Eternity Shard," and, my favorite "The Gaunt Man" - but it's basically just someone else's story with an exploding-results d20. (The Gaunt Man is even written off as the main villain before play really begins.) It also does its damndest to make sure that player input means nothing, even with such a great opening as the Drama Deck. Like a lot of games in that period, the look of the thing was great but it didn't really do what it promised. I know there's a lot of die-hard TORG fans out there, but that's how I felt. Also, in that time period, the media was pretty much harping on the "style over substance" philosophy as being a good one.<br/><br/>(Nightlife was actually less style-over-substance than White Wolf, but it was still a system from an older game with another genre painted on top of it. What Nightlife COULD have been was Hip Urban Hammer-Horror-Film Monsters Fight Cthulhu-Like Beings from The Subway Dimensions under NYC. What it ended up being was a little bit less fun than It Came From the Late, Late, Late Show - put out by the same publisher, as I recall.)<br/><br/>Oh, and ALL nostalgia is morbid. It's an attempt to hold on to the past as you hurtle toward the future which - last I checked in lieu of adequate cloning technology or even mind-taping techniques - includes death. Or heat death, depending on your long-term view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384482/#Comment_384482" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-07T08:58:28+00:00" title="July  7, 2012  8:58AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that style over substance ( which I associate as a phrase with the Cyberpunk rpg) has a bit to do with what John Kim is talking about in this quote, above : <br/><br/>"From D&amp;D I learned about role-playing (and especially that <b>my early RPGs were just pretend play with the name D&amp;D</b>).
