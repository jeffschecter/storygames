I proposed several games and systems to them, and they chose D&amp;D as it was the only one on the list they were familiar with.  We will also be running a Savage World game, so other systems are not completely alien to them.<br/><br/>After reading some Actual Play both here and elsewhere, I have come to really like the Aspect/Compel system from SotC.  I think it does two things regular D&amp;D doesn't support well.  It encourages group play, even if one character is the focus of a given scene.  And it, in my head at least, helps shift task resolution to conflict resolution.  Or what I mean more appropriately than that is it encourages players to think about they are trying to accomplish (I want to add/discover an Aspect, and then use it), rather than just declaring an action.<br/><br/>So I am wondering to myself if it is possible to overlay this system onto the backbone of D20.  The D20 system would still be used to make skill checks, run combat, etc.. but each player will be able to compel and be compelled ala SotC.<br/><br/>Some basic thoughts on how this would work.<br/><br/>1.)  Each character will have a pool of fate points (hero points really as I am running Eberron)<br/>2.)  Hero Points can be used in the normal Eberron way (to stabilize, to add 1d6 to a roll, to power certain feats)<br/>3.)  Each character will start with some number of Aspects.  One for nationality/race, one for their best stat, one for their worst stat, one for a favorite skill, maybe a couple from growing up, maybe a couple for the Last War.<br/>4.)  Hero points will be given out to compel their aspects.<br/>5.)  Hero points can be spent by a player to invoke one of their aspects to add +2 to a roll.  Rules for the number of times this can occur for an action is just like SotC.<br/>6.)  Characters can tag a scene or adversary with an aspect.  How this works in a social scene is pretty straightforward.  How this works in combat, with D&amp;D's various combat options is a little up in the air.  Characters can then invoke this aspect once for free.<br/>7.)  Characters can invoke a scene\xe2\u20ac\u2122s or adversary\xe2\u20ac\u2122s aspects to add +2 (or -2 depending on situation) by spending a Hero point.<br/>8.)  Characters can use Sense Motive, Gather Information, appropriate knowledge skill, bardic knowledge, etc.. to discover an aspect of a place or adversary.<br/><br/>I have just bought the Spirit of the Century rulebook, so some of terminology might be off.  I will refine this model as I deepen my understanding of the mechanic.<br/><br/>So some basic questions/call for ideas.<br/><br/>How many fate/hero points should I give out at the beginning of each session?  Eberron has the number based on level, and they are a static amount that don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t increase or refresh until the character gains a level.  For the characters I will be running, they would normally start with 5 or 6 hero points.<br/><br/>How many Aspects?  One consideration for this question is that the characters will not know each before action begins.  This may be fatal flaw, and certainly does not exploit one of SotC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s best ideas.  I definitely want their Aspects to reflect their character stats to some degree, as well as the socio/political aspects of Eberron life.  Any brilliant ideas on how to handle this?<br/><br/>The area I am most worried about the interaction between the two rule sets is in combat.  I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want the tag/compel system to overrule or make obsolete D&amp;D\xe2\u20ac\u2122s very strategic combat system (which I think may be part of the draw to D&amp;D).  I also don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to \xe2\u20ac\u0153forget\xe2\u20ac\x9d about the tag/compel system during combat.  I am thinking right now that if D&amp;D combat has a rule for it, it takes precedent.  So if a hero tries to trip the adversary, we use D&amp;D.  If a hero wants to add a \xe2\u20ac\u0153Distracted\xe2\u20ac\x9d tag to an adversary, they can do that so long as the specific idea isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t already covered.  If a hero casts Grease, we follow those rules, but if they want to spill oil onto the deck of the ship, then the deck is tagged with the aspect \xe2\u20ac\u0153Slippery\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  So are there any pitfalls anyone can foresee?  Or will just winging it pretty much work?<br/><br/>Thank you for any feedback!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meej" title="Meej"><img alt="Meej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meej">Meej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71149/#Comment_71149" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T13:31:11+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  1:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you've got a disconnect if Hero Points can be spent generically for a +1d6 bonus as in Eberron, but only for a flat +2 (ie, a 10% bump) when used with an Aspect, which is the situation it should really rock in.<br/><br/>+2 and -2 are a big deal in SotC/FATE/Fudge.  In d20, they're not worth much.  I'd really, really suggest beefing those up to a +5, at minimum, or maybe (to keep with the generic Hero Point +1d6 use) going with 2d6 for them.  Players will always be looking for the Aspect angle, then, rather than just spending them for 1d6.  Which is <b>good</b>.<br/><br/>I'd also drop the requirement for Aspects to tie to Nationality/race, stats, etc.  They certainly <b>can</b>, if the players want 'em to.  But Aspects are meant to highlight what's important to the player.  We already know the character's best and worst stats, etc.  Let the Aspects have the option to say something new.<br/><br/>Lastly, I'd allow something like an opposed Attack Roll as a SotC Maneuver (ie, set up a temporary Aspect, etc).  Maneuvers are the grease that makes SotC pulpy action run; make sure to find some way to implement them.  They'll rock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71199/#Comment_71199" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T17:21:14+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  5:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2007 5:22PM by Mel_White.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a neat idea.  Another option for aspects is to tie them to alignment.  So a Lawful Good character would have the 'aspect of Law' and the 'aspect of Good'.  That character could then be compelled (and rewarded) for actions in accord with his alignment--answering the king's summons, saving the villagers in need...A character with the 'aspect of chaos' gets rewarded for demonstrating her individuality, independence, for breaking traditions or expectations, etc.   <br/>What I've found is missing from action points in D&amp;D is a means of earning those points during play.  Bringing in the idea of aspects and compels establishes an exchange system for action points.  I've done something similar in a D&amp;D game at Dreamation--allowing the players to earn action points by highlighting a character flaw or trait (both from Unearthed Arcana) that puts the character at a disadvantage.  Adding more aspects--to scenes, to characters--should be easy enough.  And, as Meej implies, above, let the action points be spent in accordance with established D&amp;D rules (add 1d6, power a feat, etc.).  The important thing is that there is an exchange system for action points--a way to spend them and a way to earn them.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M" title="Robert M"><img alt="Robert M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20M">Robert M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71209/#Comment_71209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T18:03:58+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  6:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Mel and Meej for your input.<br/><br/>I think I will drop the standard add 1d6 to a roll use of Hero points, and instead use Meej's idea of adding +5 for invoking an Aspect.<br/><br/>I was hovering toward letting the Aspects be all Player created, and trusting them to incorporate the world into their Aspects, but then Mel had the awesome idea of having Alignment truly mean something!

To clear, I was just kidding with the faux-tags.  I made a bad joke; It just sounded like something he might say, and it seemed semi-to-the point, thus with the potential for humor.  Sorry for any confusion or offense.  I doubt I would seriously quote someone in another context (like, say, an article) to advance my point.  Aristotle says that the argument from authority is the weakest kind...and he should know!  Hah!  See what I did there?!<br/><br/>Anyway.  I understand and agree that combat (and/or the strategy of combat, etc.) will change with aspects added.  I agree further that inasmuch as the intent of a game designer is only reflected in what is included in his game, that this change would be against his intention.  However, in my earlier comment, I was considering things from the thought that the principal worry was what the players, not the designers, would think.  If they enjoy strategic experiences and are familiar with D&amp;D, then a strategic experience that is D&amp;D with another significant factor laid atop/injected into it seems like it might be within their capacity to also enjoy.  But the opposite might be true also.  Robert will certainly soon know for sure.<br/><br/>Elmago, I'm really interested in what you mean by flavor and, as someone who's played D&amp;D and FATE, how you would characterize their respective flavors.  Is it dependent on what sort of considerations become strategic, or how many of them there are, or what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
