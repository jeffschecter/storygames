It boils down to this:<br/><br/>"We're changeling mage soldiers.  We were ignorant of everything around us for years.  We're pissed.  We want our potential back.  Everyone who wants us to stay ignorant:  Your ass is grass."<br/><br/>Though that's a tad on the nose.  How well does the story get that across?<br/><br/>I'm a little irritated that I resorted to using "Creature: The Theme" games as the basis of how character creation works, although I think I did it well... any comments on the particular splats, ways of doing it better, rotten tomatoes, assorted chunks of masonry?<br/><br/>There's the first stirrings of a system here, in the splats that describe how your character acts, the Win Mission -&gt; Inspiration or Victory-&gt; Can use magic -&gt; Can Win Mission etc. win spiral and the  Prohibition -&gt; Despair -&gt; Can't use magic -&gt; Fall back on prohibited behavior death spiral.  That's really what I want comments on.<br/>---<br/><br/>Black Sheep<br/><br/>1.) What is your game about?<br/>Once upon a time, the Faerie returned to Earth as our Shepherds.  <br/><br/>That was long, long ago, and we are used to being their sheep, now.  <br/><br/>They lead us to beautiful pastures and we have our fill, and when our time comes, they honor one of us by have us as their concubines and sup upon our thoughts, leaving only our shells behind to still serve them.<br/><br/>It is not a hard life, always to walk upon all fours.<br/><br/>But I must choose to walk on two.<br/><br/>For I, you see, was taken from the cradle by the Shepherds to serve as their Changeling soldier.  Not even stolen, for my parents considered it a blessing that I was chosen.  A blessing!<br/><br/>I am one of the True Folk.  I learned the art of seeing Truth beyond the power of man or fae, so strong that I could only speak falsehoods at great cost.<br/><br/>And I saw the Truth of my parentage.<br/><br/>The Truth of my heritage.<br/><br/>And I have never felt such rage.<br/><br/>I have fled the service of the Shepherds.  <br/><br/>Among me stand others of the True, the Fair, the Strange and the Charmed who have served their false masters, but now wish to serve their true parents.<br/><br/>We want our stolen childhoods revenged, though earning them back may be beyond our power.<br/><br/>But at least we black sheep may earn for the right to stand on two legs.<br/> <br/>2.) What do the characters do?<br/>The characters in Black Sheep have a mission - what they must do.  The missions are:<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tDisrupt the Shepherds\xe2\u20ac\u2122 offenses.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tProtect <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Gain new</span> allies and supplies.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tReveal significant secrets of the Shepherds.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tAwaken the lost sciences of Humanity.<br/><br/>The characters in also have an Art \xe2\u20ac\u201c the kind of magic that they wield and what they mustn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t do.  They are:<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tThe True have extrasensory perception and must not lie.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tThe Fair have telepathic powers and must not refuse to aid someone who asks for and needs it.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tThe Charmed have probability manipulation and must not turn down a challenge they can win.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2\tThe Strange have metamorphosis powers and must not kill.<br/><br/>3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?<br/>The players try to trap the GM in a death spiral: each time that a character fulfills a mission while avoiding a \xe2\u20ac\u0153mustn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t,\xe2\u20ac\x9d they can either regain a point of magical power \xe2\u20ac\u201c Inspiration \xe2\u20ac\u201c or check off a point of Victory on the GM\xe2\u20ac\u2122s sheet.  Every 6 points of Victory translates to a permanent, lasting victory; a Changing of the Hour.  13 Changes of the Hour means that the players have broken the hold of the Shepherds forever.  12, actually, as the game begins with the first Hour.  With each Changing of the Hour, the players get to permanently keep a plot device.<br/><br/>However, the GM is trying to trap the PLAYERS in a death spiral.  Each character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u0153mustn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t\xe2\u20ac\x9d will either erase a point of Inspiration or give a character a temporary point of Despair.  Every six temporary points of Despair gives you a permanent point of Despair.  The difficulty of all magic, or roll testing Will To Carry On, is equal to \xe2\u20ac\u0153Roll your Despair or more successes on up to six dice.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  Each character begins with at least 1 point of permanent Despair.  When they get their 7th point, they will fail their next roll testing Will to Carry On.<br/><br/>So \xe2\u20ac\u201c the GM tries to make life hell for the characters, yet fun for the players, and the players try to win.<br/>---<br/><br/>Freakin typo.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
