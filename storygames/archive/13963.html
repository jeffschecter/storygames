I agree 100%<br/><br/>If the fruit of the game is fun, but the peeling of the fruit is catharsis or intellectual debate or problem solving or community building or even inner reflection... what is wrong with that? The THEORY OF FUN speaks to the idea that FUN is an inherent tool of growing up. All cultures engage in fun, and without knowing it, learn about the world around them. A child would never want to realize that sharing his hot wheels is teaching something about the universe around him, but from a "book-learner" point of view, that's exactly what play and fun teach.<br/><br/>However, the older we get, the more SKIN we need on that fun because a video game about hot wheels wouldn't entertain the way killing zombies would. Or would it?<br/><br/>I have been working closely with a small university on helping them build a game design program at their school. And one of the headaches I continue to encounter in dealing with Admin, Profs, and Students is the difference between games and entertainment. You'd be surprised how entrenched people get in their opinions without knowing a thing about how the gaming industries operate.<br/><br/>"I don't like art.

If you focus on differences it can be alienating, and give people the idea you're trying to fix something that for them isn't broken. And it can present a distorted picture of what the thing is.

One person insisted upon posting about 10 times to declare and re-declare that he wasn't satisfied with the version I'd previously published in 2006 and that I should feel ashamed of myself for releasing a revised edition. He offered no constructive criticism. He offered no sensible solution to his perceived problem. He contributed nothing in posts subsequent to the first. He merely hung around to tell me that I was doing it wrong.<br/><br/>This is a common phenomenon on the internet. People feel that they have the right to complain and be validated as a result. That's already a weird assumption, but it translates into an even weirder one: they then go on to believe they have the duty to complain.<br/><br/>It's not about recognizing criticism, in this case. It's about recognizing that someone is here to shit on your parade.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316840/#Comment_316840" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T13:03:07+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  1:03PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "It's not about recognizing criticism, in this case.

Some folks see others having a good time, perhaps marching in a parade, and are filled with the urge to despoil, yes perhaps even cover it with their own human filth. <br/><br/>Why do they do this?<br/> Somewhere along the line they learned that good times could be had by putting others down, that it was a way to gain power and agency. Where did they ever get such a notion? Gee. I don't know, maybe in monopoly where you are either in the lead or twiddling your thumbs watching your opponent's Scottie Dog (my personal fav) run victory laps around the board.<br/><br/>In early childhood development, this is pre-empathy behavior. The goal is to get kids (and adults) to figure out that we have a better time when we work together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316855/#Comment_316855" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T14:36:29+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  2:36PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I knew it.

They're the ones truly not interested. Or more likely to be there. The others are more... self entitled. Perhaps some are just people who try to help others with their design and could word it better. Maybe.</blockquote>\nYou're projecting the self entitlement there. You're expecting that people should like what's put out, or at least pretend to.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>You're missing the point. It's rather like polling. If most people express disinterest, you're probably just making it for yourself, and if you're doing that there's probably no point. You'd at least want to play the game with someone, or at least have someone read it. If neither happens, it might as well not exist.</blockquote>\nRobin,<br/><br/>The thing being discussed here is different, I think.<br/><br/>I can offer a case study: when I released Perfect recently, there were lots of people replying that they really liked the new version. One person insisted upon posting about 10 times to declare and re-declare that he wasn't satisfied with the version I'd previously published in 2006 and that I should feel ashamed of myself for releasing a revised edition. He offered no constructive criticism. He offered no sensible solution to his perceived problem. He contributed nothing in posts subsequent to the first. He merely hung around to tell me that I was doing it wrong.<br/><br/>This is a common phenomenon on the internet. People feel that they have the right to complain and be validated as a result. That's already a weird assumption, but it translates into an even weirder one: they then go on to believe they have the duty to complain.<br/><br/>It's not about recognizing criticism, in this case. It's about recognizing that someone is here to shit on your parade.<br/><br/>That's not at all what Matthijs was talking about in his OP though.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Robin, you could perhaps see it that way if...<br/>- A lot of people answered<br/>- They were representative of your target audience<br/><br/>However, often the people who go "this doesn't look fun to me! stop doing it!" are not your target audience; and one or two or three people complaining about other people's ideas on the internet don't really make for a big representative group of anything. They're just people being negative on the internet.</blockquote>\nCompared to how many people who are being positive? It's not like you're going to get a particularly large sample of responses to begin with for a game like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316867/#Comment_316867" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-16T15:47:30+00:00" title="March 16, 2011  3:47PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're once more conflating issues here. These are not products people purchased. These are not finished products. These are forum discussions where people are showing interest in something and are told "Why bother? I don't find the issue interesting." And there's actually very little paraphrasing here.<br/><br/>This is not about game design, or "True Honesty Part Five", but "Forum Discussion".<br/>No, it's not for people to take what they're given, and to like it, but that if you don't find a topic interesting? Then stay out of it and don't discuss it. We're not talking about actively dislike something (and again, often entitlement plays a part here - I don't like it, so you shouldn't do it), but just not caring. And by Gorm, we'll make you know how unexcited we are, how unexciting your project is, and how unworthy of anyone putting any time and effort into it it is! Even though we'll pour blood and sweat over it online, all non-chalantly.<br/><br/>And with that, I think my stance is pretty clear. You are of course, entitled to hold your own opinion.
