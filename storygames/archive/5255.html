(Ok, ok, NOT <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>... hmmm... but <i>Contenders</i> hacks pretty well to social conflict... and wouldn't <i>It's Complicated</i> or <i>It Was A Mutual Decision</i> map virtually line-for-line? DAMN, see what I mean?!?!)</blockquote>\nSo, I'm starting THIS thread to see if folks can come up with a movie that's impossible to do, approach, or "get-at" with gaming (for whatever reason: be specific!). I'll start:<br/><br/><i>The Razor's Edge</i> - MAYBE as a solo game, but any notion of group gaming the emotional struggles and angst of one dude as he travels the world, finally returning to where he started but with new insights, is likely to fall a bit flat, seems to me. Good for a rainy, depressing day with close, philosophical friends... but a "game" and not, rather, some kind of group therapy?

I would, just as I did for <i>Razor's Edge</i>--I navel-gaze and pontificate and reflect as much as the next guy, on some seriously abstract shit. But I don't call that "gaming."

They are deep and moving, but I don't see how you would game them. Coming of age, with all that entails, is the reason of the movie, you can't fail to do it, nor is there a direction to the lessons of life that you learn (i.e. an intent to pass or fail ... indeed there are no conflicts in the first place really) except that you learn from them.

Unfortunately, <i>many</i> action movies fit this description, as they are entirely plot-driven. They're also common fodder for gaming. :-/ <br/><br/>Really, any movie that doesn't focus on characters would probably not play out "like an RPG" anyway: where's the role to play? I think most documentaries, especially in the Michael Moore vein of agitprop, would be ungameable...unless you're playing Michael Moore! Do you "win" when you've made your point? When you've ratcheted up your audience's righteous anger? (Some sort of weird inverse <i>Lacuna</i>: you're trying to assault other peoples' heart rates!)<br/><br/>A biopic would be hard to pull off: The character's "need" is sort of subsumed into the function of the movie to convey historical information.

They are deep and moving, but I don't see how you would game them. Coming of age, with all that entails, is the reason of the movie, you can't fail to do it, nor is there a direction to the lessons of life that you learn (i.e. an intent to pass or fail ... indeed there are no conflicts in the first place really) except that you learn from them.</blockquote>\nSure you could.  Since when is playing a game about the end result? Having a "coming of age" would be a really nice structure. I could totally see statting up "adolescent troubles" which are shed in specific ways. You can't get rid of them all, because there's a "time" limit until you grow up. Based on what occurs and the outcome, you narrate how your character turns out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>I think Lost Highway would be hard to game.  It was hard enough to just "get".</blockquote>\nDepends on how well your brain processes David Lynch. My fiancee and her dad are great at finding meaning (not that they always agree, which is why Lynch never explains what he's going for).  However, I came into the thread thinking that I'd love to see tools where you can produce a Lynchian game. I don't understand him enough yet to attempt this (or perhaps attempting it will help me understand him!

Like the Iranian movie with the name I can't remember, which is basically the same style as Koyanisqatsi, only it moves through Iranian history, from ancient times to modern day. I can sort of see a montage movie game, although the "playing a role" part is problematic - but playing a montage-of-Iranian-history game? Take turns framing the visuals of a scene from Iranian history, they must be in chronological order, try and keep it going for as long as possible. I could see that, I guess. That would be a parlor game, with limited conflict going on (OP David wrote: "gaming" but I'd rather just go from an rpg perspective). Playing Shock: with Issues for characters is still gaming a genre - or just gaming a type of story, even, since Shock: isn't exclusively sci-fi, unless you're using the specific issues of the specific film, and even then, you're not guaranteed of getting the same or similar feeling.<br/><br/>As long as a game includes communication with language (I'm lookin' at you rpgs), it's going to have problems translating or recreating the experience of music or images without any narrative content. I could maybe see Wagner, but how do you game Shostakovich?

Since when is playing a game about the end result? Having a "coming of age" would be a really nice structure. I could totally see statting up "adolescent troubles" which are shed in specific ways. You can't get rid of them all, because there's a "time" limit until you grow up. Based on what occurs and the outcome, you narrate how your character turns out.</blockquote>\nMaybe I am just not enough of a story gamer, but I don't see the game in that, just the simulation. Okay sure I could create a character with adolescent troubles I need to get rid of and narrate scenes about experiences that do that ... but why? Of course the OP didn't ask for good gaming, so I'll gracefully surrender on that one. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118708/#Comment_118708" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T04:44:25+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  4:44AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Iwcw6sq-hAY&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">This</a></blockquote>\nWow.

Where LARP Vamp played out at dance clubs across America! Also, it would mesh neatly with Jason's notion in another thread about using dance to resolve conflict.<br><br>Now, that's not to say that you wouldn't be laughed out of a convention (or even your own home) if you broke out the book and suggested a quick one-shot. (Yeah... one-shot to the nose.) Joe, take an "I Coulda Gone My Whole Life Without Seeing That And Died Happy" Point. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/><br/>----<br/>So it looks like folks are bringing out movies that are either highly visual/aural or surreal or lack narrative structure of any kind. Some say, "Sure, I could play that" in response, but I am thinking that comes from (as said above) more of a "simulation" of the movie through conversation than anything close to a role playing game. Put another way, if one can "play Un Chien" then one could "play a photo album." Or another way: if, as Jason said, no movie is impossible to play, and given the range of cinematic weirdness out there (and its parallels to other arts, viz symphony, documentation, art), then it's not a large inductive leap to say "<i>anything</i> can be gamed, period." Opening a can of Spam. The color of clouds in May during a sunset. A D-minor scale. The shape of the color blue while it's screaming.<br/><br/>Or have I leaped too far?<br/>-----<br/>Perhaps a new thread is in order, to get out of "polling mode?" What movie (or other media) experience do you think *should* be a game but isn't supported by any product on the market (of which you are aware)? Such a thread might actually lead to some design inspiration (not to say this one hasn't also!).<br/>[I invite someone else to drive that bus. This one's still got momentum enough for me.]                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
