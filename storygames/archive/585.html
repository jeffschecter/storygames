                    I hold in my hands a very green-and-black copy of the True20 rules, recently purchased in PDF and printed.  While toodling around looking for some discussion on the ruleset, I came across <a href="http://greenronin.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=6253" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> in which Pramas, et al, defend the idea of not making an easily-accessible SRD available for free.<br/><br/>I feel very pissed right now.  One of my things is open gaming architectures - hell, it's what <i>Elsewhere</i>, my big, fat baby, is all about.  So the idea that they make a d20-in-spirit off of the OGL, release content that is 99.9% free and then cover it in a wrapper of IP and ask that people not violate some sort of unwritten code of honor just pisses me off.<br/><br/>I had a similar conversation with Philip Reed (of Ronin Arts - maybe it's the whole 'ronin' thing) when the idea of an OGC wiki was cast about.  He worried that his 100% OGC material sales would be hurt by such a project.  My view of it is that it's 100% free material anyways, so all someone is really paying for is the pretty layout and Christopher Shy art.  I mean - it's Open.  Open is open, for fuck's sake.<br/><br/>I don't get the whole 'open in spirit, but not in fact' thing.  I don't get the weird declarations in <i>Iron Heroes</i> that skirt the d20 STL.  The whole thing drives me right up a goddamn wall.<br/><br/>I say all this as a preamble to the idea that with very little effort on my part, I could turn out 'Veritas20' for free, just for principle.<br/><br/>Drives me nuts.                </div>

                            Arg.  Yeah, this was a tough decision of mine.  I've had an open HTML SRD for True20 for the past year that I showed around to some people, but I haven't been making it open to the public.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem is that in general, I want to help out RPG publishers.  Green Ronin seemed to believe that it would hurt them financially to release it, and I'm willing to believe that.  So given that it would hurt them and it's not like I personally wanted to do anything with that material, I decided to keep a lid on it for a while.  I had originally told myself that I'd release it in a year (which is around now).  And it still really stuck in my craw.                        </div>

                            The way I see it, all of the money they've gotten from the True20 corebook is pure cream anyways, since anyone can re-release the system for free.

Nothing.  The extent of the IP are the words "Green Ronin", "True20", and the trade dress of the book itself.                        </div>

I'd prefer the intellectual honesty of saying that 'the parts taken from d20 must still be open, but all of the stuff that we spent time and energy to create is closed', rather than the current situation of 'open but we'll call you names and ask you to think of the children'.  <br/><br/>Open designation should mean 'steal this material, please - we've got lots of other stuff here we'd rather sell'.  It's dishonest at best, and it hasn't stopped the rights minefield anyways - look at the declaration in <i>Iron Heroes</i> and then tell me what's open and not .<br/><br/>The way I see it, they took the route of open content and already made it a minefield - what would/will Pramas do if you release a True20 SRD?  Technically, he has already given away his rights to do anything - but he's also created an atmosphere where doing something perfectly legal and ethical is framed as unethical at best.                        </div>

                            Yeah, it's a difficult/delicate subject (although it shouldn't be so).  Chris Pramas is a really nice, understanding guy in person and not some screaming freakbone (no one here has been demonizing him, but I've seen it done elsewhere). The problem is that when you're making your meager living off of this stuff, that introduces all new issues and stressors. <br/><br/>Maybe they should have thought about it more when they were building the original Blue Rose. Or maybe they should have thought about publicly making the "True20" title open, "But not now guys, give us say Three Years first". But hindsight and all that.<br/><br/>Technically, there's nothing from stopping John from releasing his document under another name, or Kuma releasing Veritas20 (though the computer backup company Veritas may have obj... oh wait, they were bought out by Symantec, nevermind), and coming up with a unique world for it and simply not referencing True20/Blue Rose.  Heck, I was even thinking of doing so myself for a few minutes. I ended up not going that route because:<br/>1) What, like I need another project? :-)<br/>2) I suck at writing.<br/>3) I couldn't think of a decent world anyway.<br/>4) After poring over Blue Rose, I thought it was cool on many levels, but still had like 30-50% too much d20 baggage (weight carried, etc), so I'd end up having to adjust and adjust to make a system I really was happy with anyway.<br/><br/>BUT, I did catch that thread, and noted that there were a lot of people who wanted to post fan info, or wanted to write fan supplements, or even a whole core book plus setting... There's NOTHING from stopping them, but they couldn't say "Based on True20/Blue Rose" : And it seems like their reasoning isn't that they want the sales from the True20 crowd, but rather that they wanted to give props and Ali-G style "Respect" to True20: "Hey, did you like my game? Well get the hell out there and buy True20!!" Unfortunately, they cannot.<br/><br/>So, IMO, big whoop. I'm hoping that in a year or two they'll announce a timeframe for making that True20 sign "open".  But until that time, if you have a True20 game world sitting in your brain, or a supplement, and have your heart on releasing it (and not just to piggyback off of True20 sales, because at that point WTF, you might as well invest in stocks or something, the payoff is much greater), just put "Veritas20" or "Shin20" (Japanese) or "Riktigt20" (Swedish, on the IKEA tip) on the cover.<br/><br/>Oh, and IIRC Iron Heroes doesn't use d20 anywhere, and I'm not even sure they use OGL, rather selling the game on the merits of its functional d20-like system.                        </div>

                            Actually, they can do that, they just don't have permission to use it in any extensive way. I can put "If you like my adventure, buy the Ed McBain novel 'Goldilocks', you'll really love it." in a text, and although I'm sure it's trademarked and copyrighted and all that, they can't stop me from referring to it.

I find it hard to sympathize.  If you produce something of value, and you can't afford to give it away for free, you shouldn't abandon your property rights. <br/>

(I'm assuming that Mr. Pramas, whom I haven't met and have nothing against, and/or his employers, had a choices about projects to undertake and rights to retain.  This may not be true.)                        </div>

                            I feel like the whole issue is based in fear rather than anything real.  Let's consider the evidence over the last 5 years...<br/><br/>- Freely available sites, such as <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/" rel="nofollow">the Hypertext D20 SRD</a> haven't changed the shopping habits of gamers<br/>- Illegal options such as pirated scans and pdfs also haven't stopped people from buying the legal books<br/>- Mongoose's versions of the PHB, DMG, &amp; Modern, which are smaller, cheaper, and more clearly written haven't caused major waves<br/>- And none of the OGL spinoffs have outsold D&amp;D<br/><br/>Which pretty much indicates that what people are buying is name brand and color, not just mechanics.  (And, since most of the OGL stuff is just slight variations on D&amp;D, it makes sense.  Basically, if all the cars were the same, you'd get more sales based on what colors you had in stock...)                        </div>

                            Can I tell you a story about software?<br/>
<br/>
Wordstar, a word processing program for the CP/M operating system back in the days before DOS was a gleam in Bill Gates's eye, was the first software package to sell a million copies.  It had a horribly counterintuitive command structure (this was way before window systems were common) that relied on magic combinations of letters to get things done.<br/>
<br/>
Well, why did it sell so well?  So many people were using it that there was always an expert around to turn to.  Why were there so many people that could use it in the first place?  Because Wordstar had no copy protection and people freely made copies for each other.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, Wordstar sold a million copies because anybody could have a free copy.<br/>

<p>I get the idea that Green Ronin is not convinced that they can offer their product for free and yet still make a substantial profit on sales, and since they make their living off of it, they can't make a move without being sure they'll still be able to pull in steady salaries. To be fair, it IS counter-intuitive that you can offer a free alternative and still make the same (let alone more) money.</p>
<p>I have seen lots of real-world examples of this nonetheless working nonetheless, but I'll admit to be being biased, since I work in an industry that successfully operates alongside a lot of free-culture-y stuff, and I'm inclined to open content in general.</p>

                            While I dislike the deceptive practice, I'm not convinced that free content availability won't hurting book sales.  I remember James Wallis going on about it a few years ago.  Sure, electronic availability doesn't destroy book sales, but according to James it took a serious chunk out of their sales and profits.  There were some cases where electronic copies of a book had made its rounds, and he noted that sales were markedly lower for those cases.  Personally, I don't know much about the market and I'm not prepared to say what will or will not hurt sales.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm still ticked about their behavior over this, but I'm not going to make claims about sales.                        </div>

                            (Hey kids: mouse over acronyms for explainations!  It's fun and easy to do in your own posts, too!)<br/>
<br/>
From the other side of the Bazaar, the OGL(Open Gaming License) has always looked like a skeezy marketing ploy and nothing more.  I know there's folks here who actually know and work with Open Source Software, and I myself like the principle of that thing.<br/>
<br/>
There's something in me that loves the idea of OSS(Open Source Software) and the GPL(Gnu Public License).  For those not familiar, the GPL(Gnu Public License) basically says "I wrote this, and I think you should be able to see what I did to write it, and make whatever use of it you see fit, except that if you pass your work on my thing on, you have to keep the same terms."  <br/>
<br/>
I just don't see how the GPL(Gnu Public License) realistically applies to a gaming text.  And I certainly don't see how you can claim that d20 is Open the same way that OSS(Open Source Software) is Open.  As I understand it[1] the deal with d20 is that you can either license it for a fee to use wholesale, or you're welcome to refer freely to any main d20 manual when you publish an expansion.  So basically, the so called OGL("Open" Gaming License) is just a way for Hasbro to make more money.  Which Is Not Evil.  But to use the OSS(Open Source Software) model as their supposed basis is, in my opinion, at best deceptive.<br/>
<br/>
The more I reason about the whole issue, the more I think that there isn't a reasonable comparison.  Maybe a analogous license to the GPL(Gnu Public License) would be "you can reuse and rewrite these generic rules to use in your game, so long as you acknowledge me and provide a link to my game in your game, and release your game under this license."  Or something like that.<br/>

                            Judson:<br/><br/>No fee. <br/><br/>You can do a d20 product -- for which the folks must own the D&amp;D player's guide to be able to use it -- or you can do an OGL product -- for which they need nothing but your own lovely book. <br/><br/>Initially the d20 was a big deal, as it had brand identity linked with D&amp;D, and so let you sell product to the biggest gaming market in the whole universe. Now days, however, there are real ways in which the d20 is a curse and the market is shifting towards OGL material -- such as True 20 or Iron Heroes. <br/><br/>Or, you know, away from OGL/d20 completly. It isn't like we've not seen this before. <br/><br/>Anyway, Green Ronin made True 20 based on the OGL liscence, which means that by the liscence their whole game system (pretty close) is now open -- anyone can use it. However the brand identity of "True 20" is Green Ronin's, so while you can legally use their game material you can't (easily, at least) advertise that your product is made to work with their product. To get the ability to use the "True 20" logo and advertize compatibility with Blue Rose you do have to pay a fee.<br/><br/>Notably, this is only a problem if you want to tap their extant market for your game, and even then only if the primary way of doing so is by what is written on the book itself.                        </div>

And there are countercases - such as the guy who wrote <i>Monster Island</i> on his blog, and it's still there for free for anyone who wants to highlight and CTRL-V it into a doc file and print it out ... who got a publishing deal and now bby all accounts has really good sales in the book trade.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter remains that if you like a game book enough, you're going to want to buy a dead-tree version to hold in your hands for a number of reasons.  Until making a book into a dead-tree version yourself is easier and cheaper than buying one from the people who make it, people are going to buy it.  Granted, you're going to lose sales from people who are downloading your book to give it a 'test spin', instead of slapping down cash to buy something on a skim-through in the store.  But those people aren't your customer base to begin with - they're economic voyeurs.  If the bulk of your income is from people who aren't loyal customers, then you have a cash flow problem anyways.                        </div>

Not being able to express compatibility (which is what the d20 STL is all about - but that's another kettle of fish) limits you to simply usingthe text to avoid having to write out all of the cumbersome feat explanations and whatnot.  It's just a way of saving time in writing, without the ability to claim compatibility.                        </div>

<blockquote>Kuma, I want to make sure I'm getting you straight. Your beef is that True20 takes material released by Wizards under OGL, then adds a license which is more restrictive than OGL?</blockquote>
Nope - that'd be against the OGL to begin with - Clause <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.<br/><br/>Green Ronin has abided by all of the terms of the license.  Under the OGL, I have every right to take every single tiddle and jot of the True20 document, copy it verbatim, reformat it and give it away for free.  But what they're doing is creating a <i>prima facia</i> closed system by pressuring end-users not to take advantage of the rights that they have under the license.<br/><br/>That's the crappy part.<br/><br/>Now, what they <b>could</b> have done is designate everything that they got from the d20 SRD open (in fact, they'd have to), but then say in the declaration that everything in Chapters 8, 9 &amp; 10 (let's call it the new class templates, the reputation/conviction system and some new feats).  As long as those chapters contained no content out of some open document, that's their right.<br/><br/>Then there's what malhavoc did with <i>Iron Heroes</i>.  Their declaration is, literally, 'everything in this book that is in the SRD or derived from the SRD is open, everything else isn't'.  Well, what the hell does that mean?  Is the token system for combat open?  Can it be said to be derived from the SRD?  Or are they only talking about trade dress, as in the license?  By not providing a clear declaration and not having a document that is an extract of all the open content in <i>Iron Heroes</i>, they're flouncing close to the limits of the license as well.  <br/><br/>In fact, they're my next target.  After all, if something goes wrong with it, then I have 30 days to correct the breach, which would simply mean removing the PDF from my website.  I have no problem with that, and I'm really getting tired of this open/not-open shell game.                        </div>

<blockquote><i>It's not closed, it's just not free. If you are telling me that me that I'm morally obligated to give away our hard work for free on the internet, I'm going to have to disagree. The OGL provides a way for anyone who wants to access our material. What is doesn't allow them to do is use our Trademarks or logos. <br/><br/>We've been dealing the OGL for longer than anyone and we know the ups, downs, ins, and outs. We have created something in True20 that has a lot of potential and we're going to develop that in the way we deem best. We do not believe that a SRD or a free license to everyone to use our Trademarks would be in our best interest right now. <br/><br/>We are running a business here and all we're trying to do is benefit from our own hard work. We hope people can respect that.</i></blockquote> </div>

<li>An ability to download the entire book as text or XHTML (or, fuck, some sort of standard XML format.)</li>
<li>The ability to enter text as Textile, or maybe some other method. ReStructured Text is probably best, actually.</li>
<li>The ability to control a document - that is, I'm the author, and my work is inviolatable - but the ability for others to comment, or copy my content and alter it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if I extend this for all open game content, I don't need much more besides author controls. Hmm. This sounds like a project that I may have to put on the plate.</p>

<p>Brand,</p>
<p>Thanks. I don't think I've gone far enough, honestly. I won't rest easy until you can get each of my games' text in plain text and XHTML off the web.</p>

                            Add me as another huge fan of your CC stance, Clinton.  I'm in the process of introducing my regular group to TSoY, using the CC text you have on the Anvilwerks website.<br/><br/>The biggest obstacle in the way of my buying a hardcopy version of TSoY, now that I know and love it, is the fact that Canadian Customs is liable to double the listed price on me through GST (nation sales tax, which is fair enough, if unpleasant) and customs handling charges (which are totally outrageous) should the shipment be earmarked for inspection.<br/><br/>For perspective, I won a "free" pair of starters for a new collectible game calles Chizo Rising.  By the time the Canadian governement was done with it, my "free" prize ended up costing something like $25 Canadian.                        </div>

                            Getting Indie games in Canada can, indeed, be a pain. I picked up a truckload at GenCon last year, and will do so again this year. It's just easier.                        </div>
