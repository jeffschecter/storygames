                    (Some of this is cross-posted from a thread on RPG.net)<br/>
<br/>
I picked this game up at Dragonmeet yesterday.  Since there was a lot of buzz about the game and a general consensus that it was going to be "Robin Laws does Investigative games right" I was very curious and more than a little excited to have a look at exactly how the game works.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, this system was created to fix perceived problems with Call Of Cthulu.  I think we can all agree that there are problems with that game that make it utterly unplayable as written.  How many times have you heard the following in a game of CoC:<br/>
<br/>
<b>Player:</b> I'm going to hit the library and see what I can dig up.<br/>
<b>GW :</b> Cool, make a Library Use roll.<br/>
<i>Player picks up d100, rolls and winces.</i><br/>
<b>Player:</b> Ugh, 89, fail.<br/>
<b>GM:</b> Oh, er, um.  Roll again, but try to pass this time, I have handout I need to give you!<br/>
<br/>
Not cool, right?  Stalling games lick balls.  The Gumshoe system seems to be an attempt to rectify that.<br/>
<br/>
I am however, very disappointed with the game.<br/>
<br/>
The Gumshoe system is actually two systems, one for investigation and one for general task/conflict resolution.  The two don't really interact.<br/>
<br/>
For investigation, the system consists of "If there's a clue and you have the one of the skills that's relevant, you find the clue, no need to roll or anything because if you roll, you might fail, and if you fail, the game stalls."  Fair enough, that works but it's basically "if there are two outcomes and one makes the game stall, let the other happen", but with the pretence that, hey player, aren't you clever because you bought the Ballistic Science skill.   There is a little more to it where you can spend resources to get extra info on top of what you need.  So that's ok.  There is a list of about 30 investigative abilities, and each player gets a pool of points to buy them.  A neat mechanic is that you need to make sure that the PCs have at least one point in all these skills between them.  So with fewer players, each player gets more points at character creation.  So essentially the player decide who wants to find which clues, that's about it.<br/>
<br/>
Then you get to the "everything else" system, where what you have is a very light task/conflict resolution system.<br/>
<br/>
Then the following appears (in a sidebar on page 33 entitled "Difficulty Numbers and Story Pacing"):<br/>
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Esoterrorists">Esoterrorists</a> wrote:</div>
<div class="QuoteText">Just as the GUMSHOE system keeps the story moving by making all crucial clues accessible to the characters, <b>GMs must ensure that tests and contests essential to forward narrative momentum can be easily overcome.</b>  Assign relatively low Difficulty Numbers of 4 or less to these crucial plot points.</div>
</blockquote>
Emphasis mine.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the GM sets the difficulty and does not tell the players what it is.  What this means is that, outside of investigation and clue acquisition, the GM still has to fudge things to keep the plot moving along. The players <b>need</b> to sneak into a cannibal compound?  Failure to do so will stall the plot?  Set a low difficulty (ie, fudge it) and hope the players roll well.    Players only rolled a 2 for that crucial test?  Never mind, you can just pretend you had the difficulty set at 2 anyway, just tell them one of the guards has passed out at his post.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's a bit about creating adventures.  It tells you how to create a breadcrumb trail for the players to follow and uses phrases like "don't worry if the player tackle the scenes in a different order to the one you expect them to, they'll cover everything in the end."  Also and a great deal about how to do illusionism.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that the game is without merit or even <b>bad</b>, just that fundamentally, I don't see it as any different from CoC with a houserule for clue finding (ie, any skill heck that could lead to an essential clue automatically passes) and massive GM fiat for other failed skill checks.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, it's just not really what I was hoping/looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a better game (subjectively, for me, imo etc etc) than CoC?  Oh, hell yes.  Is it "done right"?  Not by a long way, "Done Better", not "Done Right".                </div>

                            My personal approach is to have essential plot elements with more than one avenue that is not "Okay I failed, you try..."

How would you do an investigative game that wasn't like this?   I'm not asking you to solve the problem and ,in effect, create a system that would satisify you.  I'm just interested in any thoughts you may have had about how to dispense clues to players and together create a story that leads to a satisfying climax in an investigative scenario.  Do you think such a thing could be done in a way that was satisfying?                        </div>

                            (This is an attempt to explain why game like this don't work for me.  I've only had so much time to think about this, so some of this might be a bit half baked.  Also it might seem a bit numpty, that's me trying to get this stuff straight in my head.)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ShaneJackson</cite>How would you do an investigative game that wasn't like this?</blockquote>
Investigative games (generally) have a clear "Win" condition.  That is, the players "win" if they figure out what was going on, who the murderer was, what the evil cult are up to or whatever, and capture/foil/defeat the bad guy.<br><br>In order to figure out whodunnit, you need to find a series of clues that the GM makes up.  Essentially, the GM creates a series of hoops for the players to jump through and after clearing enough hoops, you ought to be able jump through the last hoop.  That is, figure out the answer that the GM has made up.  If you miss a clue, the GM (if he's any good) usually has a bunch in reserve so you don't have to jump through all the minor hoops to figure out whodunit.<br><br>EsoTerrorists seems to circumvent this problem by having a system that essentially states "you automatically find all the clues".<br><br>But the other problem is, if the players misinterpret a clue or two (or more importantly, how the clues fit together), they jump to the wrong conclusion and the game stalls or ends badly.  I've been in games where the players just weren't ever in a position to make a guess at what was going on because we hadn't asked the "correct" questions.  These questions were known only to the GM and short of reading his mind, there was no way to know what they were.  That's just lousy GMing and not really a system fault per-se, so possibly not that relevant the this conversation.<br><br>But the point is that the players aren't creating the story, the story has already happened and the players are just having it obscurely drip fed to them through the medium of clues.  I'm not really up for doing that to my players (although I appreciate a lot of people are and are having fun playing games like that).<br><br>I think what that all comes down to is that investigative fiction uses the characters who're investigating the mystery to reveal the story.  The story of an episode of CSI isn't about the guys with the microscope and swabs, they're about the guys who robbed the store/killed the vicar/stole the ring.  The villains are the main characters, it's their story and the investigators are just window dressing.  If the players are playing the investigators, they're sidelined, they aren't the focus of the story, they're basically just along for the ride.<br><br>So that, in a nutshell, is the real problem with investigative games.<br><br>So I guess the only way to get around it that I can think of is to give the players some actual authorship.  Start the game with a corpse and actually build the story.  Have no idea who the killer is, what their motive is and how they did it, let that be decided through play.  That's the only way I can see of actually involving the players in an investigation.  Or maybe you brainstorm who id what to whom and why as a group at the start of a session.  Like a "Crime Burner" or something.  Then you run a game and players narrate how their characters solve the crime, knowing OOC what the crime was from the start.  A bit like the spoiler from Colombo, where the audience knows what's going on from the start, but the character doesn't.<br><br>I dunno, I don't really know what the "best" way to do this sort of game is.  I was rather hoping that was what my Â£10 would get me with Esoterrorists.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I would guess from your post that you weren't in one of the demo games, and just read the book when you got back from Dragonmeet. I urge you to try the system in actual play, and look at the experiences of those who did. What you have described here is not a reflection of the experiences of those who have played the game. If this interpretation is what you have managed to extract from your reading of Esoterrorists then we have failed in your case in the sense that your interpretation is not what the game is intended be.<br><br>First, I think you are reading far too much into this quote. The GUMSHOE system is designed to allow players to have essential clues -that's the investgation and interpersonal side. It's not, in this incarnation, a full blown dice-free indie narrative game. <br><br>Second, the general skills include a random element which gives the game the usual advantages and disadvantages of randomness. The general system doesn't prevent GMs accidentally adding creatures which are too tough or physical obstacles which can't be overcome with available resources. This GMing suggestion isn't really saying fudge the difficulty number, but fudge the actual difficulty. In other words, if there is an obstacle and low resources make it a 10 foot chain link fence instead of a 15 foot one, one blood corpse instead of two. Post-roll, any fudging becomes clear, so making something appear difficult then assigning a low difficulty will not work. The system cannot dynamically adjust general difficulty numbers for you; that's something you have to judge yourself. Players have more input than in most traditional rpgs, but it's not a totally player controlled narrative game. <br/><br/>Also, the reason that the GM sets the difficulty number secretly is because it suits the tone of the Esoterrorists background and adds tension, absolutely not to help GMs fudge difficulty. Secret difficulty numbers did annoy some players, but it wasn't anything to do with fudging.
<blockquote>The Esoterrorists setting is meant to be straight-up and brutal horror game. Losing points is meant to hurt. To truly evoke that spirit, the GM never reveals Difficulty Numbers.<br/>GMs running GUMSHOE in non-horror environments, or who wish to water down the settingâ€™s intentional level of oppressive nastiness, may choose to reveal Difficulties.</blockquote>
As for a more player-controlled narrativist version of GUMSHOE - it's in the works. Robin, Ken and I have been discussing it, although I'm not certain who will write it yet. It would a lot better for your type of gaming, I'd imagine. It will work something like this. You use your resources to buy clues which lead the adventure on. You are making up the clues. This is what Ken Hite refers to in Nightmares of mine as a (something like) Schrodinger's Box structure. It's possible that other players could set the cost of buying the clues according to their wishes for the narrative, or their could be an auction if players had opposing ideas. The PCs work with the GM to build the mystery and its possible resolution. How it would work with general skills I don't know. Maybe the GM could set general obstacles, or the general system subsumed into the other mechanics. I still think it would need randomness. These details are mere speculation at this point, and I'm not claiming any originality for this idea.<br/><br/>One final quote from the game, in response to your mention of illusionism:
<blockquote><br/>Fortunately, itâ€™s easier to provide freedom than it is to seem like youâ€™re providing it. Simply ensure that any clue, especially any core clue, is available not only to players using the ability specified in the scenario, but to any player who provides a credible and entertaining alternate method of acquiring that clue. The scenario is a foundation to work from, which ensures that there is at least one way to move through the story. It should never be regarded as the only way to get to the resolution. A group of players will often come up with better ideas than the scenario writer ever could. Give yourself permission to go with them.</blockquote> </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Simon, I don't want to seem like I'm getting all up in your face and being nasty about your companies new game.  I'm not, I think it's actually a pretty decent attempt to fix a perceived problem and works pretty well in that respect.  It's just that I'm frustrated because I thought this was going to work <i>for me</i> and it doesn't.<br/><br/>Reading a game that's crap is one thing.  Reading a game that is so nearly really awesome and yet isn't is much worse if you're me.  That's frustrating, because I can't help thinking "Damn, it's so close...".  I really like Robin's work and I'm probably more bummer because it's like having your favourite band release an album that's only so-so.  I had very high expectations and they just weren't met.<br/><br/>My main complaint about the system is this: The system admits that certain things are "essential to forward narrative momentum".  The entire premise of the investigative system is that, some things just have to succeed, otherwise there's no game.  So how come that philosophy doesn't extend to other things?  How come a clue that's essential to forward narrative momentum is given automatically, but an equally important action (like sneaking into the aforementioned cannibal compound) does not succeed automatically?  In what way is having the game stall because the PCs fail to climb a fence different to having it stall because they fail to find a bloodstain?<br/><br/>It's almost as if the system doesn't have the courage of it's convictions and says "it's OK to stall the game because of this, but not because of that".  That the main thing that doesn't work for me.  Plus the whole breadcrumb thing, but that's another problem and not really the one that I was expecting Esoterrorists to solve.<br/><br/>I think that for the vast majority of people, this is a great game.  It clearly identifies and does away with one of the major problems of investigative games (how to make sure characters don't miss clues) and offers some pretty solid advice on how to alleviate another one (how to make sure that the players interpret clues correctly).<br/><br/>Interestingly, I'd be quite happy to play in a game, just not to run one.  I want more mechanical tools to support me as a GM when I run a game.  I'm lazy like that.                        </div>

                            Thanks for all your feedback. I certainly don't consider it to be anything other than constructive.<br/><br/>You were in effect hoping for a completely different game, one that this game was never intended to be. Personally, in the game as written, I'd rather have randomness and the chance of failure when encountering opponents, rather than buying my way past them with game resources. There are other games I've played which address this differently, and I enjoy them in a different way. <br/><br/>GUMSHOE is not intended to stiffle player innovation, nor stop them doing things outside the basic blueprint of the adventure, merely to ensure that there is always a dangling thread to pick at, a clue to follow if they run out of leads.
<blockquote><br/>Interestingly, I'd be quite happy to play in a game, just not to run one. I want more mechanical tools to support me as a GM when I run a game. I'm lazy like that. </blockquote>
I'll pick up on this one up, too. GUMSHOE is one of the easiest systems to pick up and run as a GM that I've encountered, and Steve Dempsey has just said something similar.  It's tremendously freeing, whether you are running a prewritten adventure, or just improvising. The purchase of clues with resources really helps drive the game on, whether they are improvised clues (GM or player) or pre-written elements. At least, that's what we've found in playtesting.<br/><br/>Still even if you are happy just to play, I've got no complaints!                        </div>

                            Rich, <br/><br/>Some of what you say about investigation and story is true, or true enough for this conversation. However, it occurs to me that Esoterrorists is not really about making a story. It ain't a story telling system. It's a solve the mystery and blast the bad things with a machine gun game.                        </div>

I have a question.  Is the solution to the case at stake?  If it is, what is the process for failing to solve a case?  If it isn't, what is at stake during a case?<br/>

                            Brand,<br/><br/>Yeah, I hear you and you're right.  Like I said, it's not the game <i>I</i> wanted.  But I have to ask why a game that's not about story-telling uses phrases like "essential to forward narrative momentum"?  Even so, I accept and state clearly that his is not a bad game, just one I don't think is right for me.  One man's Primetime Adventures is another man's FATAL and all that.<br/><br/><sub>(not that I am comparing ET to FATAL in any way except that the person who wrote it has legs and eyes, I think the similarity ends there)</sub><br/><br/>Rob,<br/><br/>They have values.  You succeed as long as you have at least one point though.  You can spend points from each skills pool to get extra info.  So if you have 4 in Photography, you can find the photography related clue that you need.  But the GM can offer you extra stuff, tell you how many points from your Photography pool you need to spend to get the extra clue and you can decide if you want to spend that from your pool.<br/><br/>Because character creation requires players to buy at least one point in each of the investigative skills between them, you can guarantee that each clue is found (unless one of the PCs dies or whatever, but then that's another thing altogether).  So I was wondering "Hey, what the hell is the point having these skills at all?  Why not just state that the players find all the clues, wouldn't that be much simpler and basically the same thing.  But then I got to thinking that, actually, it gives some nice narrative cues to the players about the kind of things the characters ought to be looking into.  Because one of the problems with some games is how do I, the slightly overweight Sys Admin play a shit hot detective who has skills way beyond my ken?  So for example, with this system I just look at the Investigative skills I have and start reeling off processes I can try to use: "I'll use Forensic Entomology to see if the body has been moved" rather than the "I look for clues" mantra that some less imaginative players can sometimes slip into.<br/><br/>Which seems neat.                        </div>

                            If you have assigned points to an investigative skill, you can get any core clue associated with that skill, even if your pool is currently zero. If you want to discover something non-essential, or think of an interesting way to pick up a core clue other than the default method, you spend points. You don't have to spend them. Getting "non-essential" clues can make it easier further down the line; particularly if the clues give information which can help you with problems affecting General abilities (eg the number and nature of opponents you might face) <br/>
<br/>
A bunch of Cthulhu investigators might find the cultists using only core clues, but without the extra info they could have got, it's going to be much harder to defeat them.<br/>
<br/>
More skilled individuals can do stuff more often, but also have the option of major point spends. In one playtest game, two characters with Law cooperated to get a Federal judge to issue a warrant very quickly with a fun bunch of legalese, court room grandstanding and a 3-point Law spend. This wasn't required for the plot to progress, but who cares. <br/>
<br/>
There is nothing to say that by pursuing or following clues, you are necessarily "solving the case", but the narrative is definitely moving forward. You can pursue red herrings and be lead astray, have multiple ways of gaining the same core clues according to game pacing, go off and do whatever you like unrelated to any predesigned adventure. What you won't ever have is no leads somewhere.                        </div>

                            Hmm, the clue system sounds a lot like <i>Nobilis</i> then, where you have fixed attribute levels that determine proficiency (like having a given Investigative Skill) and then spend resource points to do things beyond your basic competency (like spending pool points for more info).  Props on using this type of karma + resource system.  I think they tend to work pretty well, in the same way that Fudge tries to preserve a regular degree of competency.                        </div>
