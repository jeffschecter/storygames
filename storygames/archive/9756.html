Thanks again for hosting us, that was a big job for a young family.  I ran Houses of the Blooded and got to play in a quick start oracle horror game.  There was a game of Red Box Hack going on in the othe room.  There may have been more gaming after we left but I had to drive back to Atlanta so I left early.  Fun was had by all  B-)  Very much looking forward to meeting up again at DragonCon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218165/#Comment_218165" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T20:41:29+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  8:41PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scott, it was great having you and your son with us. We all fell in love with Houses of the Blooded after you ran it for us. It's a great game, and you did a great job running it.<br/><br/>After you left Sylvia ran her first game (the Pool) with myself, Nathan and Ginnie playing. The Red Box Hack game went on until around 3am: that's around 11.5 hours straight gaming. It only ended because Jared G's wife called and made him come home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
