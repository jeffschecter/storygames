What's your target audience (what kind of people do you think would like your game)?<br/><br/>On the publishing end, the easiest route for publishing a PDF (for money, publishing it non-commercially is even easier) is probably getting some free webspace (like a Wordpress blog), slapping a Paypal button on it, and emailing copies to the people who buy it.

Anyone can sell a PDF, but it's hard to get attention for it.<br/>2. The standard Forge advice for selling your game is: get people playing it. Go to conventions and play it with people. <br/>3. You might consider selling a print copy, too. At the very least, you could publish it on Lulu.com, which is a print-on-demand service. You could also do a short print run: say, 50 or 100 copies.<br/>4. The places people often sell things are: Indie Press Revolution, RPG.NOW, Drive Thru RPG, <br/>5. Jonathan is also right that it's easy to set up a web page and do it yourself.<br/><br/>Other general things:<br/><br/>1. Post in the Publishing section of the Collective Endeavour. They will be all friendly and give you advice.<br/>2. The archives of the Forge and the Collective Endeavour are good resources for publishing.<br/>3.

Undortunately, you sort of forgot the fact that you were a star and its only just come back to you at the beginning of the game. Your starlight scattered when you fell, and is lost through time for you to go and find it. Once you've found it all, you can go home. But every time you fail to recover some, or you develop fascinations with people/objects/places, you become that little bit more tied to the mortal world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts been set up as a co-operative game that could get away without a GM, with the spotlight falling on one character per session, while the other players take on the roles of major NPCs. The players have a big part in setting the tone of how their part of the game is to be run, so hopefully you can cater to a group of fairly diverse tastes. Character creation is a group activity, because its important that everyone knows what people are hoping to get out of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's rule light and needs 2d6.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a very brief description, but covers the general gist of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186003/#Comment_186003" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T00:24:27+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 12:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Lynne,<br/><br/>Please do come over to the Collective Endeavour and tell us about your game.

If people are already looking for your game then they will often buy from your direct site, which maximizes profit and customer contact. You can get them looking by creating buzz (by running the game, or blogging about it, or sharing it on communities such as this), or by selling physical paper copies through places like IPR or at conventions (if you don't want to sell paper online).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186029/#Comment_186029" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T08:05:24+00:00" title="January  5, 2009  8:05AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2009 8:07AM by Graham.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip, sweetie, darling, you really are talking out of your arse on this one.<br/><br/>Story Games isn't always the <i>best</i> place for design or publishing advice, but there's nothing wrong with asking questions.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186050/#Comment_186050" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-05T11:17:12+00:00" title="January  5, 2009 11:17AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pay no attention to Filip, Lynne.

Yep, there's a variety of aggregators which, too, have their own forums. Use them all, pitch to them all, ask them all. You might find that one jewel of advice at RPG.net, even (OK, that's a stretch...).<br/><br/>Disregard the crotchety types here--they forget that it's REAL easy to hit the Back button, if one feels put upon by a thread's propriety. If you want to know, later, if something is OK for here, there's one "authority": Andy (that's his handle; use whisper in a new thread). It's HIS lawn. And he's pretty darned nice about letting the neighborhood kids play on it.
