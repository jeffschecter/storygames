In fact, I am calling it Destroy All Evil as a working title What needs to be in such an rpg? A light-hearted romp against evil? Strictly shock and awe gore fests? Moralistic tales? Iconic figures? Anything in particular "genre" wise absolutely have to be in there?<br/>\nAll in all, what would have to be in the game for you to even consider buying it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 2 -recap of what I am doing<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I am working on general rules, specific rules for determining when someone goes over the edge with handling cursed items and the actual items themselves. Eventually, classic foes needs to be addressed and I want to include iconic figures w/o breaking copyright. Organizations will be there but not consciously made from any particular TV show or movie. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to add a common thread to the characters. Specifically, everyone has had their vision readjusted and can "see" evil in its hidden forms. Right now, I am just looking at simplistic morality, good and evil are active forces in the world...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I won't ramble on unless somebody brings up a good point or has a question                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131476/#Comment_131476" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T19:42:57+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  7:42PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://luckylamb.blogspot.com/search/label/M%27Alice" rel="nofollow">I'm working on a game</a> loosely based on 70's and 80's horror flicks and ghost stories, mainly ones with evil children or dolls, like the <i>Omen</i>. <br/><br/>In addition to the fun and campy horror element in these films, they often have really interesting dynamics between characters, including the evil inanimate object. So I'm looking at what goes through Damian's mother's mind as she realizes her child is the antichrist, what does Damian do with this knowledge, how does this truth affect their relationship, particularly the power and authority dynamics between them, and who "owns" the real truth in the story.<br/><br/>I'm using bluffing mechanics to play out the power and authority dynamics, and players have 3 kinds of PC's to create: a doll/toy, children, and adults. The game is GM-less, but the doll character has some GM'ish responsibilities.<br/><br/>I really like the title Destroy All Evil. It's bold and a little campy. I think you've picked out some good themes to conentrate on and explore. I don't really think of 80's horror series as being particularly slashy and gorey. Lighthearted romps against evil works, especially with the title. I do think of moralistic tales when I think of 80's horror tv shows. Iconic figures, I'm not so sure. I think of Tales from the Crypt series, with the iconic Cryptmaster. Cool position for a GM, but I don't know how you could make playing that particular icon fun.<br/><br/><i>Small child emergency!

Additionally, I wanted to include a couple of opponent types which would reflect the Crypt Keeper and/or some of the famous slashers w/o violating copyright terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking of TV shows like friday the 13th: The series, Freddy's Nightmares, Tales from the dark side, Twilight Zone (they tried to revive in the 80s so I am taking it), Tales from the Crypt (in the 80s but 90s bleedover...again I am taking it), Monsters, etc. I chose them because of their episodic nature and ability to have different stories in them. For instance, one game could have someone used a cursed item to make money and the next could have a knife wielding maniac.   I thought about the teen slasher movies of the 80s and specifically I thought of the movie Fraility (i know it isn't in the 80s) because I rewatched it recently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131831/#Comment_131831" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T21:26:58+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  9:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the connection between those series and Frailty?<br/>Does it include Poltergeist the series? <br/>I for one loved Friday the 13th and would gladly play a game that can emulate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_131834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sean2099" title="sean2099"><img alt="sean2099" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sean2099">sean2099</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131834/#Comment_131834" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-29T21:53:02+00:00" title="February 29, 2008  9:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is a loose connection because I thought hey, someone could explain how they were given the mandate to Destroy all Evil and the pressures associated with it.
