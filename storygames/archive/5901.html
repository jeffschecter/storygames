I think.<br/><br/>It stirkes me that the Devil in Dust Devils could be replaced with a Secret Shame or Deadly Sin for the knights and court of Camelot.  Does the otherwise noble knight give into his Lust or Pride?  And how does that lead to the ultimate downfall of the kingdom?<br/><br/>Has there been any discussion about porting Dust Devils to the days of Arthur and Camelot?  A quick Google search this morning didn't yield me any satisfactory results.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132051/#Comment_132051" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T09:23:09+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  9:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey David,<br/><br/>A campaign scenario I've been toying with for years is based on the idea of viewing the crusades through the lens of Vietnam. That is, all the knights return from the crusades with dark secrets from life holding a city in the Holy Land: surreal drug experiences, the common practice of crusaders taking young "wives" from among the local population, horrific battles, terrorist-style retaliations by locals, etc. And these dark secrets the knights all know and share and protect would be a powerfully destabilizing force working beneath the surface of knightly society.<br/><br/>I'd been thinking of using the Prince Valiant rules for it. But maybe Dust Devils would be better...<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132054/#Comment_132054" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T09:45:55+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  9:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.

(Or of any war where the 'locals' have a vastly different and generally incomprehensible culture from the point of view of the soldiers.)  Maybe <i>that</i> is the Templar Secret that broke them away from the medieval Church and led to their eventual downfall:  There are sins you can't confess to someone who hasn't 'been there'.<br/><br/>This is eminently gameable territory. I can see Dust Devils working great for this, but the poker card mechanic would seem somehow jarring to me.  Too modern, I guess.  Although porting in Tarot cards might work, just for flavor.  The Tarok games for Tarot cards are all trick-taking games rather than hand-building games though, so they wouldn't work...  <br/><br/>On another tack:  How about Nathan Paoletta's 'carry. a game about war' for rules?<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132541/#Comment_132541" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T06:22:38+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  6:22AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DainXB</cite>Although porting in Tarot cards might work, just for flavor.

So be warned: The following is firmly in the category of brainstorming.<br/><br/>Why couldn't a trick-taking game replace poker?  Run everything the same up to the drawing of your hand - working with your devil gets you extra cards, working against loses you cards, etc. - then, instead of comparing your best poker hands, you play a quick five card round of trick-taking.  <br/><br/>The character who takes the most cards wins and the harm is equal to the difference in the number of tricks taken: Winner takes 5, loser takes 0 - 5 Harm; Winner takes 4, loser takes 1 - 3 Harm; Winner takes 3, loser takes 2 - 1 Harm.<br/><br/>I don't know how the probabilities would work out, but the idea still feels right by the light of morning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133305/#Comment_133305" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-07T13:31:10+00:00" title="March  7, 2008  1:31PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy shit, there are some hot ideas in this thread.<br/><br/>For some reason, the mixing of Dust Devils with Arthurian Lore makes me think of King's Gunslinger.

I am really just stuck on Traits - one option is to have the characters choose two elements of the "code of chivalry" that they are particularly aligned with.  <br/><br/>In my mental model, I am replacing the Devil with the choice of one of the Seven Deadly Sins, tenatively referred to as the character's Shame. Past and present remain the same - the history of recent warfare parrallels nicely and I see no need to mess with it.<br/><br/>The attributes are replaced with the Tarot suits, and instead of poker hands, you have a five-card hand to take tricks with.  <br/><br/>I am also considering tacking on a campaign character of "Camelot" that suffers when the player characters suffer.  Possibly having at the end of a session to play a hand against the number of cards equal to the total level of suffering encountered by the players during the session - I'm stick working through the specifics.<br/><br/>I welcome anyone to weigh in on these thoughts, particularly around the idea of traits.  I would also be interested in hearing from Matt on what he considers "fair use" of his intellectual property/game engine/etc.  I don't know if this would go any further than local use, but would like to know if advance what thoughts/guidelines Matt would have on me taking the idea beyond personal use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
