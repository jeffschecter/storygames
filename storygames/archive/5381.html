Future actions are a no-no but Mental Command is all about future actions, which is what the PCs negotiated.  I.E. "Go open the city gates for the enemy."   Meanwhile Community Man and Intimidating Others - "I'm intimidating you." - is that an action?  <br/><br/>I'm sure I handled one thing at least somewhat wrong:  "I'm convincing the horsemen to help the city" (the horsemen were just window dressing on an NPC, the NPC didn't oppose because one of the city's attackers cut off his arm but he was ready to run).  I made that a conflict between the Community Man character and the Warlord even though he wasn't actually there (but I figured the Warlord's influence mattered in the scene).  As a result of that the Warlord ended up taking his LAST point of injury, which he suggested was the horsemen galloping across the city with the Community Man and then trampling him.  That was kind of loony-toons, and I'd love advice on how I could have handled that differently.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120882/#Comment_120882" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T03:04:05+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  3:04AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the question of whether convincing someone is an action is a group one.

But it has been suggested that if you can bring something with enough significance on the line (to the characters) then you can make a verbal attack that is as potent as a physical one.<br/><br/>So "Help the city, we could do with it" is just talking. "Help the city, or my men will kill your daughter" could be a conflict worthy action. "Help the city and we will bribe you with the treasures of our temples" *might* be if your group feels it is justified.<br/><br/>That was my reading anyway                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120902/#Comment_120902" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T05:51:01+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  5:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno if the rules require that the action be physical.

All of them to PCs?<br/><br/>Negotiating future actions can sometimes work but usually doesn't. Negotiating an action <i>right now</i> usually works fine. "Go open the city gates" worked out, yeah?<br/><br/>"I'm intimidating you" is an action, sure. He's like looming over him, lowering his voice, repeating himself with barely-controlled rage, maybe shoving him around a little. (Best if you ask the player: "cool, what intimidating things are you doing?")<br/><br/>You don't roll dice for conflicts, you roll dice when someone takes action and someone else can and will try to stop them. If the warlord can and will try to stop the community man, for instance. If the warlord wasn't actually there, what was he doing to try to stop the community man? Establishing concretely who's where and what they're doing means that people will negotiate sensible consequences.<br/><br/>Helpful?

It was thus narrated up front as exhuberant prediction of effects not declaration of action.<br/><br/>If this is true, then Player can actually only get anything 'notable' via conflicts/concessions.  Player and/or GM should decide who would be the logical person to conflict with and where/when that would come up ~ this is really part of deciding what you want, "with whom could I have conflict giving me that".  The Player, all else failing, must narrate the influence-leader among cavalrymen who they are conflicting with.<br/><br/>In IIEE terms:  Player think of your intent and then an action you could narrate that another character would conflict with and how if winning you could get the effect you want in negoitation (or by not negotiating if dice elimination is your intent).  Then announce your initiation of that action, in a scene with that other character.  If they don't conflict, you execute action but only effect is the action on its face.  If they conflict, dice guide narration of execution and you may win and proceed to negotiate as you wanted.<br/><br/>Anything other than an action (no persuasion, no death, no attitudinal shift etc.) can only flow from negotiation and thus can only flow from a Scene with 2+ characters in conflict, or if it's death/character out from winning conflicts where there was no negotiation.<br/><br/>If there is no conflict, the PC gives rousing speech and nothing happens [unless see next line].  For the rousing speech to [be asured to] have an effect, there must have been a conflict.<br/><br/>The GM could decide some effects flow wherever they are logical, and don't advantage one player over another particularly without the other having chance to request a scene to prevent outcome [edit to add - and should not reward players trying to deny others logical effects by sitting out conflicts, if a player could conflict and doesn't then give the effect that logically flows from an action].<br/><br/>Rob (home with flu and not necessarily thinking clearly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120983/#Comment_120983" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T11:25:41+00:00" title="January 21, 2008 11:25AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>So when the PC said "I'm going to give a rousing speech and turn these traitorous cavalrymen back to the side of good!"  - should the NPCs have resisted somehow?

Should I have just said no?</blockquote>\nI didn't quite catch all of what was happening at that point (I used my death to return a phone call) but I think a perfect way to go is to it run as a battle for leadership of the cavalry. Since the champion was run through by the militia captain, and Yves lost his arm, it seems reasonable that the cavalry might have their doubts about their mutiny. So the mayor and one-arm have a conflict against each other, in the form of rousing speeches and convincing words, to prove who is better to lead the horsemen. Maybe it doesn't make a difference and someone ends up exhausted or injured, but I think the way negotiation was going, if the mayor had still won, it would have gone the same way.<br/><br/>Although, not every conflict needs to have rolls either.  It would have also been fine to have it go, after the Mayor's player stated her goal of making a convincing speech to turn the cavalry to defending the city, respond with "Okay, they do. No need to roll."  I recall that it started out as a conflict between the mayor and one-arm, so that I think was the only weird thing, but think of it that you, as Yves's controller, decided to negotiate that Yves lives but the cavalry joins the mayor.<br/><br/>As for intimidation, I think the only issue that I think can be worked out is more vetoing of improper abilities. I'm not sure the warlord should have been intimidating in our fight together (similiarly, I probably shouldn't have been able to use my spear to keep the demon out of the Mayor's head), but there were sometimes were I raised an eyebrow to what dice might have been selected for some actions. I think it worked out great, but I think there could have been some regular declaration of "I'm rolling my Covertly and With Violence" and such. Most of the time everyone was doing that, though, but once or twice I thought "Wait, what is this person rolling. Really?" in the middle of a conflict.<br/><br/>Really fun time, though. Thanks for running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120990/#Comment_120990" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T11:40:21+00:00" title="January 21, 2008 11:40AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>As for intimidation, I think the only issue that I think can be worked out is more vetoing of improper abilities.</blockquote>Yeah, I think this is the thing I want to ask Vincent about the most - should I be cautioning players against selecting abilities like "Intimidating" or "Terrifying presence"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121042/#Comment_121042" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T14:53:17+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2008 4:50PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The dice don't decide conflicts! Vincent already said this and it's so important. It's called "dice, action and consequences," remember.<br/><br/>You only ever use dice when someone takes action and someone else can and does try to stop them. So "I give a rousing speech to the cavalrymen!" Does anyone stop you? No? Okay. The person playing the cavalrymen (the GM) says how they respond to your speech, and what they do as a result. Do you want to stop that? Can you? If so, then we go to the dice.<br/><br/><b>You don't have to "win conflicts" for actions to stick or become true in Wicked.</b> You just take action and there it is in the fiction. If someone stands in your way, then you have dice and consequences. Otherwise, you just gave a rousing speech to the cavalrymen. How do they feel about that? Do they hate rousing speeches or something? Probably not. Probably now they're all fired up and on your side. If someone has an interest at stake that will be hurt by that response, then they better stop you from giving your speech. Or stop the cavlarymen from doing whatever they're fired-up to do. And so on.<br/><br/>Action and consequences. Does that help?<br/><br/>EDIT: I just thought of another way to put it. In Wicked, dice never answer the question, "But does it work?" You don't go, "I give a rousing speech," and then we roll "to see if that works." Not like that. The dice answer the question, "Do they stop you?" and then, "To what consequence?" If no one with an interest stands in your way, then yeah... the thing you do works. As V says in the book, you're not incompetent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121043/#Comment_121043" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T14:58:39+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I do a group NPC?

You could do the Cavalry captain (and give him a strength like "Cavalry Regiment"). But you have to ask yourself why. You don't need to invent an NPC on the fly just to "be adversity." Probably there's already plenty of adversity from your knot of conflicting interests, and the cavalrymen are part of the situation that someone is using to position herself favorably against an opponent.<br/><br/>Swaying the cavalrymen doesn't have to be a contest for it to matter and carry weight. If the cavlarymen don't have an interest in this chapter, and haven't been established at cross-purposes to the speech-maker, then they're not opposition. They're part of the fiction you're making.<br/><br/>It's hard to get out of the "everything is a conflict" mentality that so many Story Games have, and just let action flow to action and let things happen -- but it's good for the game. In our Wicked game at GenCon, I had a necromancer take action to raise all the dead from the cemetery and lead them to destroy every village in the valley, and since that didn't mess with anyone's best interests (or they weren't in a position to stop me), they all just nodded and said, "Yeah.

They aren't the outcomes in the fiction the other Players or NPC's care about if they weren't being opposed.<br/><br/>If no existing character has reason to oppose a PC's actions (at the time or requesting a later scene to do so because though they wanted to, in the fiction it was not logical to narrate them opposing at the time, they were not "able" as rules require), then GM dipping into well of "creating a new NPC from generic type" to oppose is likely a tactic to use sparingly as it seems a bit "out to get you'ish" to a Player on receiving end of that.  Page 4 indicates a character not already created as an NPC can come up in play but that should likely be at Player instigation, such as when the feeling of table is "gee, that seems lots to enter into fiction without some risk".<br/><br/>By later scene I mean the Warlord could come along and undertake an action to be intimidating and fearsome to cavalry, with hope of undoing the swaying, later even if it doesn't make sense to narrate them into the scene because in the fiction they're 50 miles away just at that moment.<br/><br/>(pause)<br/><br/>Is the use of "conflict" getting a bit fuzzy here?  I admit rocking back a bit when I see "there is no conflict", though not disagreeing with the specifics of what then follows.  What there isn't is stakes based play, dice determining what the effect of an action is - there is no 'conflict resolution' of that sort.  There are conflicting best interests, Players are advised to have their PC's go into conflict against others where they are strong in order to be recurring character etc., GM is advised to "play with conflict" etc., and more broadly there are conflicts over whether or not an action is interfered with successfully.  There is quite a bit of something called conflict.<br/><br/>(pause)<br/><br/>My question over "no dispute over an action so fine such and such follows" is more about scene economy.  If A has a scene doing whatever and announces an action that is going to be disputed, and when GM asks B, "so what were you doing at this time", the answer is "I was at cemetery raising an army of corpses from the dead.", and no one disputes this, okay you have an army of dead, if there was no conflict yet, should one continue with that Player, "okay what are you doing with your army of corpses?", pushing that to the point where there is an action that someone wants to interfere with?<br/><br/>In providing each player with "equal chances to move their agenda forward", "a move on the board" so to speak, should that be pushed onward until there's some sort of dispute about an action?  I would be inclined as GM to "come to the Player who hasn't been disputed yet" for next scene before "Players who have been disputed".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121076/#Comment_121076" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T16:49:45+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  4:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, yes, there are conflicts of interests, obviously.

I don't think they have to be in the same spot to resist.  If they don't negotiate to end the back and forth, they could continue when the crowd gets to wherever they were last directed, but someone is going to be injured or exhausted if they want to continue the fight.<br/><br/>But what I would do is tell Player B, "tough shit, if you wanted the Palace not to be burned down you should have said something when player A said 'I tell them to burn down the palace.'" Because when you say "I tell them to burn down the palace" and no one says "I'm not going to let that happen" then they burn down the palace.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
