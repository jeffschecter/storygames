We were to be the only players, and we were going to be a barbarian couple with an infant child (our son was just a little thing then).  The action all took place in a snow-swept landscape devoid of "civilization," and our characters were inspired in part by this piece of Frazetta artwork:<br/><br/><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="image" src="http://frankfrazetta.org/images/ffcolr12.jpg"/></div><br/><br/>The game didn't pan out particularly well \u2014 it died after two sessions, in fact \u2014 but I've always wanted to revisit those characters in some form or another.  Which brings me to today and a question I put to you fine SGers: how can I revive the premise while giving both of us an opportunity to play?  We don't have DM/GM/MC, so I guess it would have to be some form of cooperative, GM-less system, otherwise we'd be switching off all the time and wouldn't have an opportunity for our characters to interact freely <i>as PCs</i>, as opposed to PC and NPC.<br/><br/>What sort of stories are we talking about here?  Well, wilderness adventuring covers a lot of ground, with the elements and the wildlife posing serious threats \u2014 those wolves get big, as you can see \u2014 but there's always the danger of running across unfriendly tribes of rival barbarians, not to mention the odd expedition mounted by some civilized nation from warmer climes, aiming to conquer the wilds.  I don't see a whole lot of "monster"-type stuff going on and this wouldn't be an open-ended thing where the story just continues ad infinitum.  Maybe it would last until our hero and heroine establish themselves in this hostile world in a place relatively safe from danger where they can raise their child in peace.  Or maybe things might take a darker turn.  Who knows?  I'd like to find out.<br/><br/>Any suggestions as to how to handle this?  I'd like for there to be <i>some</i> kind of system in place, as opposed to just freeforming it.  It doesn't really matter if it's a heavily formalized system, just so long as it contains mechanisms for chance and (maybe) personal improvement, though the latter isn't wholly necessary.  Being able to fight is a plus, as those wolves aren't going to kill themselves.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364832/#Comment_364832" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T08:57:09+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  8:57AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.berengad.com/bh/" rel="nofollow">Beast Hunters</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364836/#Comment_364836" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T09:05:49+00:00" title="March  3, 2012  9:05AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does <i>Beast Hunters</i> do more than just let players hunt beasts?

In Beast Hunters, challenges are physical, social, or mental.  Players could probably play an entire game without physical challenges.  More likely, the GM could present physical challenges (hunting, fighting, chasing, surviving) that get resolved without dice rolls, if the GM accepts the hunter's solution due to the escalating nature of conflict resolution.  During character generation, the player identifies traits and assigns value to those traits.  The balance of values between physical, mental, and social, for those traits is a great way for the player to signal to the GM the type of game he or she desires.  Although also check out the errata at the Beast Hunters web page, <a href="http://www.berengad.com/bh/" rel="nofollow">version 1.5</a> because I know there are some tweaks to character generation.  <br/>Beast Hunters really seems appropriate to the artwork you posted.  I imagine that scene as being viewed from the second PC!  Start the game right there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364852/#Comment_364852" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-03T10:38:49+00:00" title="March  3, 2012 10:38AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Fisherman's Wife</i> and <i>S/lay w/ Me</i> sort of combine to form a twisted take on your concept.

I had most success with Archipelago 2009. We were playing PTA variant withoutnthe producer before that but Archipelago works better. Maybe it could be too freeform for you but the system works well in this setting. The system drives history and resolution through key mechanics. The phrases allow you to communicate with the other player to explore more deeply things that you are interested in or to tweak things that you are not sold on. The ownership of elements incentives attention and consistency on the world and background. The resolution cards discourages everything from being an automatic success and are almost always conditional leading to new developments.<br/><br/>One of the problems with gmless play is how tomdrive the story forward and Archipelago has the destiny points what address this very nicely. I had much better results when placing the destiny points as a question instead of a statement. This way you know where the story is going but you don't know how you are going to get there and what is going to ultimately happen.<br/><br/>You don't have to stat npcs what is a feature I always look for.<br/><br/>It seems to me that it would fit the type of play you are going for. <br/><br/>As a side note, I have the emulator but have not been able to put it to good use.<br/><br/>We just finished a game of Archipelago last night.

I have an idea of what I want \u2014 wilderness adventures, maybe a "monster" or two if it can be done semi-realistically, encounters with unfriendly natives \u2014 and a general length in mind of 10-12 sessions, but I didn't want to make plans that I couldn't complete with what systems are available.

They're a lot more streamlined than the five-year-old patched rules.<br/><br/>A large part of the game can be played cooperatively. I remember Brand and Mo playing it that way a long time ago. Where you'll have trouble is with maneuvers in conflicts. That's the "gamist" core of the game: someone else judges your fictional action, and if you disagree with their assessment, you can go to the dice instead (which is risky). This is actually why making this game completely competitive doesn't work (John Aegard made a great Star Wars hack a few years back, which we played once, and it had all sorts of cool stuff like making up resources on the spot as an action ("The X-Wings jump in! <i>X-Wings PO+4</i>"), but it became clear that the maneuver offers don't work in a competitive player-player relationship). Cooperatively it could work, but it could also be a source of tension. At the same time, without it, you're missing a critical link between fiction and mechanics. So you'd have to see how that goes; probably err on the side of making generous offers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365111/#Comment_365111" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T15:32:58+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  3:32PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>This is a bit offtopic.<br/><br/>Looking at that picture, one thing that interests me (as a designer) in this context is that if we're two players, playing the couple, it's in our interest to see the couple prevail, right?

Assume that the PCs are going to survive the wolf encounter, but how they survive--or what they have to do to survive--matters.  Perhaps a fight, demonstrating the dominance of the more martial character; or by trickery, demonstrating the intelligence of the other.  Or, perhaps the adults escape but are separated from the child, which might be in the interest of one of the characters if the child's lineage was in doubt.  <br/>I'm thinking of games like Bill's Ganakagok, where conflict resolution is designed to determine who wins narration rights for the Ganakagok tarot card.  But definitely it would seem that in a GM-less game with multiple PCs, the PCs may share a collective goal, but would need distinct personal goals to drive PC-PC interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365174/#Comment_365174" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T00:28:14+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 12:28AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 1:08AM by komradebob.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>This is a bit offtopic.<br/><br/>Looking at that picture, one thing that interests me (as a designer) in this context is that if we're two players, playing the couple, it's in our interest to see the couple prevail, right?

It's even what you do when you have sme kind of unspoken social agreement along the lines of "...But ultimately, the Baddies Lose and thd Goodies Win, probably at a harsrh and sacrificial cost of some kind".<br/><br/>Who adds that stuff? The people playing, because they go into it knowing that this is part of the fun of action-adventure.<br/><br/>Honestly, it's pretty much exactly the same as playing with action figures or dolls or just play pretend of your favorite characters as a kid and suggesting dangerous plights for them to get into, the only real difference being that you're willing to throw in a few randomizers or accept maybe that this time it really does end in disaster, because, well, that's kind of an interesting way for beloved characters to finish out their story this time too.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>To answer part of the question about who creates/adds whatever...<br/><br/>In practice, with this kind of play, one personcomes up with a vision of a setting, maybe a situation, and a couple of ideas for related stuff. Where they draw inspiration from could be anywhere, but they want to keep it kinda open ended, and not color everything in ahead of time.<br/><br/>They're the initiator, and they gift the folks they invite in with that rough vision.<br/><br/>If the invitees accept that gift, the gift they give in return is understanding and consuming that vision, then embroidering on it and really bringing it to life.<br/><br/>That's the exchange of wonder, and one of the best things they give back is comprehension and more importantly, cool/interesting, developable characters, and also development/embroidery of the core concept.<br/><br/>So who creates it? Whoever wants to, as long as it plays back and forth, respecting the earlier contribution and appreciating the gift that it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365255/#Comment_365255" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T10:13:06+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 10:13AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's what I meant by the "gambling" model.<br/><br/>If you have a solid system for engaging the adversity (one that creates its own challenge, like a puzzle to be solved or odds to be beaten), you can both create the adversity together ("I think it would be cool if we fought wolves in the forest!") and then set the level of that adversity ("Let's rate the wolves at a 9.

Then I remembered this:<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/largerthanlife.html" rel="nofollow">Larger Than Life</a></b><br/><br/>From the page:\n<blockquote><i>SO WHAT ARE THE PULPS?<br/><br/>It's spaceships, jungle lords, and Nazis. Lost cities, underwater adventure, and maybe even a hard-boiled detective or two.<br/><br/>It's about heroes moving from scene to scene at breakneck speed. Hot on the trail or maybe a step in front of the bad guys.<br/><br/>It's clever cliffhangers that leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>But mostly it's all about the story.<br/><br/>And that's what drives Larger Than Life. In LTL you step into the story and become a Larger Than Life Hero. LTL moves you from scene to scene each with a different challenge. Complete your challenge and move to the next scene. Fail and you're whisked down another road that leads to who knows where. But if you stick to it and if you're lucky you'll complete all the challenges and that'll get you what you wanted from the beginning, a shot at the "Big Bad".

I'm now running AW!<br/><br/>We've run several one-shots and two brief campaigns with it. It really encourages round the table creativity and zero prep.<br/>The biggest bit of advice I found was: when asking questions you can often phrase them in 2 ways, eg<br/>a) Do wolves attack us as we cross the valley?<br/>b) Do wolves avoid us as cross the valley?<br/>Because of the way it works a positive response to any question is usually more likely, hence which question do you ask, a or b, to avoid making the plot too predictable? The answer is - ask in the form that changes the story/break the status quo. Hence if the players were currently safe then you would ask question a above, if they were being pursued the it is b you ask.<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian" title="Malthusian"><img alt="Malthusian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian">Malthusian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374377/#Comment_374377" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T16:16:18+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  4:16PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The topic of this thread interests me as well.
