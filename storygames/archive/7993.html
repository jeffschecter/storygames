It sounds like some roles ideas, to me. And for different endings--I think you'd only get that from the survivor(s) having some kind of reveal. For instance, the Backstabber, if he or she is one of the surviving villagers after all wolves are lynched, wins and the other villagers lose. Or the Wolf Hunter: if the sole survivor versus a single remaining wolf (normally when the number of villagers equals the number of remaining wolves, the wolves win, as they "overrun the town") instead makes it a win for the villagers.<br/><br/>Thing about roles in WW: it can be very hard to really "play" the alternate roles, especially if they are secret (ex: Seer), because it's rare that you can reveal yourself and your importance or knowledge (Seer) without being eaten the next night. Thus, many information-gaining roles are, in themselves, really just suicide pair-offs (I die so that the last wolf will die... if the villagers listen to me). Add too many pair-offs, and you either need a lot more wolves or the game gets too easy. Protection roles, on the other hand, are easier to play (often designate who to protect at night, or self-protect) but generally can lead to stalemate (ex: Leather Jacket versus single last wolf = tie) or, again, make it too easy for the villagers.<br/><br/>Check it out here for roles: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game)#Variations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game)#Variations</a><br/><br/>But maybe I'm missing your general point--want to elaborate, give examples (other than cryptic ones above) or offer a sample of imagined play?

The key difficulty in doing this game is not so much in thinking up different powers, but in figuring out how to set up and fuel the sort of content that would be enjoyable.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough Werewolf is pretty commonly played as a sort of light-weight rpg, especially when it's played as a forum game. At least on the Finnish Boardgame Society forums the occasional Werewolf games are a source of great entertainment for both players and audience, and much energy is put into inventing settings, props (pictures, texts, etc. distributed by the GM) and characters even by people who've never done rpgs. I might even say, having played the game with the same people live, that the forum version naturally bends into a sort of lightweight forum rpg simply because of the slower pace, less data and less pressure for quick decision-making. Sure, the game is still very strategic and psychological, but a colorful character and entertaining death scene are valued in a way that wouldn't find space in a sleek face-to-face game.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, even the FtF variety of the game is actually pretty easy to drift into the roleplaying territory if you feel like it. I'm reminded of how I GMed the Cthulhu cultist version for a bunch of dance gamers (DDR enthusiasts) a couple of years ago, and narrative elements were certainly a big part of the excitement during the night. A couple of the first rounds were played normally, but as the GM of the game can pretty much narrate whatever he wants, I soon began inserting more and more Mythos lore into the narrations, which eventually led into the game morphing into a weird sort of quasi-campaign - as long as the villagers managed to squash the cultists, the next round would be set in the same village, except that the cult would be a different one each time, devoted to some other Old One or Outer God. And if the cultists should win, then the next round would be played in some larger place where the cult tries to expand after conquering the single village... basically there were no rules changes here, it was all in the narration, but that managed to develop a lot of extra value for the game, regardless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176725/#Comment_176725" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T14:43:06+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  2:43PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2008 6:46PM by Nathan_H.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The real root of the game is the weak uninformed majority versus a powerful informed minority.<br/>How would ya keep that same thing going with all the other wonkiness?<br/>I'd think the game would have to be played very differently if everyone playing had a different goal.<br/><br/>I've never played the Mountain Witch, but I'm thinking Secrets would be much like Fates.<br/>I'm not sure how that'd jive with the whole "killing a villager at night" thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176735/#Comment_176735" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T15:48:27+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  3:48PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The differences in goals could be details, and even minor subgames. Like, perhaps the village has a village elder guy whose job it is to conduct the voting procedure, and then there's a guy who is trying to become the village elder. This subgoal doesn't really override the larger goal of trying to survive the werewolf onslaught - the politically ambitious guy is still on the side of the majority, he just has an extra consideration driving him, one that might make him prone to accusing the village elder as a werewolf.<br/><br/>But really, a lot would have to depend on what you find as core value in Werewolf. It could go many ways. Perhaps taking the day-night cycle as a basis, running some other cycles on the side... too wide a topic to cover comprehensively in theory.<br/><br/>Actually, what you should do, Nathan? Have a game design competition about this. You'll get a ton of different approaches to how to make Werewolf a rpg.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176796/#Comment_176796" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T10:35:07+00:00" title="October 30, 2008 10:35AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would make for an interesting contest... but I think you'd want constraints of some kind. Maybe a two-parter, to combine recent subjects:<br/>1) Retheme - A prerequisite for a submission would be coming up with an under-used theme (I say under-used because there's so many themes "floated" out there but not fully developed--basically, no Cthulhu, Werewolves, or Mafia).<br/>2) Mechanical elements Drive Roleplay (Acting) - More than just gamist functions (i.e. I can win, I can help my team win, I can force other team losses), new "roleplaying" mechanics should drive people more into acting and story-building activities and, ideally, away from the zero-sum elements of "vanilla" Mafia play.<br/><br/>The second element, I feel, is key to making a contest that turns it into an "RPG." (Oh, boy... here we go.) Put another way, while YES it is a game in which one plays a role; the roles are only relevant in their functional capacity to drive to the zero-sum end and do not, perforce, support ongoing play (serial play with tacked-on story elements notwithstanding).<br/><br/>Just my thoughts. I think it's a cool idea--there's reason to expand upon the game, for more involved play (make it a "real" LARP). I even think there could be room for mechanics which increase efficacy as a reward for survival and stimulus to more-complex on-going play. But it's a fine line (as I said above) between tacking on roles in the hopes of finding acting and story, and rebuilding the basic game play and balances to bring that about as a direct, necessary result of in-game decisions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ozbot" title="ozbot"><img alt="ozbot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/nCTCPKSKDL4Z7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ozbot">ozbot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176842/#Comment_176842" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-30T20:11:18+00:00" title="October 30, 2008  8:11PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had started something I called "Trump-- a spy game" that featured Werewolf-style double agents that you could vote on at different times during the adventure.

Then you get a Telephone game element going: the dead have to whisper what they want to say to the medium--they CAN'T speak outloud or they're "banished to the nether realms"--and then the medium conveys it to the group. Or not. Or distorts it for his or her own gains. Hmmm... that has legs, actually. You have more than one player with the "medium" trait (or maybe everyone has it?) and there's a push-pull of truth and persuasion.<br/><br/>I think  an "RPG" extension to Mafia would definitely want ot use some variation on the Multiple Family rules (multiple factions, each of which kills, each of which wants to be sole survivors). So you get a three-way tension of factions going, with that, which can lead to alliance making and breaking.<br/><br/>One could encourage acting and story embellishment by having something like Fan Mail:<br/>* Everyone has one token.<br/>* If you really think someone RPed well--so well you'd like them to survive the game more easily--then you may give him or her your token.<br/>* Anyone killed for any reason may spend TWO tokens to "dodge the bullet":<br/>*- It's a case of mistaken identity in the night (their cousin from out of town was accidentally killed--make up a reason, as the surviving player) or...<br/>*- They make an impassioned plea for clemency during the day, swaying the lynch mob (the player MUST make a plea and really ham it up, to spend the two tokens).<br/><br/>I dig the background ideas, Paul, but I'd provide more player agency:<br/>* You hate Character X because...?<br/>* You want Character Y to...?<br/>* You adore Character Z because...?<br/><br/>have the players "aimed" at each other as above, but let them come up with the reasons why on the fly, in RP. You might even augment that by having a sort of relationship map, in the game rules, which provides a mechanism whereby each character has at least one reciprocated (but maybe not identical!) relationship with another. So, for a given game:<br/>* A and B must use each other for at least one background question.<br/>* B and C must also.<br/>* C and D must also.<br/>...<br/>* n and A must also.<br/><br/>So that actually works out that each character is aimed at TWO others. And, hell, let them choose the background type (hate, want, adore) for each one--some might hate two folks, others might hate one and adore another, some might adore each other (Lovers role, basically), etc. LOTS of grist, there. Don't even pre-determine the relationship type (but, by the rules, one MUST determine the pairings in advance). Rather, just make players write it on their character sheet/card when they decide upon it during play.<br/><br/>But to FUEL such background -&gt; story play, you need to provide some sort of reinforcement for engaging in it (other than Fan Mail above). So maybe you can get a new token (if you've given yours away) by revealing one of your relationship backgrounds AND forcing its target/object to reveal their reciprocal relationship, in front of at least one other player (who will be a witness when the GM is ask OOP to refresh the token). Hmm... but "so what?" Fine, you hate Bob and let it be know, so what?<br/><br/>Hmmm... OK so each relationship type above has to be modified.<br/>* You hate Character X because ____ but you won't anymore if (s)he ____.<br/>* You want Character Y to ____ and if (s)he does, you'll ____.<br/>* You adore Character Z because ____ but is (s)he doesn't reciprocate, you'll ____.<br/><br/>So that makes for the actual award, then--not revealing, but getting the second half (Part 2) of the thing to "go off." Thus, the reveal could be a part of it, or it might be hidden the whole game, until you show the GM that  you got Part 2 to go off.<br/><br/>This might be going somewhere--anyone want to take the Calvinball now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176902/#Comment_176902" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T11:58:30+00:00" title="October 31, 2008 11:58AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>What you're describing with the relationships and the r-map is exactly what I had in mind.<br/><br/>I don't really see the need for extra rewards and stuff like that for the RP, though. You're just playing Mafia, just with some character meat to help you to play.<br/><br/>I don't think you'd need to "award" people who roleplay: I mean, everyone's showing up at this party in costume, aren't they? I'd say they're already "in". Also, the relationships just give them ammunition to make their arguments for the voting--if you think so-and-so is a Mafia/Werewolf, and you know they stole something from someone else, reveal that and you might get a supporting vote!<br/><br/>I also like the idea of the "whispering ghosts". I like the idea that one player might say, "the spirits of the dead told me that Owen is a werewolf!" And then another player says, "He's lying! I also communed with the dead, and they told me Julie was the werewolf." Meanwhile, the player who had told them both that Jack was the werewolf sits there, grinding his teeth, because he's not allowed to speak out loud--he's just a ghost.<br/><br/>This has some implications, though:<br/><br/>Ghosts either cannot be allowed to see who is who (perhaps they also close their eyes during the Night), or they actually are still competing in the game, in which case they follow normal rules (villager ghosts keep their eyes shut during the night, werewolf ghosts can open theirs). Either the ghosts have to be just as much in the dark as the "living" players, or they have to be still "in the game"--so you win even if you're dead if your team wins the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177286/#Comment_177286" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T11:03:42+00:00" title="November  4, 2008 11:03AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the ghosts would have to wake and sleep as normal. Otherwise, a trusted ghost (known villager) could spill it on Day Two. ALTHOUGH... that makes for a good rule variant to go along with "no reveal on death/lynching." Then, only the wolves would be trusted, and only by the wolves.<br/><br/>Though I still like the idea of roles which have "minor victories" to coincide with the main one (wolf or village), or even "betrayer" roles which win if they're last man standing--makes for an interesting push-pull of wanting to help the village... to a point, after which you just want to survive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177330/#Comment_177330" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T20:42:40+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  8:42PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like most of the rule variants are focused around the villagers.<br/>What kind of power politics could be in place between the killers?<br/>Maybe it could be some kind of vote for who gets to kill, and who gets killed.  If the Werewolves get voted as the executioner that night they earn 'points' of some kind. They have some kind of internal competition, where if the weres win, the one with the most points WINS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177544/#Comment_177544" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T08:11:23+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  8:11AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, there's definitely a host of alternate roles and rule variants that impact the wolves/Mafia:<br/>* Mafia and Werewolves (AKA Multiple Families) - makes a three-way battle for the win.<br/>* Godfather (AKA Alpha Wolf) - The night killers are ranked, and only the highest ranking surviving night killer chooses who is killed.<br/>* Serial Killer (AKA Lone Wolf) - Night killer that doesn't kill with the Mafia. Wins if last player (this is sort of like the solo-villager-win roles  I suggest above).<br/>* Competing Mafia - They cooperate at night, but try to get each other lynched during the day (last man standing wins!).<br/>-----<br/>I still say that making it into an RPG requires more situations (relationships, win variations, factions) and some mechanical motivation to perform/act (i.e. characters).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
