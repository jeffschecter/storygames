                    Context first:  We are talking about Fast-Food Roleplaying here.  It gets cooked up quickly, you snarf it in a hurry, and then you go back to the counter and yell "More!  More!" and more is cooked up exactly the same way.  Check out <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1323&amp;page=1#Item_28" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> if that's not clear to you.<br/><br/>So you're about to create a world and characters for ... say ... an hour of self-contained roleplaying.  I think it's perfectly clear, in that context, that you won't choose to write up details about the arctic north unless you're planning to go there.  You won't make a character write-up for Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Story.  Your time should and will be focussed on the stuff you're actually going to <i>use</i>.  Everyone with me so far?<br/><br/>One further piece of context:  This is for a teenage angst crisis game, and so people <i>will</i> explicitly be writing up the emotional stuff that's troubling them.  Because we're going to use it in order to play, right?  Wouldn't do to not have ever mentioned it in the beginning.<br/><br/>Whew!  Context done.<br/><br/>So here's my question:  What should the game <i>require</i> of you if you want to, for instance, say "There's freaky witch-magic in this world"?<br/><br/>I have a theory that by the end of the game any such statement should be linked to something about the internal life of the characters.  If magic didn't become an issue for someone, somehow, then why on earth was it included in the first place?<br/><br/>Contrariwise, I think that by the end of the game any internal statement should be linked to something about the external life of the characters.  If your mopey, brooding angst didn't cause you to do something then why on earth was it included in the first place?<br/><br/>And then ... urgggh ... slowing down.<br/><br/>I have more thoughts.  Before I get to them, do people buy this overall theory?  Does it sound like I've got a decent grasp on the necessities of the small-social-footprint, Fast-Food model?                </div>

                            Tony, can you refine the idea of "small social footprint"?  Does that refer to the fact that you don't need to make a big social commitment to the game... you break it out on a whim, play it for a little while, and then put it away and forget it?                        </div>

                            Fred:  I've made <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1348&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">a thread</a> to explain/discuss the definition of social footprint.  It has nothing to do with whether you forget what happened in the game (there are games of Jungle Speed, for instance, whose events I will always remember).  It has everything to do with whether people can say "Okay, let's do something else now," without anyone feeling "But we haven't hit the payoff yet!"<br/><br/>Jason:  Heighten how?

                            Acccept what was offered and intensify, or change.  In that example it went from "this is a witchy place" to "this is a witchy place ... and I'm a witch".  This changes the status relationshp of the two characters, which intensifies and adds interest to the situation.                        </div>

                            Okay ... I agree that it's good to intensify.  I don't need convincing on that.  My interest is more in your third sentence than in your first.  In the first you're telling me "Make it more intense."

                            Tony, I'll let you in on a secret as far as the world creation stuff in the products I've worked on. It's a bait-and-switch. You set out to create "setting" but what you really end up creating is Situation.<br/><br/>Ideally, here's what you get out of it, whether it takes 30 seconds or 4 hours: Color that jazzes everyone &gt; a Situation that everyone cares about &gt; Characters based on that Color that plug into the Situation.                        </div>

                            Tony, I think you are carting-before-horseing.  Especially with the kind of set-up that you're trying to create, the story should be facilitating world creation, not the other way around.  It's easy to think of setting as a sort of 'foundation' for story, but this is pretty much untrue.  Setting is, at best, a pretext.  It's only there to take the things that the characters do and care about and knit them together enough that the audience will believe that they all exist in relative proximity.  There's only an Empire and an Emporer because Vader needed to have an evil master.  If Vader was a rogue agent of evil, Star Wars wouldn't have the Old Republic / Empire thing in its setting at all.<br/><br/>Since you are going for incredibly character-driven story, why can't you simply make 'world creation' a step that aggregates character traits and relates them?  To whit:<br/><br/><strong>Abdul</strong><br/>o Wants to Resurrect Dead Wife<br/>o Desperation<br/><br/><strong>Alice</strong><br/>o Royal Heritage<br/>o Mysterious Ass-kicking Powerz<br/><br/><strong>George</strong><br/>o Steam-Powered Mechanical Arm<br/>o Patriotic<br/><br/>And so your world needs necromancy, a kingdom (maybe a fallen kingdom), steampunk anachrotech, domestic tension (for Abdul's desperation), and international tension (for George's patriotism).<br/><br/>Relate those together to get something like: generations ago, the golden age collapsed as karmic retribution for necromantic abominations; the factionalized survivors built new nations atop the ruins, employing new technology to replace the lost magical infrastructure; the desperate times have created lean and mean societies with little regard for the needs or dreams of the individual.<br/><br/>And then play.<br/><br/>Or are you looking for something completely and totally different?                        </div>

You know those key chain things Jonathan, Shreyas and Thomas have been talking about? They are perfectly suited for making sure that later on you reincorporate the things you want at the center of the game, and use them to resolve conflict.                        </div>

                            Tony, how is a matter of implementation, I think. We do it by asking questions that lead to situation.<br/><br/>Joshua, I disagree, at least partially. Your method does work, at least for gamers. Sorcerer and Burning Wheel, among others, show that.<br/><br/>But I think it's much more natural to come up with this: An evil galactic empire is seeking to crush a rebellion. The empire has just created a weapon that can destroy whole planets at once. Who do you want to play?                        </div>

                            JBR:  Okay, time to move on to my "other thoughts."<br/><br/>Why do that in two phases?  Seriously?<br/><br/>Why say "Okay, we've got Abdul who wants to ressurect his dead wife, and Alice who has a royal heritage, and George who's patriotic ... <b>and now</b>, what goes along with those elements?"<br/><br/>Why not say, instead, "Okay ... let's toss out some potential issue-pairs.  Abdul can't find closuse with the death of his wife ... and this is a world with necromancy.  George is patriotic ... and his country may be the bad guys in their current war.  Princess Alice wants to prove herself worthy of her royal heritage ... and the power core of her ass-kicking NobleMech has been stolen."<br/><br/>I'm thinking that there should <i>never be a moment</i> in which any internal tension exists that isn't balanced with some external manifestation, and vice versa.<br/><br/>So you've tossed those out there in pairs.  All that means (unless you choose to make it mean something more) is that you've got the same number of internal issues and external issues.  Then you <i>play</i> and discover how they actually match up, and why.  For instance:  Princess Alice gives herself over to a haunting spirit of her famous warrior-princess ancestor, in order to prove her worth.  Abdul discovers that his wife was murdered because she learned too much about some dark mystic bargain made by the government, and he dedicates himself to finishing the quest she started.  George's patriotism gives him the strength to track down the thief and recover the power core of Alice's mecha.<br/><br/>Enemies are at the gates.  George returns with the power-core.  Abdul notices that the sigils on the power-core are the same as those on a dark temple he investigated following up rumors.  Alice, possessed by Nareeta-Sama, boards the mech and fights valiantly, saving the kingdom, at least for another day.  End of game.                        </div>

I think it's more intuitive, sure.  I don't, however, think that it's more reliable.  There's no guarantee that there is enough space for the number of characters you need, for instance.  Or on a related note, there's no guarantee that everybody at the table has something in that protosetting that they can get into.  There's nothing that guarantees that the individual characters will have individual conflicts that have any bearing on the greater world (how many traditional games start with a very similar Evil Empire set up and then the PCs just become cogs in the rebellion?).<br/><br/>It occurs to me that I should take a moment to disclaim a bit.  The above set up is built towards Tony's goal of fundamentally character-driven setting.  If you started there and got to actual play, it would be all about the characters and their impact on the setting.  It would not be about, for instance, exploring the setting or examining sociopolitical relationships that the PCs are not a part of.  So if your goals are different than Tony's, then yes, other methods may work better for your purposes.  I'm talking about charactercentric setting-creation.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Why do that in two phases?</blockquote>
You don't have to.  I've just separated out the personal-level and the group-level to make it clearer.  It could just as easily go:<br/><br/>George: I want to be all patriotic!<br/>Alice: Man, you can be my retainer, cause I want to be all regal, like a princess.<br/>Abdul: Screw that, man, I want to have a very personal motivation that pulls me away from big stuff like politics.  I know, I want to resurrect my dead wife, and I'm totally consumed by that.<br/>Alice: What, like necromancy?  That's some heavy stuff; maybe it's got some consequences attached?  I don't know if my kingdom would be all up for zombies and stuff.<br/>George: Yeah, my guy would go the other way, all technology and stuff.  Oh man, I could have a steam-powered arm!<br/>Alice: That would be cool, but I'm not saying that the kingdom is all anti-magic.  In fact, some nifty royal bloodline ass-kicking powerz would be pretty neat...<br/><br/>However, I do think that for the non-design-immersed player, doing everything all at once and making sure it's all balanced and functional at the same time is a bit of a tall order.  Identification with character and then relating character as two phases is probably a more straightforward procedure.  "Advanced" players will be thinking ahead as they build their intial characters anyway.<br/><br/>I also just noticed that you're building situation, not just setting, with your conflict-pairs thing.  Which I think is cool, and probably a necessary feature in your small-footprint design.  Especially if you're redesigning the characters at each go, the ensuing situation will be different, and play will be like a new episode or installment, and that's good stuff.                        </div>

I get that you're worried something will go wrong with non-design-immersed players, but I'm not sure what.  I agree that <i>freeform</i> asking them to make up a huge, balanced mess of character stuff is a tall order.  But it's not hard to say "Okay, make up two traits that highlight each other, one external, one internal," is it?<br/><br/>Is there a skill above and beyond "make up two traits" that you think is quietly operating behind the scenes?  If so, can you make up an example (like the one above) that uses the two-trait idea but fails at the hidden skill, so I can see it go wrong?                        </div>

That's why the situation is created collaboratively. Everyone needs to be excited about it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think that creating characters and only then looking for emergent situation is largely a gamerism. It's the way most games work. In fact, most games spend a lot of time explaining how to create a character, but little to no time explaining situation at all. The common formula is this:<br/><br/>1. Create Characters<br/>2. ??? (Some sort of unexplainable magic happens in which situation gets created--usually by the GM--and everybody knows how to do it, right?)<br/>3. Awesome game.<br/><br/>Creating situation and then finding characters that address that situation is much more understandable to the average person, I think. I also think it's probably the strongest method for creating character-focused play. It's also the best way of creating emergent, cohesive, thematic story, even if the main characters never interact.                        </div>

                            You know what, Tony, I think I was misreading you.<br/><br/>You asked 'why two phases' and I thought you were asking why I had players doing (a) creating character traits and then (b) relating them between each other.  You were, in fact, asking why creating character traits did not have prepackaged character conflict within them.  I don't think there'd be any problem whatsoever if the procedure was:<br/><br/>1) Create character traits that point directly at conflicts (George's patriotism, and he may be the bad guy in the war.)<br/>2) Relate those trait/conflicts together (George's maybe-bad guy nation is Alice's kingdom in need of a proper ruler)<br/><br/>Now, in the explanatory text, you might say that (1) can be done in two bits, (a) think of something you want (like 'patriotic') and then (b) find a way to complicate it (maybe we're the badguys), but that's details.<br/><br/>But you are right in that the quality of the traits that get created in (1) -- their 'punch' -- are going to directly determine the quality and 'grabbiness' of the setting/situation of (2).  Prepackaging conflict in (1) is a good call.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thor Olavsrud</cite>That's why the situation is created collaboratively. Everyone needs to be excited about it.</blockquote>
And I humbly suggest, Thor, that in the process of creating the situation collaboratively, the individual players are formulating characters concurrently.  When one says, "And there's a rebellion!" he's thinking about a rebel pilot, and when another one says, "And the Empire is corrupt and filled with criminals!" she's thinking of a rogueish smuggler.<br/><br/>I think the 'gamerism' involved is everyone at the table being way too used to roleplaying and its heretofore habit of creating everything wholecloth at the same time.  Human beings are complex things, and we can do a whole lot of stuff simultaneously.  It's just hard to extricate all those things afterwards to describe the processes that we actually followed.<br/><br/>Creating situation from characters or distilling characters from situation are two approaches. I don't think either is superior to the other, but I do think that their end products will look different and be appropriate for different games.  <em>Dogs</em> is characters to situation, and would be really weird if it went the other way.  <em>PTA</em> is situation to characters, and wouldn't work otherwise.                        </div>

                            Hrm.  Just thought something.  I'm not sure even <b>I</b> will believe it when I think about it harder, but here goes:<br/><br/>If internal Trait A has huge, engaging, scary potential to be in conflict with external Trait B, and internal Trait C has huge, engaging, scary potential to be in conflict with external Trait D then Trait A will also have huge potential to conflict with Trait D, and Trait C will also have huge potential to conflict with Trait B.<br/><br/>Which is to say, short-hand:  The quality that you create by making two traits that work together as a pair is independent of their pairing.  They are, individually, well-suited to connect with another trait.  I find it very funny that it is easier to make <b>two</b> traits that will be grabby no matter what they're paired with than it is to make <b>one</b>.<br/><br/>And, looking at it ... yeah, so far I still agree with myself.

Tony, I think you're wrong on this one in a general sense, though I do think that you can tell good stories this way.<br/><br/>The reason that you can have stuff that's not tied to characters either internally or externally and still be interesting is because the players are the audience.  The audience can interpret story-stuff based on things that are in the fiction, but not tied to the main characters/plot/whatever.<br/><br/>So, looking at the 'my wife is dead and I want to bring her back' thing.  It could be that we, as the audience, know that she's not <i>actually</i> dead.  This bit of knowledge isn't really a conflict for the character, he has no idea, and further we may know that he never will.  But it makes us reinterpret every action that the character takes because we know that every atrocity he chooses to commit in the pursuit of his goal is not worth doing.<br/><br/>I suppose you could say that a character's 'lack of knowledge' is an external conflict, but that doesn't seem quite right to me.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas:  My instinct is that what you're talking about is narrative color.  Yes, it has an impact.  Yes, it's worth doing.  But I don't think it is enough <i>on its own</i> to counterbalance a conflict.<br/><br/>So I could see "I can't get past my wife's death" balanced against "A temporal inversion is causing us my to relive the same day over and over" with "She's not really dead" as color.<br/><br/>Or I could see "I can't get past my wife's death" balanced against "A shadowy figure is manipulating me from behind the scenes" with "She's not really dead" as the outcome that links the two.<br/><br/>But I don't see "I can't get past my wife's death" making for good story on its own, with nothing to link it to the externals.

How do you resolve characters that introduce setting elements that are net negative for other players, even if they don't interfere directly with what those players want to do?                        </div>

                            Jason:  I don't have a perfect answer for that.  I have many imperfect answers, suited for specific game-purposes.  But in general?  No.  It's an issue worthy of concern.  Is the problem more inherent in "Let's match internal tensions with external tensions" than it is in "Let's make up some traits of our character"?<br/><br/>I mean ... I totally grant that it's an issue worth dealing with.  I'm trying to see whether it's part and parcel of these other issues we're talking about, or whether it's a thing of its own that interacts.                        </div>

                            JD, when I was getting ready to run my first con game of PTA, I ran across Judd's excellent advice on setting up con games of PTA.  The <em>very first question</em> is "What <em>don't</em> you want to have in the show?"  In many ways, I think that question is probably the most useful of the entire set.  If you can quickly and easily get unwanted stuff off the table, it's a thousand times easier to find a combination of wanted stuff that will work.                        </div>

                            Tony,<br><br>I concur that just a bunch of inert stuff is uninteresting.  The old 'show, don't tell' thing is playing in here.  If you just tell us that the character can't get over his wife's death, but he never does anything, well we probably don't believe you.<br/><br/>That said, I do think that you can have some amount of stuff that seems inert.  Stuff that never enters into the fictional construction of the game can be powerful.  Let's take my earlier example and get a bit more concrete.  Let's say that there's a character named Otto the Blacksmith.  Otto has good reason to believe his wife is dead.  He saw her murdered before his eyes and buried her himself.  But he can't live without her, so he goes about accumulating all sorts of necromantic knowledge and one of the things he has to do to get this knowledge is kill some innocent child.  Let's say he chooses, ultimately, that his wife is worth his humanity, and he kills the kid.  The story can <i>end right there</i> if we, as the audience, have a piece of knowledge that hasn't mattered to play: the wife is alive, her death was faked (for whatever reason).  It seems, at least to me, that the story is <i>more powerful</i> for the audience knowing that he tore himself up making that decision, and that it was completely unneccessary.<br/><br/>I also have a lot to say about your other idea (A, B, C, and D thing), but I'm going to hold off for now.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Which is to say, short-hand:  The quality that you create by making two traits that work together as a pair is independent of their pairing.  They are, individually, well-suited to connect with another trait.  I find it very funny that it is easier to make<b>two</b>traits that will be grabby no matter what they're paired with than it is to make<b>one</b>.<br/></blockquote>
It makes sense to me: if every character in the story is (say) brave, then no one will seem outstandingly brave, because there are no cowards (or sensible people) to compare to. For some characteristic to be visible, it needs to stand out through contrast. So if you know that you want X to be highlighted, you need something that's very different to provide it.                        </div>

                            Tony, I see this as pretty relevant to the topic, but I apologize if you see it as a hijacking.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite> <em>Dogs</em>is characters to situation, and would be really weird if it went the other way. <em>PTA</em>is situation to characters, and wouldn't work otherwise.</blockquote>
I think this might be the root of our disagreement. I don't think Dogs puts characters before situation at all.<br/><br/><em>Fallible and inexperienced adolescents are empowered and commanded to go among their communities to root out sin and judge sinners, healing their communities in the process.</em><br/><br/>That's the situation in Dogs as I see it. It's hardcoded into the game. No matter what the details of a game of Dogs, that situation will be front and center in every game you play. You have it long before you create characters. I believe that's one of the reasons that Dogs and PTA are such respected designs. When you have a strong grasp on situation like that, it's much easier to know what to <em>do</em> when you play the game.<br/><br/>The difference between the two games, as I see it, is that one makes a narrow situation the complete focus of its play, and the other is sneaky in that it uses a medium that is completely born of situation as the jumping off point to get a group to create its own situation.<br/><br/>I think we can learn a lot from both approaches.                        </div>

                            Thomas -- in any other medium, the only way that the audience knows that the wife is alive is if the wife appears in a scene somewhere.  In roleplaying, we can sort of skip that scene, but I don't see any really good reason to.  The moment that I know that the wife is alive, I have a thousand questions that I want to explore regarding that.  Leaving it in the 'did not make it to roleplay' pile skips all of those juicy questions.                        </div>

                            Thor, we may be coming down to a terminology divide.  What you just cited as situation I'd call premise.  To me, situation is "Jim's wife slept with Maria, and now Jim's out to kill Maria's father for letting it happen."  Situation, as far as I'm concerned, must be grounded in specifics.                        </div>

Are you leaving loose ends because you think it's going to improve the next game?

I'm still bitter about having to wait <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  (Oh, and those <i>Agora</i> logs, we'll pretend I'm still mad at you about those.)<br/><br/>To answer both you and Tony at once (cause I'm cool like that)...  We've got one session, let's say it's going to go for one hour (or about that).  We can only cram in so much story stuff during that time.  The unfortunate fact of life is that we can't do everything we want to do.<br/><br/>So, yeah, given world enough and time I'd want to explore all that stuff.  But, given the one hour that we've got to play, I'm going to find the core story more enjoyable (this is me personally) with the added knowledge that he doesn't have.  This is somewhat important for me, and it may be the source of confusion: I think that it's just fine if we don't resolve everything by the end of the story.  Unanswered questions are okay.<br/><br/>I guess my point in all of this is that it's just fine to intentionally create, as part of your setup of play, stuff that acts as context for your story, but that doesn't really act as content for that story.  Is that any clearer?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

Quibble: I didn't say answer, I said <em>address</em>.  Even the microscene that you presented with the wife tied up and watching -- that's a whole lot of address that would have been skipped if it wasn't included.  Simply knowing in some abstract sense that the wife is alive only compromises the addresses that <em>are</em> in the story, to my mind.

This is something that I'm quickly learning: if there's something that you actually want in the game, <em>shove it in there as soon as possible</em>.  If you didn't get around to getting into the game, you didn't really want it that much.  It sounds to me, Thomas, that you're actually more interested in the guy and what he'll do for the memory of his wife -- which is fine, that's a marvellous focus.  The possibility of whether the wife is alive or dead is actually completely irrelevant to that focus.  So for your game, dude, the wife being alive ended up on the editing room floor.  In your game, the wife isn't alive.  The wife isn't dead.  The wife is hanging out with Shroedinger's Cat in the Box of Stuff We Don't Care About.                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>It may very well be that you and I just approach fiction differently, but whether the wife is alive or dead <i>matters</i> to me in the end.  It matters because it changes the way I interpret the story.  In our hypothetical example it's not a big deal to me, I wouldn't fight with someone over it, but that doesn't mean it's not important.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm all about pushing exciting and powerful content into stories that we create.  I mean, to a significant degree that's what creating stories is all about.  But I do think that in our rush to do so we may be missing some awesome oppurtunities in creating context.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is the idea that the same story can be interpreted in different ways simply by looking at it in different lights.  The wife being alive is a way of changing perspective on the story, and by doing so we tell a story that <i>means something different</i> than it would have otherwise.  Maybe the differences aren't that big, but they're there, and they can be important.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Tony,<br/><br/>It highlights a non-obvious interpretation.  At least it's non-obvious for most people (I think).  It says, 'you thought that this was a story about obsession, and it is, but it's also a story about committing terrible sins in the pursuit of a goal that doesn't actually need to be pursued'.<br/><br/>Joshua,<br/><br/>I can try.  So, here's a slightly different example: our hypothetical play group consists of one person who is going through a messy divorce in real life.  As a result, any play that the group engages in around themes of love, commitment, and separation have extra resonance.  This may mean that our stories mean different things to us right now, in this specific social context, than they would have meant if we'd told them a year before.  Our context changes how we interpret things.<br/><br/>None of this is new or revolutionary.  I'm pretty sure that most people already get this.  So, here's me getting back to the point: the fictional context of the wife being alive, and <i>the fact that the audience knows this context</i>, allows you to tell a story that is about more than what it seems.  When Otto the Blacksmith kills the innocent child to obtain the knowledge to bring back his wife, not only may we judge him as right or wrong on the merits of the decision as he made it (thinking that this murder really was worth it considering his goal), but we also get a bit of engagement as we realize that he's thrown his humanity away for nothing.  It becomes suddenly more tragic.<br/><br/>And that tragedy is something that we-as-audience can appreciate simply on the merits of the added context.  Just the glimpse that the wife is alive is enough to allow us to recontextualize everything that Otto has done, and reinterpret the story.  Think of a story with a good surprise ending.  That twist at the end may or may not be very deep in terms of content, but that added bit of context changes everything.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

...but if the audience knows this context, it doesn't ever appear to be anything simpler than a man pusuing a needless goal at a terrible price.  Perhaps it's not so much that it lets you tell a story that is 'more than it seems' but that it lets you tell a story that has a multiplicity of interpretations?                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>At the risk of continuing to derail Tony's thread: sort of.  I think I'd rather say that it's a story interpreted on more than one level.  On the most basic level, which you get with or without any knowledge of the wife, you have a story about a man earnestly making powerful decisions about what different things are worth to him (in this case, his wife and his humanity).  That doesn't go away when the audience gets special knowledge because the audience also acknowledges that the character doesn't know.  His choices have just as much meaning either way.  But the added knowledge provides a sort of meta-understanding of the story that's layered on top of things.  That added layer comments on the layer below it, but doesn't overwhelm it, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>I'll try to work up a post on what I see as important about the content/context distinction sometime this week, since I think it's getting a bit away from Tony's original topic which I think deserves some more exploration.  I mean, it's a cool topic.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Joshua,<br/><br/>Quite right!  To remind anyone who's gotten bogged down in this flurry of stuff from me, Tony said:
<blockquote>Which is to say, short-hand: The quality that you create by making two traits that work together as a pair is independent of their pairing. They are, individually, well-suited to connect with another trait. I find it very funny that it is easier to make two traits that will be grabby no matter what they're paired with than it is to make one.</blockquote>
Which is to say two things, as I read it: first off is that a grabby trait is a grabby trait.  If you think that giant robots are cool, then you think that giant robots are cool.  If you think that giant robots are cool in conjunction with angsty teenage pilots, and you think that ninjas are cool in conjunction with fighting hard to improve themselves then you should <i>also</i> find giant robots with pilots fighting hard to improve themselves and ninjas who are angsty cool too.<br/><br/>This seems staright-up true.<br/><br/>Tony's second point is that it's easier to create grabby traits in pairs than singly.  At first I thought this was crazy talk, but I have since changed my mind.  The reason that this turns out to be true is that having two synergistic things makes it easier to sharpen each of them.  So I may think that giant robots are cool.  When I come up with a synergistic trait (such as angsty teenage pilots), I am forced to refine my idea of giant robots.  What is it about them that is cool that makes them go together well with angsty pilots?  This feeds back the other way, now that I've sharpened my idea of giant robots, what is it about angsty teenage pilots that is cool in that light?<br/><br/>So it's easier to create that second trait because I'm riffing off the first, but then that second trait makes me sharpen and improve the first to make it even better than it would have been.  That's dang cool.<br/><br/>Now, it's not clear that this means that creating paired traits like this is actually easier than creating just one trait, but it does seem that creating a pair is easier than creating two individuals.  And it's entirely possible that pairs just make for better traits, and that's cool.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Okay, I've just run a playtest of the new Misery Bubblegum rules, and the <b>absolute standout</b> thing that I noticed is that making a conflict always involve an External Tension and an Internal Tension makes it <i>dead easy</i> to narrate the outcome.<br/><br/>"Tracey and Kyle sneak into the producer's trailer and look around for evidence.  They win, and are not caught before finding the evidence.  The Issues at Stake are 'Kyle fears that his dad might be involved in something rotten' and 'Tracey returns to shake up Kyle's life.'  The conflict is resolving this way because of the interaction of these two elements with each other.  So, obviously, a guard comes in and Tracey grabs Kyle and kisses him, which is the perfect cover for what two teens were doing alone in a wagon they weren't supposed to be in, and while the guard is Aw-Shucksing they get away with some incriminating evidence."<br/><br/>It was like the External and Internal were two perpendicular lines, and the point where they met was always the exact target I needed to hit in that particular moment.  RPG Cross-hairs, baby ... it makes me happy to be a traditional "Describe all the outcomes" GM again, because it makes it easy and fun!<br/><br/>More to come, but I just wanted to convey some of my enthusiasm.
