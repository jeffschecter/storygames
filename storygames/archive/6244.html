Anybody interested in joining the meetup is certainly welcome (it's free so no worry, I'm paying the bill), but maybe we can at least get your regular Meetups at Pandemonium on the calendar so some of our members could join in ... how does that sound?<br/>\n<br/>\nChrsitian                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138449/#Comment_138449" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-06T21:20:30+00:00" title="April  6, 2008  9:20PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2008 9:23PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely!

SGBoston is an open play night where people bring one-shots to run and we split up into groups that are interested in playing them.  If 20 people show up and we only have games for 10 of them, the other 10 have to find something else to do, like playing board games.  Which is fine, but a little disappointing if you're there to play SOTC or something.  Because everyone at SGBoston has played Primetime Adventures at some point, that's often our default game if nothing else is happening, but that's harder if people aren't as familiar with it.<br/><br/>Folks definitely don't need to contact me, though.  If they're interested in regular attendance, they should join <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/sgboston/" rel="nofollow">our mailing list</a>, though, where we often talk about what we're going to play and get a sense of how many people are going to show up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
