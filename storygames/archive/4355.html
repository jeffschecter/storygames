In exploring the physical structure of the humble little cube, I discovered that the old standby is far more versatile than it gets credit for. I imagine the other members of the polyhedron family are similarly underestimated. <br/><br/>This thread is about using dice, any dice, as a tool for resolution. The catch is that you don't roll them to determine resolution. (Or maybe you can, but it's in addition to doing something else with them.) I'll kick things off:<br/><br/>The original one-roll engine has you roll a bunch of ten-sided dice, looking for matching numbers. The number of dice in a set is called "width" and their result is called the "height." <br/><br/>In this variant, you get six-sided dice equal to your stat+skill, but you don't roll them. Instead, you stack them up in a variety of configurations. The height and width of your structure takes the place of the height and width of your roll.<br/><br/>For example, say you got six dice. You could line them up in a horizontal row: Height 1, Width 6. You could stack them up in a giant, skinny tower: Height 6, Width 1. You could make a little triangle with three dice at the base, two on top of those and one at the peak: Height 3, Width 3.<br/><br/>If you want to do multiple actions, you can split the pool to create two structures. In the previous example, you could take four dice and make an L-shape: Height 3, Width 2. The remaining two dice could be stacked to form a short tower: Height 2, Width 1.<br/><br/>You can even go into the third dimension by adding dice to the front or back of your structure. Unfortunately ORE doesn't have "Depth" as a third axis of resolution so I dunno what it would determine. Maybe some kind of fallout mechanic? Anyhoo...<br/><br/>Your turn!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98280/#Comment_98280" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T06:49:26+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  6:49AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick question: Why would you build your 3/3 pyramid the way you've stated? Wouldn't the optimal structure always be an "L" shape, so with six dice you could build three across, then a tower of 3 on top, to get you Width 3, Height 4?<br/><br/>Unless there's some virtue to having a more stable structure, like the GM gets to chuck dice at your tower to mess it up.<br/><br/>Another oddball idea:<br/>Have a system sort of like Dread (the game that uses the Jenga tower), where you have to stack dice on your tower whenever you perform an action, and when the tower falls, you're dead. You could use different kinds of dice, maybe even keep five different towers for your d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20. Each one could represent a stat, so physical challenges mean adding a d6 to the pile, magic challenges mean adding a d20, etc. And there should be some way to cap a tower with a d4, maybe as a final "give it all you've got"  measure, after which you can't use that stat to overcome challenges any more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude" title="Consonant Dude"><img alt="Consonant Dude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/6858/fhjfhffblack2iv7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Consonant%20Dude">Consonant Dude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98283/#Comment_98283" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T07:26:47+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  7:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Your turn!</blockquote>\nWhen I started playing as a 9 years old, we would play in my bedroom. My room was rather small and lacked much in furniture, so I'd GM sitting on my bed, with the players around it. To roll dice, we would use the box from my Basic and Expert set. This allowed the dice to fall flat. <br/><br/>One day, I just decided to draw a few small circles and triangles in the box, with "magical symbols" inside them. Some symbols were chaotic, some were good. Whenever one of us rolled for a PC/NPC and the die touched the symbol, something happened, based on your alignment as well as a chart I had made. <br/><br/>It was quite lame as far as implementation, and quite ugly. But damn, did we have fun. <br/><br/>So yeah, WHERE the dice fall could be a data to take into consideration. <br/><br/>KEEPING some of the dice in your die pool could be another. As is giving some of your dice to allies.<br/><br/>Or how about trading dice? Suppose two guys are fighting.

Players build a dice 'pyramid' starting with base of 4 dice, then a layer of 3 dice, then 2, then 1; stating and action while placing each die.  <br/><br/>The player may choose any die to begin the pyramid, but before building with it roll the die and note the result.  The next die size the player uses must be the closest one to either the half or the double of the previous roll.  So, if the player started with a d6 and rolled a 6 he'd double the result to 12 and receive a d12 or half it to 3 and receive a d4.  He rolls this next die, saves the result, then adds the die to the base of the pyramid.  Construction continues on this way.  If the pyramid falls, the player loses.  <br/><br/>I imagine using this to resolve a situation where exhaustion and/or stress plays a factor.  If the PC attempts to scale a cliff and infiltrate the bad guy's secret lair, the player and the GM both take turns building a tower.  If the GM's tower falls first, the PC succeeds.  If the player's tower topples first, the PC fails.  Or if two PC's engage in duel--I suppose it'd work for a duel of swords or words.  If neither tower falls after using the ten dice, keep on building straight up.  <br/><br/>One will fall . . . eventually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98408/#Comment_98408" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T05:06:18+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  5:06AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Setting aside stacking, how about path-building?<br/><br/>A while back, Vincent Baker held a contest for indie rpg designers to design what he called "game-games." I believe one of the considerations for the contest was if the game-game had something to applicable to RPGs. The finalist ended up being one of my submissions, <a href="http://www.luchacabra.com/?p=35" rel="nofollow">Shannon</a>, named after my girlfriend who helped me develop it.<br/><br/>Thing is, I haven't figured out how the heck the game is applicable to RPGs. :P Here's the basic gist of the game.\n<blockquote>You have dark dice, your opponent has light dice. You and your opponent take turns rolling a six-sided die from your pool and placing it on the spaces of a 4x4 grid on a chess board.<br/><br/>If you place the die in a space horizontally or vertically adjacent to an opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s die, check the numbers on the two sides <i>that are facing each other</i>. (<b>Not</b> the numbers on top of the dice.) If your side-number is equal to or lower than your opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s side-number, nothing happens. If the side-number on your die is greater, your opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s die is converted to your color.<br/><br/>When the 4x4 area is filled, the players tally their scores. The light player's score is equal to the top-numbers of all her dice presently in <i>dark</i> spaces. The dark player's score is equal to the top-numbers of all her dice presently in the <i>light</i> spaces.</blockquote>\nSo let's say instead of a 4x4 grid that has to be filled, the dice make a path by adding the following restriction: Dice cannot be placed if they would be horizontally or vertically adjacent to more than two dice. The path of dice becomes this meandering snake, gradually growing towards one of four cardinal directions.<br/><br/>As TonyLB's been discussing lately, the "landmarks" in this system may choices rather than conflicts. Each choice represents a turn in the path. As a matter of fact, there may literally be landmarks placed on the board before play begins that some players would be motivated to move towards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98422/#Comment_98422" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T09:00:02+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  9:00AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One fun thing was in this Japanese sentai RPG that was part of a game anthology (TRPG Super Session Daikyouen).

In it, dice formations represent your units. They're made up of D6s. Say you've got a 1x2 infantry unit, that means it's one die wide and two dice long. When the battle starts, you roll the dice and then arrange them. So if you roll 3 and 6, your unit might look like this:<br/><br/>3<br/>6<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>6<br/>3<br/><br/>When someone's frontally attacking your unit, they have to meet or beat the sum of the line with a roll to kill it. So if their attack is 2D6, they'd have to roll a 9 or higher to kill that unit. But they could also flank: pick a row and roll against it. If you beat it, take away the row only. So it's easier, but takes two or more attacks to wear down and kill the unit. Then there's sniper units that target individual dice, meaning they almost certainly take them out, but only one die at a time.<br/><br/>Instead of attacking, the unit can regroup: reroll all leftover dice and arrange as you like within the confines of the original unit measurements.<br/><br/>Now, whether units can only frontally attack (ranged units) or also flank (ground units) or snipe, makes a bigger difference when you get to taking down those pesky 2x4 units that are near-impenetrable with frontal attacks. They could look like this:<br/><br/>3 5<br/>4 5<br/>1 4<br/>5 2<br/><br/>Heroes have a D10 in the center of a 3x3, with the D10 always set to 10. Heroes (and some other units) also have special abilities that can force rerolls, change die values, heal units, split units, and so on. You almost certainly need snipers, heroes, or other special units to wear down a hero.<br/><br/>The board this would be played on only has three areas: both sides' base, and the center area. Ranged units, while they can't flank, can shoot across. Ground units can only fight in the same field. You can't enter the enemy's base if they've got units in the center.<br/><br/>There were all sorts of additional campaign rules, with units costs, rolling the killed dice after the battle to see who was dead and who was only wounded and recovered (undead get higher chances at this), a map of battlefields, and so on. I sadly lost most of the rules in a HD crash, as well as the unit listings for the undead, the swarm, and the human/dragon alliance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98451/#Comment_98451" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T15:19:05+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  3:19PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2007 3:19PM by Joe Murphy.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inspired by a picture of Icehouses, I wrote a little zombie game. You played through player-led emotive kicker-laden scenes which triggered attack scenes, which were brutal and narravistly unfair. Zombies were d4s, humans were d6s and you used them as placeholders on a map aswell as for resolution. I've not found glow-in-the-dark dice, but they'd be perfect.<br/><br/>Inspired by Dread, a space marine game where tension was represented by stacks of d6 (big 24mm for wussies, 8mm for real men). Then, like Seadog Tuxedo's 'hold the ice in your hand' mechanic, the GM could purchase slams, and smack the table. Look for pairs of dice for fallout. Plus, punching the table for drama? Lovely.<br/><br/>How about <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2129" rel="nofollow">Crossbows &amp; Catapults</a>? Make a little wall of dice. Ping various sizes of dice through the wall, the distance past plus highest face meaning something?<br/><br/>Joe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98766/#Comment_98766" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T15:10:15+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  3:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: balthazar</cite><br/>Have a system sort of like Dread (the game that uses the Jenga tower), where you have to stack dice on your tower whenever you perform an action, and when the tower falls, you're dead. You could use different kinds of dice, maybe even keep five different towers for your d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20. Each one could represent a stat, so physical challenges mean adding a d6 to the pile, magic challenges mean adding a d20, etc. And there should be some way to cap a tower with a d4, maybe as a final "give it all you've got"  measure, after which you can't use that stat to overcome challenges any more.</blockquote>\nIn fact, in the appendix we suggest a dice-stacking method as a possible alternative, if you've got a fistful of dice, and no Jenga.<br/><br/>The rules for that one are: take 9 standard-sized d6, and layout a plus on a piece of paper. Remove the four that touch the middle die, and trace the remaining 5. Remove those dice, and label the middle square '5', and the other four squares 1-4. Now, whenever you want to do something, roll any die you want (d6, d10, d7, d24--whatever). If it comes up 1-5, it has to go on that tower. If it comes up 6 or higher, you can choose the tower. if a tower falls, you're out. By having 5 towers, the overall number of dice you're likely to be able to stack is in the ballpark of the number of blocks you're likley to be able to pull from a Jenga tower--but there is the added complexity of getting at that middle tower. And dice other than cubes are more likely to let you choose which tower, but they're less stable.<br/><br/>But i like the nuances you introduced: linking die sizes to action types. I think there could actually be something there for a game that was a bit crunchier than Dread. Something along the lines of Don't Rest Your Head, where different dice mean different things, maybe. So, rather than "it's physical, roll a d6", maybe "well, your d6 is the one you chose to stack, so you succeeded through physical means". Just thinking out loud, here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98776/#Comment_98776" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T16:20:22+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  4:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>For Vincent's Gamey Game thing, I created a little game called Godslaughter. In it, dice formations represent your units. They're made up of D6s. Say you've got a 1x2 infantry unit, that means it's one die wide and two dice long. When the battle starts, you roll the dice and then arrange them. </blockquote>\nThis is a cool idea, but I like combining it with <i>Shannon's</i> use of the sides of the dice, rather than the tops, and choosing which number is face up.  Because opposite sides of the dice always total seven, you're naturally faced with a tactical choice.  Do you put your six facing forward, knowing it will give you a one if you're flanked? Naturally you'd put your five on the outer edge of the group, but if the unit beside you was taken out, you'd be exposing a vulnerable two.  Putting the six uppermost would be an interesting move.  Perhaps the uppermost number has a game effect too?<br/><br/>Of course, d4s would be skirmishers, and they could be rolled.  D8s would be generals.  No one likes d10s.  They should just stay home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
