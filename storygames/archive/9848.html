I wasn't expecting much, but it was really good.<br/><br/>In particular, I liked the resolution system. Basically, the GM used the standard Traveller system: roll two dice, add modifiers, succeed with 8 or more. <br/><br/>But he used the roll to judge the degree of success. (Of course, this is a common thing in old-school games, but bear with me). A 7 wasn't a <i>fail</i>, so much as falling short of success. A 9 was a bare success. A 12 was superb. Roll a 4, however, and you knew bad things were going to happen.<br/><br/>So there was a degree of fudging. And yet it wasn't fudging. Perhaps drift is a better word. It was a wonderfully nuanced and useful system, adding a lot to the narrative. Every roll told us, not just success or failure, but <i>how</i> we succeeded or failed. It coloured our actions in a wonderful way. We didn't just hack the computer: we gained access to the main defence systems. Or we hacked the computer, but we only got 30 seconds before the security system kicked in.<br/><br/>Later, we played Lady Blackbird, but I liked the drifted Traveller resolution system better. I wonder if this is something we've lost in indie games? Aside from Inspectres, there are few* indie games that have such a nuanced success system. It's all succeed or fail. I'd prefer to have the subtlety of the old-school rolls.<br/><br/>Graham<br/><br/>* Don't list all the others for the sake of proving me wrong, although you might mention them if they do something interesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218865/#Comment_218865" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T17:54:46+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  5:54PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is one of the prime reasons I love Alternity. Part of character creation was to determine your total of attribute plus skill then divide it by two a couple times, with the space in-between the numbers being assigned "quality" values. So when you tried to roll under if you got between two lower numbers you would have an amazing success. The coolest part everything was assigned the descriptors from gear to kewl powers! Basically I do agree with you the subtle nudge of the older systems can really help kick start the imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218874/#Comment_218874" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T19:22:25+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  7:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2009 7:23PM by J_Walton.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're forgetting the Mountain Witch / Cold City / Hot War tradition of randomized degree of success, which is not an insignificant branch of indie design.<br/><br/>Also, Danger Patrol has both degrees of success (how many hits you do) and degrees of danger (how much danger the GM gets to pound you with).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218932/#Comment_218932" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T07:04:56+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  7:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2009 7:05AM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've had degrees of success, sure, but even where they're used, they seem such a blunt tool.<br/><br/>The Dying Earth RPG, for example, has levels of success that fit nicely with the genre: hairsbreadth successes, extraordinary success, calamitous failures. Inspectres does something similar, with the success levels fitting the genre: you succeed, but with a humorous effect. In the Traveller game, above, we were infiltrating a ship, and degree of failure affected whether we were discovered.<br/><br/>In most indie games, we rely on binary success/failure, or just degrees of success. I think there's more we could do, and there's much to learn from the fudging/drifting of old-school games.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218936/#Comment_218936" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T07:20:00+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  7:20AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2009 7:22AM by lachek.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, can you give us an example or two of games where the resolution system does not inform on degree of success, and where you've been particularly frustrated at its absence?

The system we played involves fudging, because a 7 is often counted as basically-a-success-with-a-disadvantage. You subdue the guard, but he shouts into his radio before you do. <br/><br/>It's drifted, because it's a change from the written rules.<br/><br/>Lachek, I can't think of a game where I've been frustrated by the binary success/fail.

I've been making a point of incorporating this stuff in my own play through the last couple of years - this can be seen in my Solar System text, which makes a big deal not of narration rights, but narrative interpretation of dicing results. In that game I basically incorporate degrees of both success and failure: if you succeed, you get the degree straight out of the dice; if you fail, the rules allow you to retry until you succeed, except that the GM throws shit at you for each failure. Makes for plenty of nuance.<br/><br/>The thing is, I find that many games replace this creative interpretation of the dice oracle with the narration right rules. (Both can't be used at the same time, really, as they control the exact same thing.) It's not a bad idea, it just provides a different source and dynamic for wacky ideas. The goal is the same: to provide for unexpected, nuanced consequences that inspire the game to go to different directions. It's important for a textured, interesting game world, whichever way you do it. (In Solar System I decided to include both options, because many people in the target audience absolutely love narration right trading; in my own games the Story Guide does all the narration.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218962/#Comment_218962" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T08:38:56+00:00" title="July 17, 2009  8:38AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must admit, Graham, I'm not sure where the concern is. All "indie" dice systems I can think of off the top of my head (IAWA, Burning X / Mouseguard, SotC, DRYH, Sorcerer / Donjon, etc) informs the table as to degree of success and can be explicitly drifted in exactly the same way as you describe with Traveller.<br/><br/>I <i>do</i> get the concern in games where, as Eero describes, someone with "narration rights" handle the function of determining success, the dice be damned. Primetime Adventures and Dust Devils seem to fall into this category, frex. The issue here is that the narrator's determination of the situation might not correspond to the table's interpretation of the randomized result, resulting sometimes in a kind of dissonance across the table. The benefits of this approach in these games seem to outweigh the concern though, for me at least.<br/><br/>Am I on track?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
