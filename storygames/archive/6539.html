I'd played an off-genre game at Dreamation, but this was otherwise our first attempt.  We stumbled over the rules in a few places, especially in the three-way conflicts, but muddled through and had a good time.  We\u2019re currently trying to reconcile some differences we see about the nature of conflict as described in the rules and as described by Vincent in forum posts - they seem to be very different in some instances.  I really enjoy the negotiation part of the game.  I\u2019m just not sure we played it as intended.<br/><br/>But my comment is more about face-stabbing.<br/><br/>There were two instances where my character, an honored emissary named Daol, was in a scene that started with dialogue but moved almost immediately to my adversaries launching themselves at my face with sharp, pointy objects.<br/><br/>Our group has become fairly adept at identifying scenes and actors that are likely to lead to entertaining play and likely to lead to conflict.<br/><br/>The first ISYITF scene was initiated by our GM, Colin.  My honored emissary, Daol, is interviewing youths as prospective candidates for a situation at a prestigious academy in the capital of the Thelan Empire.  His intent is to single out Tremellion, the twelve-year old \u201cChosen One\u201d who\u2019s prophesied to be a dangerous adversary someday.  He intends to separate him from his home, and ultimately to see him dead (orders from Emperor Adad).  Tremellion is being played by David.  Daol opens with some innocuous comments, Tremellion insults him but Daol pretends not to notice.  When Daol asks Tremellion to name the seven principles of metallurgy, Tremellion pulls a long metal hairpin from hiding, makes an awesome quip about its metallurgical properties and \u201cdrives it into Daol\u2019s eye.\u201d<br/><br/>I think the penultimate scene was arrived at by consensus.  We were getting close to winding up the evening/chapter.  The scholar Belleran is shackled to a pillar in the throne room.  He has been framed by the high priest Shahkam for the crime of assassinating King Melak.  Christian is playing Shahkam.  Daol wants to see the scholar ascend to the throne and has been using his network of spies for some months to spread rumors of the king\u2019s frailty and the scholar\u2019s worthiness of rule.  Shahkam gives a speech about the worthiness of the old gods, once forbidden, and that the crown should belong to him.  Daol has spies planted throughout the throne room, who are starting to shout things like, \u201cBelleran is innocent!\u201d  \u201cBelleran should lead us!\u201d  Daol starts to work the crowd and give his own speech about how Shahkam was the assassin (true), and how only through the scholarly leadership of Belleran and the friendship of the Thelan Empire can the kingdom of Goloqaat hope to prevail against its enemies.  Before I could make my statement that I knew Christian would object to strongly, leading to conflict, Shahkam drew his dagger and plunged it into Daol\u2019s face.<br/><br/>Both were situations where my character seemed to have the upper-hand narratively (scenes that suggested rushing up to a conflict), but in both scenes my character\u2019s opposition were able to make the conflict about whether Daol had a sharp object through his cranium, by stabbing him in the face before I made a noxious enough statement-of-intent.<br/><br/>So Daol and Shahkam are rolling around on the throne room floor and their players are negotiating back and forth as the dice and their decisions dictate.  This is pretty hilarious and improbable on reflection; they are in mortal struggle but having to whisper to each other about what each of them want for the negotiated outcome to make any sense.  Shahkam finally relents of his attack, lets Daol up and announces that a horrible mistake has been made, that Belleran is indeed innocent and should take the throne.  Daol makes a secret signal to his spy network who begin to shout things like, \u201cYes, Belleran our King!\u201d  \u201cDown with the monkey god, up with the gods of old as Shahkam has told us!\u201d  All per our negotiated outcome.<br/><br/>Please understand that all are having a good time, and no one feels like anyone\u2019s toes are being stepped on while they\u2019re being stabbed in the face (if you take my meaning).<br/><br/>I\u2019m just wondering whether we\u2019re rushing up to conflicts too quickly, and if we are, whether the rules as we understand them aren\u2019t *strongly* suggesting that be the mode?  And if we aren\u2019t, then is it an interesting feature or an interesting bug that characters that seem to be in a situation where they\u2019re headed towards a favorable end, can potentially so suddenly have things reversed on them, simply by the opposing character\u2019s player stabbing that character in the face?  Is that the rules, our group, or something else?  Have we missed the point of the game entirely?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145005/#Comment_145005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T21:45:41+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  9:45PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2008 9:46PM by nemomeme.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a further note, I\u2019ve read, and am re-reading <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26103.0" rel="nofollow">this</a> thread and am trying to absorb all its implications.  Right now I thinking we haven\u2019t yet played the game as intended, but had a good time anyway.  I\u2019ve read the rules several times and was aware, prior even to my game in January, of the prohibition against setting stakes, but it\u2019s difficult not to end in that mode while negotiating.  People I\u2019d spoken to at Dreamation who had played it once or twice were also not quite sure they\u2019d yet played it \u201cright.\u201d<br/><br/>Bottom line \u2013 if you\u2019re really only supposed to negotiate about the direct action taken by the first character, there\u2019s going to be a whole lot of face stabbin\u2019 going on without a paradigm shift in the way I, at least, understand the game.  Maybe fun, good time face stabbin\u2019, but face stabbin\u2019 nonetheless.<br/><br/>I\u2019m looking forward to our next chapter.  I just have a strong feeling we\u2019ll be playing \u201cIAWA Portland-style,\u201d and that there might be potentially as many styles out there as there are copies of IAWA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145010/#Comment_145010" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T23:23:48+00:00" title="May 19, 2008 11:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, first of all, that is true of all games printed everywhere on Earth, so yes, there are as many styles are there are copies. Actually there are probably a lot more. After all, we change the game every time we play it. And so do you.<br/><br/>Secondly, you are right in a way. If you are playing a sneaky, sleazy character, you had best be following up your sneaky, sleazy ploys with something like "and therefore, fooled, you throw your support behind me, Prince Bastard" so that they go "no, no no", assuming that you are truly invested in your sneaky, sleazy ploys and want to get to the conflict so you can hit the other players with sticks until they give in to your sneakiness and sleaziness.  If you are getting what you want without them saying "no, no, no", it's probably because your best interests don't sufficiently target them or theirs. <br/><br/>Another way to look at it is this.  I assume the reason they went for the physical attack is because they are not strong in the aspects that your fellow is strong in, and want to suddenly change the arena of conflict to something they are strong in. That's great, but it clearly marks them as <i>antagonists</i>, their names will not be on the owe list as much as yours, and this chapter is about your sneaky, sleazy fellow and his struggles with these knife-wielding maniacs who no one will ever care about again.<br/><br/>Yet even another way to look at it is this - if you're strong in your physical aspects, why should you wait for the sleazy guy to launch a conflict in an arena you can't easily compete in, why shouldn't you go for it as soon as you know what's at stake?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145027/#Comment_145027" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T06:59:57+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  6:59AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2008 7:00AM by jenskot.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last game we played, we followed the rules <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26103.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26188.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>. People were quick to escalate to violence. But we described the resulting negotiations or narration of the injuries and exhaustion in such a way that after 2 fights... people were very, very cautious and reluctant to fight again unless it was really worth it. Which was awesome. And that allowed for polite verbal exchanges with the subtext of fear that at any point, the stabbing may start again... and we don't want that yet, so we better listen! There was a village in China that my friend stayed at for 6 months. He commented to someone who grew up there that everyone was so extremely nice. The person commented... they have to be.

My character, Tremillion, was very weak in With Violence (d4) and very strong in Covertly (d12).  He had previously won a contest with Daol by which I learned Daol's secret plans for the Throne and for myself.  It was <i>not</i> in Tremillion's best interest to accompany Daol back to Thelas.  <br/><br/>If we engaged in verbal sparring, I may(?) have had the upper hand - at least from a die-size perspective - but if I lashed out with the eye-pokin' I was almost guaranteed to get onto the Owe List, which was my sole intention.  I actually expected to lose the physical struggle rather badly, but the dice gods intervened and I doubled Daol in round two.<br/><br/>I think part of the solution to avoid spontaneous gratuitous eye stabbage is to "circle the conflict" a bit more.

I agree completely with this.  I pushed conflict scenes pretty hard this time, mostly because I was enjoying seeing scenes where stuff actually *happened*, instead of people just buying rope like they do in all the traditional games I play in ;-)  That being said, I'm going to make a concious effort next time to do more scenes with people whose goals are not diametrically opposed, giving more room for a slower buildup.<br/><br/>The other thing is, getting exhausted or injured *hurts* mechanically. I don't mean gouged out eyes and chopped necks., I mean loss of dice, dice which you don't have that many to start with, dice that don't come back until the end of the chapter and affect all future conflicts.  I'm thinking if we're more concious of that going forward people will be more hesitant to jump into a conflict (except at the chance of getting on the "we owe" list as we saw above), and will be more willing to dance around the issue and sip some tea unless it's with a mortal enemy.<br/><br/>Still, those were some awesome conflicts <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145164/#Comment_145164" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T15:01:25+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  3:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2008 3:03PM by Maedhros.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>The only thing I can think of is that you can have violence without having to-the-death stabfests...</blockquote>\nWell, Tremillion is not a nice guy - he came within a hair's breadth of flaying his wetnurse alive...<br/><br/>The ongoing story is shaping up to be a running struggle (through Time and Space) between Tremillion, the Chosen One and Shakham, High Priest of the Forbidden God.

It's only when the action is something that someone else with dice, be it PC or NPC, is around and doesn't want it to happen that we roll.<br/><br/>Say Daol wasn't around in that scene, of *course* Shakham (SHAKHAAAAM!) could sway the crowd, he's the high priest of Goloqaat!  Or the reverse with only Daol around, of *course* Daol could sway the crowd, he's a respected emmisary from the Thalen empire *and* he's got spies hidden throughout the crowd to praise his name.<br/><br/>It's when they're both around and one doesn't want the other to succeed that we go to dice.<br/><br/>Cases of one PC directly trying to persuade another would seem to break down into one of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Character A offers some attractive deal to Character B, probably something that lets him achieve his character's best interest. The players agree. Negotiation concludes without dice.</li>\n<li>Player A says "I persuade character B to (do disagreeable thing), and *he does it*" (per JDs explanation above), but Player B doesn't like this and they go to dice.  Player B may end up doing whatever it is he didn't want to do, just to avoid getting exhausted or injured, or he may choose to get exhausted or injured and not do the thing.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, if I'm processing this right, saying that you persuade someone is fine, and it will work against inconsequential people, but you can never *make* an PC/NPC *do* something if the person running them would rather that they die than do it.  Which is ok with me, it makes things clearer in some ways.<br/><br/>Making sense, or crazy moon language?<br/><br/>(And, I agree with Christian that this has been: 1) really fun, 2) much harder than it looked on paper)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145404/#Comment_145404" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T01:01:12+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  1:01AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 1:07AM by noclue.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you have it pretty good Colin.

There is an implicit setting-of-stakes in your example:  "If I win, you give me the milkshake."  We play out three rounds of conflict, and at the end we negotiate the result - "Hand over the milkshake, or become Injured/Exhausted."<br/><br/>In a IAWA thread on the Forge forums, Vincent cautions against setting stakes and states unequivocally that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> stakes in the conflict are the consequences - Injury/Exhaustion (and/or a negotiated alternative).  Everything else follows the narrative:<br/><br/>Me:  I convince you to give me your milkshake.<br/><br/>You:  Like hell! It's pure creamy goodness!<br/><br/>[Conflict Round One:  I gain advantage]<br/><br/>Me:  I shame you for your selfishness, and you sheepishly hand over the milkshake.  Grinning, I start to slurp it down...<br/><br/>You:  [shakes fist]<br/><br/>[Conflict Round Two:  You steal advantage]<br/><br/>You:  Ha Ha!  I smack your elbow, so the milkshake spills all over your new silk shirt.  If I can't have the milkshake, NO ONE CAN!<br/><br/>Me:  Aaargh!<br/><br/>[Conflict Round Three:  You win]<br/><br/>You:  Your clothes are ruined, and you are Humiliated!  Take a die size off of "For Others" and "With Love."  <br/><br/>Me:  Curse you!  I will avenge the milkshake!  But I'll take my lumps...<br/><br/>It's unclear from the rules-as-written, but quite clear from Vincent's posts on the matter, that actions resolve in the middle of conflicts rather than being suspended until the end.  At least it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seems</span> clear...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145506/#Comment_145506" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T12:55:51+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 12:55PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 12:59PM by lumpley.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A big piece of this confusion is confusion between actions and intended consequences.

Is that right?  How would you handle situations like: <br/><br/>Me:  "Even though we're rivals, after sharing an evening of feasting and debauchery your surprised to find that you actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">like</span> me."<br/><br/>You:  "Oh really, how?"<br/><br/>Me:  "I regale you with tales of my childhood in Xarn - which I know is your homeland - and cause you to hearken back to the sunny days of your own youth."<br/><br/>You:  "No you don't!  My youth was horrible - dad beat me every night and mom ran away when I was two!"<br/><br/>In this case, my "action" is evoking feelings of friendship via shared nostalgia for the homeland.  You are resisting this, because your childhood was rotten.  In this case, the dice are going to decide how you feel.  Is that fair?  Or do you have to punch me in the throat to start a conflict?  <br/><br/>Or, more to the point of the OP:  how can we play out other types of conflict (intimidation, intrigue, seduction, etc.) if the target can always stab someone in the face to avoid it (and automatically take the conflict into the target's area of expertise)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145513/#Comment_145513" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T13:55:18+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  1:55PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like this thread got going.

It'll kill your game. You have to really genuinely not set stakes, too; it's not enough to not formally set stakes, or not all the way set stakes, or whatever. No setting stakes, even in your secret heart. So:<br/><br/>- From now on, in every action sequence, have the first round fully resolve the initial action. Here's how this might look:<br/><br/>Me: I run down the pier and I cut the anchor rope.<br/>Mitch: I stop you.<br/>We roll initiative. I win.<br/>Me: So yeah.<br/>Mitch rolls to answer and wins the advantage.<br/>Mitch: Okay, you cut the rope, twang! I don't reach you in time to stop you.

My thinking was more along the lines of the players only being able to declare concrete, physical actions.  So, you never say "I seduce you" in the first place.  You simply make it a rule that you can't narrate that any more than you narrate someone's head suddenly exploding - unless you have head-explody powers which is a whole other ball of wax. <br/><br/>I did say, "hitting them with the stick until they agree to it" which if we use Vincent's model breaks down.  I guess my point is you never introduce seduction or persuasion or other personal stuff except as an opening or a challenge, only as something negotiated in the consequences.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>A: "Give me the key"<br/><br/>B: "No" (it's not in his best interest to do so)<br/><br/>A: "Grrrr, I grab it (or pickpocket it, or bribe your maid into stealing it, whatever, something direct and physical)"<br/><br/>B: "Oh no you don't"<br/><br/>Conflict occurs, A's action might occur, or be blunted, or something.  Let's assume A wins, but they didn't get the key back due to the order of challenges and answers.  We enter negotiation.<br/><br/>A: "Look, you're down on dice and I'm going to exhaust/injure you if you don't give it to me.  How about after our brief struggle I appear to give in, but then I seduce you and steal it while you're sleeping?"<br/><br/>B: "OK" (or "No way!" at which point whoever has the key is probably going to start another conflict)<br/><br/>Which leads us back to a game where all conflicts start with people punching each other in the throat. *sigh* Now I'm confused too.

I come no to praise Melak, but to bury him..."<br/><br/>Shakham: I stab you in the face!<br/><br/>Daol:  No you don't.<br/><br/>[Round One:  Daol wins initiative]<br/><br/>Daol:  You take a step forward, but my bodyguards glare menacingly at you and you hesitate.

The crowd starts chanting "BELL-E-RAN!  BELL-E-RAN!  BELL-E-RAN!"<br/><br/>This is the "initial action" and, following Vincent's advice, it should be fully resolved after Round One.  Shakham's face-stabbing has been preempted by Daol winning the initiative and declaring his speech to the court as the action to be contested. If Daol gains the advantage in Round One, the action is resolved; the speech is given. Now Shakham must deal with the crowd by countering Daol's argument.  <b>If Shakham goes all face-stabby in Round Two, the crowd will remain all pumped up for Belleran - Daol will "win" his intent, even though his face may pay for it.</b>  The key is narrating the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effect</span> of the speech, thus prompting a proper response from Shakham to contest the effect.<br/><br/>Does that make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145555/#Comment_145555" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T18:04:57+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  6:04PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 9:08PM by noclue.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Maedhros</cite>This points up the confusion I (we?) have with conflict resolution.<br/><br/>We played it the way you describe above.

I think we'll do better next time.  Indeed, I think we should try using Vincent's recommendation of settling stuff in the first round of dicing once or twice next time we play, along with the other recommendations he made (about adding details and color, etc).<br/><br/>Since you don't get to pick what dice your opposition is using (although circumstances may dictate it), and since you roll initiative anyway, there's no huge tactical advantage for being the first person to say something outrageous.  Thus, Shakham could have said "Whipped into a frenzy by my words, the crowd tears you apart!", or Daol could have said "My bodyguards step forward and throw you down from the steps", or anything.  Thus, no real need for constant face-stabbing going forward.<br/><br/>Face-stabbing did seem to be in Shakham's idiom in this case, though <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145684/#Comment_145684" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T10:21:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 10:21AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Seduction is not an action.

One more question, and I think I've got it nailed.<br/><br/>Am I correct in my assumption that you <i>can</i> sway "extras" (or whatever you want to call NPCs who don't have character sheets and dice) without any kind of dicing?  So, since our characters are considered to be competent at most things, if mine is a "great leader" type can I say something like "I whip the crowd into a frenzy and they seize you and tear you limb from limb", or "I convince your maidservant to pour poison into your drink" or somesuch?  Of course, the PC/NPC torn apart or poisoned will lilkely say "No way!" and go to dice, but my point is that the extras are like tables or knives or tapestries...props to be used by PCs and NPCs.<br/><br/>Am I on track?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145890/#Comment_145890" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T17:39:50+00:00" title="May 24, 2008  5:39PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin, right on.<br/><br/>Here's a fun little exchange between me and Ryan on the subject: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26177.0" rel="nofollow">Proxy dicing</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146047/#Comment_146047" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T15:03:33+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  3:03PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not that I'd necessarily wish to, but could David or I, for example, play the character that Christian created (Shakhma) at some point in the future?<br/><br/>As he was at the top of the Owe list, Shakhma is the only character that we absolutely know will appear in the next chapter.

The character who tops the Owe list is automatically included.  The rules seem to presume that the character will be played by the player who played him or her during the current Chapter.<br/><br/>When buying a character into a Chapter by striking a name off the Owe list, a strict reading of the text implies that the player of a character chooses an entry of that character's name on the Owe list to strike, and that character is then included in the next Chapter.  (This is different from striking a name to get a bonus die -- strict reading of <i>that</i> text implies that you can strike the name of any of your characters in order to get a die for your current character.)<br/><br/>The third way to bring back a character is to identify a new Oracle element as a previously-existing character (probably accepting some random Oracular development of the character in order to bring him or her back into play).  The text strongly implies that only the player who played the character originally is allowed to bring the character back in this way.<br/><br/>All that being said, it appears to be a fairly common rules-drift to allow some flexibility with those rules, particularly from groups that have a lot of indie-gaming experience, and may not feel the strong ties of character-ownership that many trad-gaming groups do:  <br/><br/>If the player of the recurring character will be absent from the next session, some groups go down the list until they find a character who's player will be present, and go forward from there, leaving the skipped names for later sessions.  Some groups give a characters original player 'first dibs' on playing the character, but if they choose not to, the character is up for grabs.  (This may become problematic when a character shifts back-and-forth between being a PC and being a GM-run NPC, especially after Chapter 3 when the GM position can rotate, but anybody drifting the rules this way should be able to figure out how to handle it.)  <br/><br/>Hope this clarifies things, a bit.<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146064/#Comment_146064" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T17:42:08+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  5:42PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even all these rules discussions aside, I am SO looking forward to continuing our game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146066/#Comment_146066" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T17:51:18+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  5:51PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dain's readings are correct, top to bottom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw" title="Tablesaw"><img alt="Tablesaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw">Tablesaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146107/#Comment_146107" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T04:36:01+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  4:36AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>How about this. We all have absolute and unique say over the insides of our own characters' heads. Nobody else can dictate to us, under any circumstances, what our characters think, feel, want, intend.</blockquote>I've just begun playing <cite>IAWA</cite>, and I already enjoy it, but I've been feeling some weirdness about how social situations are handled by the game, and your statement, I think, sums up the problem.<br/><br/>We like to think that we have absolute and unique say over our own heads, but the truth is otherwise. Our emotions swell up unbidden in reaction to the world around us, and we are swayed and persuaded by others' words. Sometimes we do things against our own best interests, and sometimes we will even rationalize our actions afterward as being entirely our own ideas. Communication can be used, even without deceit or the threat of force, to change our minds without us realizing it.<br/><br/>Having that kind of control over our <em>characters'</em> heads, then, presents a problem. It means that our characters can't be goaded or convinced of anything we don't want them to. Which makes their hearts, minds, and souls far safer than their bodies, which can be threatened with injury much more directly. Words are weapons because of the way they make us act in spite of ourselves.<br/><br/>In a game I played this weekend, I fell victim to this problem. One character was goading me into foolish action using fairly reasonable tactics, but I was used the inviolable mind of the character to choose resonses that were reasonable but other than her intent. A thumbnail recreation of the scene. The prince and princess are in a functionally private conversation, and the kennel has become a deathtrap. The princess wants the prince to go there and be trapped in death:\n<blockquote>GM: She says, "You are a coward."<br/>Me: "A woman knows nothing of honor <i>or</i> cowardice."<br/>GM: "I know that a woman would not fear the kennel." <br/>Me: "A prince does not deign to spend time with dogs."<br/>[Etc., etc.]<br/>GM: You are so enraged that you get up and rush to the kennel.<br/>Me: Hell no.</blockquote>She was clearly using her words as weapons, but I hid behind my control over my character's emotions to deflect those weapons (or, more accurately, to deny that the weapons even existed at all). <br/><br/>Strangely, I think my biggest problem with narrating "You are so enraged that you leave the banquet hall and rush to the kennel" is not that it is impossible (it is not), but that it is bad storytelling. It just sounds terrible; that kind of thing never gets said in stories because the author just starts describing a character with a changed mind. But it's a player's call to the game for help with the story. It's a player saying, "What I want can only be handled by us as authors, so I'm going to risk my character in the story to put your character in similar jeopardy, in the hopes that I'll be able to negotiate that your character is persuaded." Because we aren't setting stakes, the characters' conversation may instead turn to previously unexpected but very dangerous places in the struggle.<br/><br/>I guess that one way is to make sure players know to narrate emotions in other players' characters. This may be counterintuitive, but it's more like the way the world works, where we can't control whether we feel emotions, but we can choose how to react when feeling them. So a player can narrate, "She says, 'You are a coward,' and you are filled with rage." I might say no, because I don't want my character filled with rage, or I might say okay, and continue my own narration having accepted that my character is filled with rage. Another good example is probably, "I remove my robe, and she is filled with lust." It doesn't necessarily mean she'll go to dice or succumb to my charms, but it'll complicate the story.<br/><br/>But that doesn't fully address persuasion. The threat of force is always easy to identify, but the threat of influence and manipulation are, by their nature, camouflaged. What I don't yet see, and what I'm looking for, is a way to say, "Look, this playful exchange of words we've been having? That wasn't 'just words'; it was a psychological assault to convince your character to do this thing. So either you start narrating your character as convinced of it, or I'm going to pick up these dice, throw them on the table, and possibly crush your character's soul instead." I'd like to be able to do that without breaking the tone of the story using hacky summations of complex psychological issues. I don't know if it's possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>IAWA - The \u201cI Stab You In The Face\u201d Game? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6539/iawa-the-i-stab-you-in-the-face-game/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="IAWA - The \u201cI Stab You In The Face\u201d Game? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6539/iawa-the-i-stab-you-in-the-face-game/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I'm not sure why persuasion is all that hard.

If you aren't into the idea of legitimately extrapolating, skip 0-significance particular strengths (and the rest of this post) altogether. That's fine, the game works fine without them.<br/><br/>Given that everyone still reading this post IS into the idea of legit extrapolations:<br/><br/>Having a 1-significance particular strength gives you two things: a d8 plus 1 of those options. Add significance, add things: a 2-significance particular strength gives you 3 things, a 3-significance gives you 4 things, etc.<br/><br/>Not having a particular strength at all gives you 0 things.<br/><br/>So it goes 0 things for no particular strength, 2 things for 1-significance, 3 things for 2-significance, etc. See the hole at 1 thing?<br/><br/>What gives you 1 thing? Let's call it, by extrapolation, a 0-significance particular strength.<br/><br/>A 0-significance particular strength gives you a d8 <i>or else</i> 1 choice. For choices, don't choose potent (which depends on the initial d8 the same way that doubly potent depends on potent) or broad (because, like, double your opportunities to roll no extra die!).<br/><br/>Thus: a 0-significance default particular strength would be worth a d8 but you'd choose no options. (You'd still specify forms, of course, and strictly speaking you'd name and describe it too.) A 0-significance far-reaching particular strength would let you say "oh no you do not!" when your character's not present, but you wouldn't get to roll an extra die for it, just your dice for your forms. (This was what happened in Ryan's game.) A 0-significance consequential particular strength would let you additionally reduce your victims' with violence (eg), but again you wouldn't get to roll an extra die for it.<br/><br/>With me so far?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146195/#Comment_146195" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T11:21:00+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 11:21AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lumpley</cite>Thus: a 0-significance default particular strength would be worth a d8 but you'd choose no options.

I assume that such ZSPS's must be earned through play (e.g. as negotiated consequences or somesuch) or granted by the GM for situational reasons (e.g. Ryan's game).<br/><br/>The Far Reaching example in Ryan's case brings up another sticky point in our game:  Are there any problems/pitfalls associated with two (or more) characters Conflicting with each other via Far Reaching Particular Strengths?  Say, if Tremillion has "Wickedly Clever" (d8, Consequential[Directly], Far Reaching) and Daol has "Network of Spies" (d8, Far Reaching), could a conflict be played out between the two, each in his respective sanctum sanctorum, contending through minions/machinations/plans-within-plans?  <br/><br/>I can easily see how this could be done, but is it within the spirit of the rules? (We discussed the possibility of the scenario above and shied away from it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146209/#Comment_146209" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T12:14:54+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 12:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, it's within the spirit of the rules, sure. Feel free. (How come "wickedly clever" is far-reaching?)<br/><br/>Anyway, yeah, "earned through play" is interesting, that's exactly where I was going next.<br/><br/>Dicewise, all particular strengths self-balance against the owe list. Rolling the extra d8, d10 or d12 is a sufficient tradeoff long-term; "too many" or "too powerful" particular strength dice can't break the game.<br/><br/>Far reaching particular strengths let you get into more fights than you would otherwise. They're not even self-balancing, they're simply good! The more the merrier.<br/><br/>Consequential particular strengths, if they proliferate, what you'll probably see is more early negotiation out of action sequences with more cutthroat outcomes when those negotiations don't work out. That'll change the tenor of play, but it won't make it uninteresting or unfun - more like, it'll tip play toward, oh, Viriconium Nights, say, away from Lyonesse. Not a bad thing, just a thing.<br/><br/>My point is: there's absolutely no reason to clamp down on particular strengths. The game works perfectly well if <i>every single established feature of the gameworld</i> is a potential 0-significance particular strength. There to be improvised into existence by whatever player happens to think of it.<br/><br/>"Hey, you know how the GM said that there's a swaying narrow bridge between one tower and the other? I'm waiting for you on that bridge, and I've been practicing fighting up there. I'm going to call it a 0-significance particular strength, for the d8, applies to my with violence." No problem! The extra d8 self-balances against my going on the owe list.<br/><br/>"Hey, you know how I've been chatting up your husband? I'm going to call him a 0-significance particular strength, far-reaching (particularly, reaching into your household), applies to my covertly." Cool! That just plain opens new opportunities for action sequences, which is good for everybody.<br/><br/>"Hey, you know how I've been carefully watching you fight? I'm going to call it a 0-significance particular strength, consequential (against your with violence), applies to my with violence. So, like, I've spotted how you expose your leg when you lunge, right?" And now you're going, "rrg, when we fight I seriously need to win" - and I haven't made it any more likely that I'LL win, I've just put more on the line.<br/><br/>To sum up: as far as 0-significance particular stregths go, how many you have in your game is entirely up to your tastes. If you have none, cool. If you let the GM only hand them out, earned, cool. If every player can use them at will to reflect the details of what's been going on in the game, cool. All cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146211/#Comment_146211" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T12:21:39+00:00" title="May 27, 2008 12:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent,<br/><br/>I ran In A Wicked Age at a con this weekend.

Nobody should narrate other characters' emotions. That's the point.</blockquote>Um, what point? <i>My</i> point is that a person's emotions aren't conscious decisions of the person. I can decide that I won't run away, but I can't decide not to be afraid. I can decide to stab you in the face, but I can't decide to be enraged. You can insult me, and I can choose to respond to it or ignore it, but I can't decide how it makes me feel, so I don't see why the player gets such control over the character.<blockquote>In the real world, what would happen if I wanted to convince you to go into a deathtrap, and I did my best, and you weren't convinced? Here's what: I'd give up, or else I'd escalate to something other than simple persuasion. I'd lie to you, or grab you by the hair, or follow through on my threats, or something. I'd stop trying to talk you into it, and instead try to force you.<br><br>Roll dice THEN, not before.</br></br></blockquote>I don't think we have quite the same conception of persuasion. My perception of how you think I'd go about persuading you is that my tactics would be limited to (1) presenting an argument or proposal for rational decisions, (2) deceiving you, (3) applying direct or indirect force. But I would do none of these things.<br><br>Instead of the deathtrap, let's go back to your yummy milkshake, and I'll persuade you to give it to me. "Oh really? How?" Well, my method will depend on why I want it. Let's just say that it looks tasty and that I'm hungry. First, I'd ask how you were doing. I imagine you'll say something like "Fine," or "Pretty Good," or "Can't complain." Maybe you say something like, "This milkshake is so yummy, how can anything go wrong!" Then I'd explain that I'm not feeling too good just then. You see, I skipped breakfast thinking I'd grab a meal later, but when I was long out of the house, I realized I didn't even have my wallet. Now, I'm starting to get cranky because I haven't eaten, and it'll be a long time before I can get some real food.<br/><br/>Then I'd ask if you could spot me for lunch. If you said yes, well, then I've gotten a lot more out of you than a milkshake, I've gotten a whole meal. The meal may even come with a yummy milkshake of my own, in a flavor of my choice. But if you said no, I might remind you of the time I brought snacks to a game when you happened to have missed lunch yourself. If you still demurred, I'd be understanding. Then, I'd ask, "Hey, do you think I could finish off the rest of that milkshake, to tide me over for a while?"<br/><br/>Now, I haven't presented a rationally convincing argument or presented a clear negotiation of valued items. If you see that in what I've done, it's purely coincidental. I've spent all that time creating a situation where you <i>feel obligated</i> to give me something. First, I get you to say how pleasant your situation was, to provide a contrast to my own. Even if you don't actually feel as pleasant as you said you were, you feel a pressure to be generous to live up to the emotional state that you attested too, lest you appear inconsistent or deceitful. By bringing up similar gifts in the past, I remind you of the implicit rule of reciprocity in our society, that gifts freely given should be freely repaid. Finally, I give you another gift, a concession, by changing my request from a full meal to a mere unfinished milkshake. By that time, having rejected so many seemingly reasonable offers of reciprocity, you'd feel responsible for my situation, since it would have been your refusals keeping me hungry. By the end, part of a milkshake would appear rationally reasonable, and you'd also be feeling a great emotional pressure to give me something, <i>anything</i>.<br/><br/>Is it <i>possible</i> that you wouldn't be effected in that way? Of course, but intense study has demonstrated that it is far from likely. In the same way, it's <i>possible</i> that if I take out a gun, point it at you, and pull the trigger, a bullet won't rip through your body injuring you; but it's not likely. It's so reasonable, in fact, that in IAWA, I can say, "I take out a gun, point it at you, and pull the trigger; <i>and</i> the bullet rips through your chest puncturing a lung." So it doesn't seem logical to me not to be able to narrate, "And after I say all of these things, you feel a sense of responsibility for my situation and an obligation to give me something in return."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw" title="Tablesaw"><img alt="Tablesaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw">Tablesaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146351/#Comment_146351" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T04:42:34+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  4:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After my psychological assualt, what do you do? Who knows? Maybe you explain that you're becoming a vegan, and this will be the last milkshake you ever drink, an emotional response that far overpowers my efforts. Maybe you give me a buck for a vending machine, satisfying the weight of reciprocity but not giving me anything near what I was aiming for. Maybe you recognize those feelings and confront me as a manipulator. But those feelings are there.<br/><br/><i>That</i> is persuasion. I take action, and it fucks up your mind, and you have to deal with it. It's like fighting, where I take action, and it fucks up your body, and you have to deal with it. The bullet can rip through your lung, why shouldn't the insult rip through your head?\n<blockquote>In your example, the GM needs to give up or else escalate, not reach into your character's head.<br/><br/>Hey, you know how over at RPGnet you could start a thread like "should rpgs have persuasion mechanics, or should we just roleplay persuasion out?" In the Wicked Age, you should roleplay persuasion out. No character is more persuasive than her player. Instead, every character and player has recourse to force and violence when persuasion isn't working.</blockquote>From what I've seen, it's true that no character is more persuasive than her player. But what I've also seen is that each character is actually <i>much less</i> persuasive than her player.<br/><br/>Because the effects of psychological threats can't be narrated in the same was as the effects of physical threats, characters can't persuade other characters in the way that a player can persuade another player. If the GM had stopped the game (without dice), the deathtrap transcript may have gone like this:<blockquote>GM: Hey, tell me why your character is so calm right now.<br/>Me: Well, he's a veteran warrior, and he doesn't set much stock by his sister.<br/>GM: I see. It just seemed that, from the way you've been playing your character, that he should be more hot-tempered. He usually isn't this good with words.<br/>Me: I guess, but I know that you're just trying to get him into the kennel, and I really don't want that.<br/>GM: No, that's fine. How about you just let the prince react to the princess's words--get angry or embarassed or whatever--and you can decide what to do from there.<br/>Me: Um, sure, okay.</blockquote>Sound reasonable? Care to identify the emotional manipulation used on me, who doesn't have an inviolable mind? Maybe I wouldn't have actually given in. I mean, there's no reason in the rules that I should--the GM can't dictate what my character feels, there's no game-system stick, and he can't technically go to dice until he switches to force (where my character will regain an advantage over his). Still, <i>I'd</i> feel the pressure. <br/><br/>But what happened instead was that GM had to convince me to agree to narrate that my character feels a particular emotion, using only the narration of actions of his character. That's incredibly difficult, far more so than persuading me directly.<br/><br/>In my understanding of the game, the desire of a player to protect her character from harm is part of the driving force of the system. But when I want to protect my character from emotional harm, all I need do is deny the existence of a threat and have my character act accordingly. Essentially, I roleplay, "I am rubber you are glue," until the other character switches to some other sort of threat. (This other threat shouldn't be called "escalation," which implies that the threat is necessarily greater. In your model, knocking the milkshake out of your hand is an "escalation," even though the danger is far less than me, perhaps, beginning to undermine your self-confidence. "I'm glad that you can feel comfortable having a milkshake out in public.") So this aspect of the system prevents a player from modeling character emotions naturally. This, in turn, ensures that persuasion will never be modeled accurately, and thus emotional manipulation will almost always fail, necessitating force. And now we've gone full circle to the "I stab you in the face" game.<br/><br/>As it stands, I guess there needs to be a disclaimer that, no, you can't create a character who will manipulate others' minds and emotions if you're playing a non-modified version of the game. That character's subtle persuasion will almost never work, because his emotional weapons will be ignored while other physical weapons are always respected. Your master manipulator must be a manipulator because of these kinds of physical actions, a manipulator who stabs people in the face fairly often. The character concept for the princess was flawed from creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw" title="Tablesaw"><img alt="Tablesaw" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tablesaw">Tablesaw</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146352/#Comment_146352" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T04:42:46+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  4:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this is another example IAWA drifitng slightly out of the tone it was intended for. I agree that Conan is never Shamed, and I certainly can't recall him succumbing to emotional maniuplation. But when I look at Nest of Vipers, I frankly don't see Conan. I see <cite>Hamlet</cite> and <cite>Othello</cite>. And when I look at Blood and Sex, I see <cite>Les Liaisons dangereuses</cite>. Those protagonists <i>must</i> be psychologically manipulable for their stories to work.<br/><br/>Perhaps the inviolability of the mind corresponds to the inability to shame. And consequently, in a game without Injured, the body should be inviolable to another's narration. In that game, I can pull out a gun, point it at you, and pull the trigger; but I can't puncture your lung, only scare you senseless.<br/><br/>Why am I so insistent on psychological persuasion? Because it's my favorite part of the game as written. During and after action sequences, the negotiation that occurs so exciting for me. And I'm somebody who usually hates it; I can't stand the deal-making aspects of <cite>Monopoly</cite>, <cite>Settelers</cite>, or <cite>Diplomacy</cite>. But taking a stick and seeing what I can get with it? Facing down a stick and seeing if I can turn it to my advantage? It's exhilarating.

My drinking the milkshake vs my fulfilling my social obligations to you. Characters in the Wicked Age don't have the complex mix of best interests that I do, but they still have some - more than are written on their sheets - and you can still play them against each other. If you can't figure out how to do it to this particular character just now, that's how it goes. After all, I'm not always going to fall for this obligation you're manufacturing either.<br/><br/>Thing two: it should be pretty damn easy to match action to words, to force the issue. ("Force and violence" means <i>forcing the issue</i>, not crude bodily attacks.) "She puts your sword into your hand and leads you to the door."<br/><br/>Thing three: ask the other player what her character does. This corresponds to the moment when you stop wheedling about my milkshake and look at me like it's a done deal, maybe with your hand out. "She's looking at you like you're the most shameful worm any woman ever had for a brother. What do you do?" This is a setup. When you say what your character does, you're committing to which dice you'll roll when she tries to stop you, which of course she will. "Screw this. I walk out." "Great! So that's, what, Directly and For Yourself? She stops you. She'll use With Love and Covertly. She catches your arm. 'Wait, brother, I relent...'"<br/><br/>The specific details of the mindfuck matter in cases two and three too, of course, not just in case one. The setup, the manufactured obligation, the undermined confidence - that conversation is what's going to get me to stop your action stupidly and to take stupid action for you to stop.<br/><br/>So, no, you absolutely can play a character as persuasive as you are, whose strength is manipulation. You don't do it by saying "your character becomes enraged, so you're obliged to play him that way now, the dice say so." You do it by playing his best interests opportunistically against each other, by deftly and subtly forcing the issue, and by setting him up to take actions that make him vulnerable to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146378/#Comment_146378" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T08:14:12+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  8:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious about this Vincent.
