The number fluxuates up and down depending on the success of checks made with that stat. Some quick examples I've sketched out:<br/><br/><br/>When you encounter something aberrant, eldritch, or horrifying, roll +sanity. On a miss, your sanity is reduced by 1.<br/><br/>When you hack the matrix, roll +ice. On a success, you accomplish your goal. On a partial success, choose: your ice is reduced by 1, or you fail. On a miss, it's both.<br/><br/>When you take damage, roll +constitution. On a miss, your con is reduced by 1. The GM will say whether your injury is temporary, ongoing, or permanent. If you reach -3 con, make a death roll.<br/><br/>When the villagers farm their fields and hunt for game, roll +food. On a success, you have enough food for the season. On a critical success, mark 1 stock. On a miss, choose 1: erase 1 stock, suffer 1 harm, or reduce the village's food by 1.<br/><br/><br/>Any systems that incorporate this? Any players with experience using it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439220/#Comment_439220" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T16:58:26+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  4:58PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dump that Apocalypse World zero and get with a Mortal Coil hero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439221/#Comment_439221" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T17:00:47+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  5:00PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, there are a number of games that do this.<br/><br/>Some of the "stats" in Apocalypse World and Monsterhearts come to mind (e.g. the Angel in Monsterhearts).<br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday has "Pools", which are effectively attributes, but you can spend and replenish them.<br/><br/>Hit points are effectively an attribute which fluctuates up and down, if you think about it.<br/><br/>I once designed a game called Winter Crucible, where players had four stats, and used them to overcome obstacles. Each stat suggested a different approach ("Disciplined", "Daring", etc.). Every roll you made would decrease or increase a certain stat, so that, for example, screwing up several Disciplined rolls would keep decreasing your Disciplined stat and increase your Daring stat, instead.<br/><br/>I only got to playtest it once, but it worked well in practice.<br/><br/><i>In a Wicked Age...</i> does this, as well. Stats can be "damaged" in conflicts, and act as hit points. You can redistribute fresh dice to your stats instead of increasing your abilities every time you play a character once again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439228/#Comment_439228" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T20:59:23+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  8:59PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All Outta Bubblegum!

Characters get progessively stumped by mundane tasks even as they evolve into hulks of fury. It's like Manly Guys Doing Manly Things the game.<br/><br/>I had an idea for a similar mechanic for a Cthulhu-esque game, your stat being Sanity. Roll under for Reason, to accomplish ordinary feats like fighting or negotiating, and roll over for Madness to attempt to grapple with the eldritch unknown. Various events, including failures, reduce the stat - the character degenerates and becomes progessively more obsessed with the occult - and eventually spiral to 0, where they die, commit suicide, or are abducted by horrendous forces. (I also liked the idea that if Sanity ever reached 7, the character would decide that all this space monster nonsense couldn't possibly be real, and refuse to participate further in the mystery.)<br/><br/>I'll check out these other RPGs mentioned, thanks for the tips.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439240/#Comment_439240" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-08T05:34:56+00:00" title="October  8, 2014  5:34AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a death spiral in both directions, meaning that you got a excremental negative and positive feedback loop.
