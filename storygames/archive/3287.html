Then, the publishers had some deal where if you donated blood to the Red Cross, they would give you a 50% discount on any purchase.  So, I literally bought my copy of Nobilis with my own blood.  I am muy macho.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut!  Nobody I know wants to play Nobilis.  I've got this stupid book, written in Gaimanese, that still manages to look pretty cool in spite of not having a Core Story--and I'll never play it.  Muy macho men also cry, sir... muy macho men also cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nTell me, O champions of Story Games, of your wonderful (and not so wonderful) experiences with Nobilis, like the time it held your hand during a sad movie, or the time you went on a roller coaster with Nobilis even though it wasn't tall enough to ride -- or the time you made these crazy characters and they did legendarily awesome things.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74597/#Comment_74597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T16:53:30+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  4:53PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Nobilis game where the characters all had Amnesia, due to the brutal shock of their Imperator dying.

The main problem with that is that PbP just sort of sucks the fun out of anything for me. I mean I've enjoyed most of the games I've been in, and I think I'm usually pretty much the last one to give up on a game that I've started, but quite honestly I came to the realization that I was more relieved than sad whenever one of the games died. This held true for pretty much any game I attempted in that medium.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside, I think I played in at least three Nobilis games. Two were standard Nobilis, and one was an attempt at a sort of world-building venture where we build a mythology for a world and play the resulting gods we create. One thing about Nobilis is that I always enjoyed the pre-game creation stuff. Nobilis are just fun to design, I love the mechanics of the system, and I enjoy chancel building and choosing imperator traits. In one game we made a world where normal people and ant people lived in a sort of quasi-fifties small town. We had some ability to control minor NPCs, especially ones tied to us in some way, and I enjoyed typing up conversations with ants in their clickity-language. I played the Power of Territoriality, who was pretty invested in Realm and had the Virtue of Loyalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlah, blah...Anyway, I think I might start up a game with a group of friends on of these days. I think I can get a group of interested players together now. One of my friends keeps talking about Amber Diceless, and I think he might enjoy Nobilis as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74599/#Comment_74599" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T17:05:29+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  5:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 6:45PM by Doyce.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before someone asks, the 'trick' to making things feel mythic and weird is to take metaphors absolutely literally, then use them in the game.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>There are lots of metaphors that cross food with knowledge.  "I need to digest that," etc.  I had a world where the people literally distributed and consumed (there it is again) knowledge as food.  One of the Powers in my game was a little old lady who was a good ol' midwestern cook. She loved that place -- and they worshiped her.<br/><br/>"Fighting an Illness."  One of my player's Anchors was sick.  We staged the Noble's fight to heal her Anchor as a battle within the body of the Anchor -- she was leading the timid, weakened villagers, and the encroaching illness were a bunch of rampaging Danes in longships (which ended up being a hint as to where the illness came from).<br/><br/>There were lots more.  Find a website with a good list of metaphors by category and play around.  For example:<br/><br/>    *      She had a special place in his heart. (Yeah, I used that one.  It was weird. She had some people over to visit in that special place, one time.)<br/>    *      He had finally come to the point of conclusion.<br/>    *      Deep despair. (Used that one too.)<br/><br/>    *      In the bowels of the ship. (That would be a FUN one to use.)<br/><br/>    *      She followed in her mothers' footsteps.<br/>    *      His head was spinning with excitement.  (Ack!)<br/><br/>    *      She had returned from the edge of death.<br/><br/>    *      A blanket of snow.<br/><br/>    *      Wrapping up the mystery.<br/>    *      Being true to the spirit of the agreement. (I actually had one guy interrogate the spirit of a contract to find out what it REALLY wanted.)<br/><br/>... and so on.<br/><br/>It's occurred to me that these types of things would work pretty well in Heroquests as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74602/#Comment_74602" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T17:21:06+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  5:21PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 5:21PM by ptevis.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a Revenge Tragedy game of Nobilis.

(Which, parenthetically, they shouldn't have survived in the first place.)"</i><br/>\n<br/>\nActually, it <i>is</i> possible (even if unlikely) for Nobles to live on after the death of their Imperator: they wouldn't be allowed to remain free, though, and could expect to be adopted into other Familias...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I've mentioned this elsewhere already, but the most recent story arc that I've completed was a little scenario called "Moonless Nights", run for some absolute beginners as a way of introducing them to RPGs. Their characters started out as common mortals who (each for reasons of their own) happened to be near an abandoned junkyard at the outskirts of the city when the Moon fell down to the Earth there, dying from an assassin's attack but still lucid enough to entrust what was left of her heart to these people for safekeeping. Once three full nights had passed after her death, they would have the one and only chance to raise her again by casting those fragments over the edge of the world, in keeping with an ancient ritual bound to her waxing and waning; of course, the first slight problem with that was coming to terms with the fact that the world <i>had</i> an edge... So during actual play the Imperator was left undefined and remained out of touch (what with her being dead and all), her Chancel had faded into a ghostly ruin of a silver palace which could be entered at great risk through conjured moonlight, and the PCs (along with the players) only gradually learned bits and pieces about the setting while avoiding the killers and nightmares on their trail. And afterwards, once the Moon had been rescued and the villain behind it all banished, the players had the opportunity to further define what the Moon and her realm had become in this new reincarnation, and to decide whether their characters wished to remain in her service as true Nobles. All in all, that's a pretty good way to run an introductory piece, I think: all I needed to ask from the players at the very beginning were concepts that they associated with the moon, and those then became the Estates of their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Also, I'd suggest that the Core Story of <i>Nobilis</i> is the Breakthrough and the attempts to thwart it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paradoxdruid" title="Paradoxdruid"><img alt="Paradoxdruid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paradoxdruid">Paradoxdruid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74613/#Comment_74613" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T19:21:02+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  7:21PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found Nobilis is very suited to mini-campaigns (2 to 4 sessions) and especially as a gateway game for people who have never roleplayed (I've introduced about a dozen people to RPGs through Nobilis).<br>\n<br>\nThe typical path is to spend the first session explaining the world and rules, do character creation, and design the chancel/imperator.  There's enough evocative coolness there that even though there's no official roleplaying, people will often start thinking "what kind of chancel would my character want?" and get into interesting discussions and compromises.<br>\n<br>\nFrom there, I have time until the next session to pull their collective awesome ideas into a coherent story.  So I don't really have pre-meditated stories in Nobilis, usually.<br>\n<br>\nOne mini-arc that I remember particularly well had the Franciscan monk power of Hospitality stuck defending a group of Banes that were corrupting the chancel into a twisted, calcified mockery of itself and wounding the imperator because of his allegiance to Hospitality, while the power of Disillusion (the ghost of a betrayed KGB spy) worked with the power of Delusion to track down the Cammoran who was responsible for giving the Banes the magics they needed to enact their changes.  All against a landscape of crosses and double-crosses by the power of Innocence (who was anything but) who wanted Lord Entropy to destroy the current power of Fog.  Reading what I just wrote, I don't think I'm conveying it well, but it was very fun to play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74616/#Comment_74616" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T19:50:42+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  7:50PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doyce brings the wisdom:  In this game, symbols are <i>real</i> ... another country, not another type of thing.

A little bit of serendipity had brought me together with a new gaming group that was interested in playing Nobilis but had no HG/GM for their game.  I had gotten the book not that long before and was really liking is, so into the breach I went.  <br><br>We started, as most Nobilis campaigns do, by designing the characters.  As we talked about the individual Powers that each of the Nobili would represent, we talked about what those words meant to these characters.  What was vengeance?  What was passion?  What was a seed?  If you decide to run a game of Nobilis, fucking DO THIS.  It will set the stage and stakes immediately.  It lets you know as the HG exactly how to punch the PCs buttons.  I can still remember Neil defining his character's Power, Vengeance, as "wild justice".  Oh, the imagery that came with just those two words.  <br/><br/>We then went straight from PC, Imperator, and Cahancel creation right into a half-session of gaming.  I opened with Phil's character, an aged woman from the wouth, laying on the floor bleeding from the chest.  You see, she had just been stabbed in her heart with the shard of Seeds.  We then took that half-session to set the world stage, see the setting from the eyes of a newcomer, and establish the PC dynamics between each other and their Imperator.  <br/><br/>I opened the next session with an Excrucian stabbing the Power of Storms nearly to death right outside the PCs chancel.  Then the PCs took it from there.  They examined the Power of Storms and removed the unreal (literally) poison from him, which took the form of a black apple.  This led them on a metaphysical quest that, after a great number of adventures, resulted in the players having Luciphur lead them up the tree of life to Heaven where they encountered another version of Luciphur, as time becomes an object when you step outside of a world.  There they took a seed from the black apple and planted it in Heaven, as such writing the Excrucian into reality and creating what we affectionately call the "Reverse Nettle Rite".  The result of this was the concepts that the Excrucian would embody were written into reality as a whole.  This concept was, of course, destruction.  So I rewind the game to the beginning of time and tell the players that a snake plucks a fat black apple off of a tree in the middle of a beautiful forest and offers it to two naked people.  The seed from the apple becomes the Seed of Destruction becomes the seed in all of humanity for pain, hardship and annihilation.  <br/><br/>My favourite part of the whole campaign was probably the time that I had the PCs go to the Nobilis ball.  They got to meet tons of Nobilis, some silly and some serious, though all powerful.  One of the PCs, Phil's Power of Seeds was talking with a young Power of Language.  She told Phil's character all about her lot and role and such and the amazing things that are communicated in this world.  Phil's PC was, of course, curious as to what the Power of Languages was talking about.  To which I smiled, described the Power of Languages as putting her hands over Phil's PC's eyes and saying "Like the secret language of Love."  She then pulled her hands away and revealed all the ways in which everyone at the ball loved, or didn't love, each other.  This included having the players say exactly what their feelings were between each other and a goodly number of PCs.  The phrase "I love you because you're <i>not her</i>" was definitely spoken.  <br/><br/>My suggestion for running a game of Nobilis is to sit back and relax.  The PCs are incredible shakers of universes, their powers are nigh infinite, and the system does a whole ton of world-building up front.  The approach that worked for me best on Nobilis was to take all of that in stride and roll with the waves.  Let the players define what their powers mean, how their Imperator acts, all of that stuff.  Once that's over, then you start throwing weird shit at them.  Come up with a couple of really jaw-dropping images, stuff that just blows your mind with how cool it looks in your head, and start your first session with one of those images.  Let the players react and create based on that image.  When things start to get a little slow you go right back to that image well and pull out another one for the group.  <br/><br/>Don't be afraid of creating on-the-fly symbolism.  Drop in something that you think sounds cool; for instance a statue of the Egyptian goddess Bast crying milk from its eyes.  What does that mean?  I have no clue!  But the players will immediately start running off and talking to the powers of Milk and Cats and Egypt I betcha, and they'll start coming up with definitions for you.  <br/><br/>Also, like I described above, I really suggest having one of the PC powers be new to the world.  It gives the players a reason to explore some of it and discuss the setting in-game.  I would also suggest that one of the PCs be an ancient, or at least old Power.  This will give the Familia a real family feel, as in generational.  Occasionally have you Imperator drop hints as to who the previous holders of his Shards were.  Nothing too revealing.  Keep it cryptic.  Let the players decide what's cool and have them chase after it.  <br/><br/>I guess that's the best lesson I took away from that game.  The world is massive, and everything that a PC does can have such incredible import.  Set up some nifty bangs, pay attention to the players flags and let them guide the game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74628/#Comment_74628" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T21:11:04+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  9:11PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2007 9:14PM by Doyce.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something else just remembered, very distinctly.<br/><br/>Nobilis was the first game book in which I read the phrase "Social Contract," and in which there is a section on how to approach the creation of one with your group.<br/><br/>Good friggin' game.

I think it's my favourite book on my gaming shelf, if not my favourite game. <br/><br/>I had the privilege of playing in a 3 year long campaign of it over mirc that ended last year, which ranks as one of the best roleplay campaigns I've ever played. The AP transcripts are <a href="http://www.steampowerpublishing.co.uk/acrystalmethod/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>I played Jacob Hart, the latest in a long line of Nobles of Obsession. We had a fine tradition, that each Lord of Obsession would find himself obsessed with a mortal, to the point where they literally offered up their heart on a plate (there's that symbol as real again!) to the mortal, who ate it and became the next in the line. <br/><br/>It was messed up, and Jacob spent a good half of the campaign trying to wriggle out of his destiny and find a way to un-enoble himself. He failed, and became obsessed with Queen Puck of the fairies. But before he did the deed his Imperator, the Fallen Angel Balthiel, took the familia to Hell (ostensibly because we'd nearly let an excrucian destroy him) where Jacob had to choose between oblivion, passing his heart to Puck then and there or being punished by Balthiel through the Rite of Agony/the Whip. Jacob was allergic to pain and nearly took the plunge into oblivion, but chose agony instead. This remains one of the hardest IC choices I've had to make! It was seriously intense.<br/><br/>The game climaxed with us nearly destroying our own Imperator (by releasing the Angel of Blades he kept as his sword) and exposing one of Entropy's nobles as an excrucian-lover, prompting an invasion of our Chancel and a full-on battle that lasted two or three sessions.<br/><br/>Nobilis is great! It needs to be played more, although god knows how I'd actually run it. That thing is intense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76590/#Comment_76590" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-19T08:14:18+00:00" title="June 19, 2007  8:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had two sessions with the game.<br/><br/>For the first, I introduced it to the guys I started gaming with.

Rite of Holy Fire, etc."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIt's true that Holy Fire and the various defensive Gifts can overlap enough to render a character more or less invulnerable, and Immortals simply <i>cannot</i> be killed by anything in the universe. That's hardly surprising, since the system is designed to discourage direct confrontations between empowered beings and encourage scheming in order to gain an advantage. However, there are always limits to and ways around those protections. For instance, Holy Fire won't ignite against <i>all</i> mundane attacks, only those that are offensive enough to someone of the target's spiritual stature: an ordinary gunshot against an otherwise undefended Noble with Spirit less than 3 may well cause a serious wound, even if he has invoked the Fire recently. And of course, it's relatively easy to create distractions to keep a low-Spirit foe from performing the Rite at all, and then strike when he's vulnerable...<br/>\n<br/>\n1of3: <i>"Killing a Noble is almost impossible, but damage is the only way hostile actions can stack. (And "dead" is the only mechanic state, where a character is overcome any manner. Wait... it isn't. You still got anchors.)"</i><br/>\n<br/>\nEven if a dead Noble does somehow manage to linger on as a ghost after his death, it just means that a would-be assassin will have to take care of those Anchors, as well, preferrably after gathering them together in some place where they can't be used for further Rites of the Servant.<br/>\n<br/>\n1of3: <i>"Overpowering a Noble with one large Miracle seems to be the only way. But how to overpower a Noble? You can throw a mountain, but that only hinders his Aspect. Domain is still available."</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not really sure what you mean by hindering someone's Aspect? You could dodge or block a thrown mountain with miracles of Aspect, certainly, or possibly avoid the assault with some suitable application of Domain. But those actions would always require spending at least a few MPs (barring any "perfect defence" Gifts, of course). And if you are outnumbered by the enemy or face something massively powerful (such as a full Warmain with Aspect 7), the chance of defeat becomes a very real possibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning" title="gamera_spinning"><img alt="gamera_spinning" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/280/n8IY31021JMRT.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gamera_spinning">gamera_spinning</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105993/#Comment_105993" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T11:07:09+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 11:07AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>I ran a Revenge Tragedy game of Nobilis.

He was nearly mad with pain, and quite insane.<br><br>I remember their first villain was the Steward of their Chancel who was an incredibly powerful maniac who hated them, and since they took extremely low scores for power over their Chancel, she just owned them.<br/><br/>And I remember Beowulf getting into a brawl with a giant he was trying to coerce into giving him information, and then remembering that he had a code that made him always fight to the death. Whoops.<br/><br/>Oh, and he led a group of ten peasants to victory against a battalion of elite soldiers. That was pretty badass.<br/><br/>This makes me want to play it again.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106003/#Comment_106003" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T11:29:49+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 11:29AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a multi-session arc of Nobilis back in college.  There was a monstrous baby of an Angel and a Demon (who had been in love before the fall) chained up in the basement of the Chancel.<br/><br/>I ran a one-shot League of Extraordinary Americans game using Nobilis.  The main characters were undead Blackbeard, John Henry, Casey Jones, etc.  We fought wendigo and stuff.<br/><br/>We played Nobilis on IRC a while back.  It was very steampunk and ridiculous.  It also included a whole bunch more stuff with Anchors that I'd ever had in a game before.  We rarely played the actual powers themselves, so it was more like the <i>Sandman</i> issues where Dream is in the background and his various minions are up to things.<br/><br/>Now I'm getting ready to run new Changeling, which has a lot of Nobilis-y things about it, especially in the dark powers that the characters once served.  It's like "what if you ran away from your Chancel to hide in the real world and your Imperator really wanted to drag you back, kicking and screaming."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106004/#Comment_106004" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T11:33:00+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 11:33AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, the mechanics for Nobilis are awesome.

Getting over that, however, lets you find out that there actually is method to the madness. <br/><br/>As for my Nobilis stories, my favorite moment was when one PC smuggled Mount Everest into a party, in his shoe, so that he could smite his nemesis with it over tea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106062/#Comment_106062" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-01T12:44:01+00:00" title="November  1, 2007 12:44PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand, I agree.

There was a Power of Dogs who was an enNobled dog, and had something of a love-triangle between a Fox Spirit who was working for the Cammora and an uplifted Poodle who was the chief of the Dog Police.   There was a Power of Despair who was desperately cheerful, because every previous Power of Despair had died at his own hand.  There were a lot of NPC's and events that were inspired directly by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They Might Be Giants songs</span>.  <br/><br/>The game had kind of a cool superheroes--meet--Jane--Austen vibe that I haven't seen before or since.
