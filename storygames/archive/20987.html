It's not just a question of "yes/no/but/and" (which are simplifications), but of all kinds of nuance in resolution.<br/><br/>Consider that you are answering some form of question with the "yes" or "no" involved here. Well, what is that question? Is it crystal-clear, or is it somewhat ambiguous? <br/><br/>Let's say I want to stop a fight between Jake and Judy, because I'm afraid they'll hurt each other, and I care for them both. I yell, but they don't listen. I have a high-powered taser, and I run up and try to zap Jake (who's on top of Judy right now). He sees me coming at the very last minute and tries to grab it with one hand.<br/><br/>What are we resolving? Is it my attempt to zap him, or my intent to stop the fight?<br/><br/>Either can be the case, depending on the game. What if we mix the two?<br/><br/>Choose:<br/>* You zap Jake, sending him into spasms.<br/>* Jake and Judy stop fighting.<br/><br/>Which one is "yes, but", and which is "no, and"? It's already getting a little more complex.<br/><br/>Now, what if add some other possible outcomes? Here are some possibilities off the top of my head:<br/><br/>"Not yet, but you can try again." You don't succeed, and Jake gets Judy's arm in a nasty, twisted position. Do you want to try again?<br/><br/>"You can succeed, but only if you..." ... get hurt/hurt someone yourself/get someone to help you/are willing to do something you didn't want to do (draw on Dark Side magic/summon a spirit/call the cops/set off the alarm/admit to Jake that you're carrying his child).<br/><br/>What about just details of the scene, though? Lots can happen, and things can follow your intentions and yet go entirely unlike the way you wanted them to.<br/><br/>What if you zap Jake, knocking him unconscious, and stop the fight... just as your mom walks in to the room?<br/><br/>What if you zap him and stop the fight... and then we find out that you killed him/wiped his memory?<br/><br/>What if you zapping Jake sets off an alarm, triggering a door to come slamming down on Judy's arm?<br/><br/>What if you zap him only to find out that it wasn't Judy at all, but an alien in disguise?<br/><br/>Some of these are clearly "yes, but"; we could do the same for "no"-type outcomes. But there's still a lot of (potential fruitful) ambiguity in what exactly your intention was - was it just to zap him, was it to stop them fighting, was it to make sure neither of them was hurt at all, or something else?<br/><br/>What if the outcome is that, yes, you manage to zap him and stop the fight... but it's another player who gets to narrate how you do it? Is that a "yes, but", or something else? Even if that player narrates something good for your character?<br/><br/>What about "No, you don't zap him and you don't stop the fight... because the floor collapses and you all fall into a cave complex under the house?" Or even, "No, you don't zap him... because you wake up, realizing it was all a dream?"<br/><br/>How about, "Instead of resolving your action, we fade to black, switching to another scene"?<br/><br/>Some of these are silly, but I think there's a large scope which shorthands like "no, but" try to simplify, but in any particular situation we can have room for various interpretations and outcomes which might not fit cleanly into those categories.<br/><br/>It can definitely be fun to explore.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460583/#Comment_460583" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T16:22:30+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  4:22PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Annalise does this thing where the spotlight player and GM (a role that rotates per scene) determine two stakes, orthogonal to each other, but then they can add more stakes on top of that.<br/><br/>You can have 2-4, even 6 separate conflicts on the table. <br/><br/>Each stake gets its own die for resolution. The spotlight player rolls a d6 per conflict and assigns them to conflicts.
