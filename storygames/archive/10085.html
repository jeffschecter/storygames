So calling it a game feels odd.</blockquote>\nYeah, this was our experience too.<br/><br/>But anyway.<br/><br/>About a month ago, Roger and I sat down to play <i>Microscope</i>.<br/><br/>We brainstormed some ideas for settings (First contact, virtual reality, the consequences of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity" rel="nofollow">Singularity</a>, return of magic to a high-tech world) and settled on the last one there. We made it dark.<br/><br/>We decided our world would start with the return of magic, in 2012 (because why not) and end with either the fading of magic, the ascension of humanity to godhood, or the extinction of mankind. We ended up picking Ascension. We made it light.<br/><br/>Our lists of YES and NO (mostly NO) were largely to steer things toward a more "Shadowrunny" world (nothing too anime, no outer-space aliens, yes to complex cybernetics) and also to rein in our problems with scifi and fantasy genre work (no time travel, no teleportation). These had the benefit of keeping things gritty. Only one thing surprised me, which was when Roger put "second coming of Jesus" on the YES list.<br/><br/>Remembering the exact play order is tricky, and I've recently been told that my APs are too long, so I'll just list off our various Eras, Events, and Scenes.<br/><br/>THE RETURN OF MAGIC (Dark)<br/>-World Governments Collapse (Dark)<br/>THE MECH WARS (Dark)<br/>-Human-Machine Interface Developed (Light)<br/>-Australian Massacre (Dark)<br/>-The Battle for the Moon (Light)<br/>--My God, it's full of Dragons!/How did the human mech army react to the sneak attack? (Dark)<br/>UNDEAD HEGEMONY (Light)<br/>-Rise of the Vampire Sultans (Light)<br/>--Why did the people of Europe freely reject technology?<br/>STRUGGLE WITH COMPATIBILITY (Dark)<br/>-Integration Event (Light)<br/>--What led Dr. Jones to first contemplate fusing magic and technology?<br/>ASCENSION TO GODHOOD (Light)<br/><br/>We had two Legacies: Always Vigilant, which was created after the mech-dragon war thing, and had one Dark use, and The Virus Mutates, which was born Dark when the Europeans were bowing to their vampire overlords, and was used Light when it evolved to allow the first human-mech integration.<br/><br/>Overall, we found it worked pretty well with two players, although I think we both agreed that it would've been better with one or two more, just to spice it up.<br/><br/>My high points: seeing the random things come out of our heads, and trying to figure how it would all work together. Roger and I have very different approaches to this kind of genre, clearly (moon dragons vs. mechs is all Roger; pseudo-religious pacifist vampires is me). I loved how each little strange idea would cause something new to spiral out. If Roger added something, I would riff on it in ways he couldn't expect, and vice versa. I also liked how we started re-integrating our abandoned setting concepts. In the form of magic creatures, we used First Contact, and I planted the seeds of a magic/technological fusion that would serve the role of Singularity. I even think our risen Christ figure would've ended up being some kind of magic-cyborg thing.<br/><br/>My issues: I haven't read the new tone debt rules yet, but the old way was a bit buggy and confusing. I had no idea when it was really appropriate to "spend" it, and why you would need to anyway. It's a good bookkeeping tool I suppose (this scene is too light for this dark era, so let's jazz it up a bit), but I think player-consensus could achieve that goal just as easily. Also, as a lot of people have said, I didn't really get a "game" vibe from it. It seemed like a fun engine for creating amazingly detailed and surprising settings in which to play a game, or else some kind of framework for shared storytelling (which is a good thing in and of itself, but if that's the case, it doesn't need so many rules).<br/><br/>Also, during scenes, Roger and I found we didn't bother picking characters or setting up locations much. It might have been because there was only two of us, so there was no need to delineate responsibility that much, but after the first scene (Dr. Jones and his dabbling) we stopped doing it. During the scene where the vampires conquer Europe, I was Lens, so I just narrated broadly, and let Roger give his input, and then adopted it where appropriate. In the dragon sneak attack, we started as two distinct characters, but soon found ourselves narrating the dragons, the other mech pilots, the other people of the world, and not worrying too much about ownership or control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224069/#Comment_224069" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T13:54:24+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  1:54PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for writing this up, Adam.  I kept meaning to get around to it...<br/><br/>If I played it again I think I'd be tempted to drop the scene-roleplaying part of it right out.  It was alright, but it didn't feel like it was adding as much value to the process as some other parts of the game.<br/><br/>We sorta had to throttle ourselves back a bit during the first bit of brainstorming.  It was tempting to latch on to the first idea that seemed pretty good... but we kept pushing at it until we had something REALLY good.  Very similar to the PtA pitch process.<br/><br/>The turn order seemed a bit confusing, possibly exacerbated by only having two players.  How many chances does the Lens have to add stuff each turn?  It seemed like it might be a lot.<br/><br/>Legacies:  These were a nice part of the game, once we got into the groove.  I noticed there's not really a produced list of the uses of the Legacy in game chronological order, which seemed a bit weird, but probably not actually problematic.<br/><br/>It does feel like you're holding on to a lot of the game state inside your own head, which is okay, but it might be really hard to resume a game after any sort of break.  I kinda felt like it would have been useful to produce a cast list or something like that.<br/><br/>I might be tempted to play this on full-sized sheets of paper rather than index cards.  Enough room to capture more of the game state.  But maybe not.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just us, but I think we tended towards broad history rather than deep history -- maybe to our detriment.  I might try a houserule like every Event needs at least one Scene before you can add anything higher.  But on the other hand you can just drop Events or even Eras you might not, after all, be all that interested in.<br/><br/>In summary, it was a good fun experience all around.  I'd do it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224125/#Comment_224125" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-11T18:35:03+00:00" title="August 11, 2009  6:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2009 6:35PM by deadlytoque.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, my approach would be to put MORE focus on Scenes, to make them matter.

In fact you'll notice that scenes are the only part of the game where the players interact directly.<br/><br/>Likewise once the scene starts, the player that created the scene definitely has no greater authority than other players.<br/><br/>What I find is that the more you openly collaborate or come to a consensus, it approaches group storytelling and gets watered down, but if you stay away from that and just play straight as written, it doesn't feel that way at all. You communicate with the other players by what you make happen within the history, not by saying what should or could happen within the history, if you see what I mean.<br/><br/>Tone Debt / Taking Control is a way to extend your authority within a scene, to make stuff happen you want to see, but of course if you're playing loose or coming to agreement about what happens you'd never have any reason to use it.<br/><br/>I definitely think this clear "don't collaborate" stance is something I haven't emphasized never enough in the current text. I'll be fixing that.<br/><br/>Try it with no collaboration or discussing "what should happen" or suggesting things to each other. I think you'll find scenes are a lot more gripping.<br/><br/>[I'm off to GenCon, so if I'm slow to respond, that's why]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nanenj" title="nanenj"><img alt="nanenj" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nanenj">nanenj</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224718/#Comment_224718" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T11:36:15+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 11:36AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, this is driving me nuts, I've been reading APs of Microscope all over the place, yet, I can't seem to find out any more about it.

With no GM, and no obvious objectives for our characters we basically sat around until we started sharing the story collaboratively. My character was the security commander signals guy, watching the radar screens for signs of attack, and Roger played the officer in charge of the base, and I just stared at the screen and he just read a book in his quarters, until we decided the shit had better hit the fan before we gave up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225512/#Comment_225512" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T15:05:46+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  3:05PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you chose characters, did you pick someone who would let you answer the Question?

It's more useful when there are lots of players, particularly if other players already picked characters that put them in a good position to answer the question.
