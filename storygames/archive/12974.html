What RPGs engage with culture?<br/><br/>Here's why I'm asking. I'm delivering a presentation to a cross-cultural research centre in October. It's gonna be about RPGs and culture. I'm particularly interested in games that position player characters in "other" cultures, and games that have culture clash as a theme.<br/><br/>So, like, Empire of the Petal Throne. Kagematsu. Simon C reminded me about Sign In Stranger. What else? Not just "good" examples. Games that screwed it up are welcome too. (Er, but not Racial Holy War thanx.)<br/><br/>And to make this thread more than just a list of titles... anyone have experiences where they "got culture" out of a game experience? What happened? How much did the game itself contribute to the experience?<br/><br/>Thanks! - Morgan, who is mostly just a lurker                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_292428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292428/#Comment_292428" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T02:11:08+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  2:11AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi "Morgan the Lurker"!<br/><br/>I would say that any role-playing game engage with culture in some way. By inventing fictional cultures we get an alternative to our own. We immerse in the fiction, making it as "real" as possible, and at the same time regard it in relation to our own cultural codes.

Within those cultures is a description of the culture (about half a page), followed by "advantages that members of this culture share", and "disadvantages that members of this culture share". You automatically get one "good" one for free, but you can get a second advantage (or other bonuses) by taking a cultural disadvantage. Some were physical (bonuses/drawbacks to certain activities like running, climbing etc based on cultural roots), others were mental or social. There were like 4-5 ads and disads for each culture.<br/><br/>I really liked this idea: Unlike most pick-and-choose ads/disads system, they were very tied to culture, and culture in turn tied to character. <br/><br/>Like, I think this would be a perfect system to rework to a more realistic/historic game or even fantasy excursion as well, particularly well-researched games set in say Africa or Europe: Like, I would make a small list for Mali characters, another for Almoravid characters/Berber tribes, another for Ghanan based on that empire, etc. <br/><br/>Or, say families/domains within ancient Japan or China, etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292708/#Comment_292708" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T18:27:28+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  6:27PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: morgue</cite>Me too.

There were a crazy number (ten thousand? something like that) of military-issued katana (given to officers) that were returned to HQ as "damaged", all with detailed written reports. A majority of them were from officers who simply assumed all the legendary katana-stories were true, and were totally surprised when the katana broke (usually not shatter, but curve left/right and become unusable) after they forcefully struck a rock wall or steel pipe/plating with it instead of simply slicing it in half like it were nothing.<br/><br/>The fiction behind katanas and ninjas, especially fun/action/drama, goes crazy with them.<br/><br/>We only picked up on the fever that the Japanese themselves expressed towards those bits of native culture.

This is the closest there is. Fictionalized, but no magic.<br/>One was pro-made in the early/mid 90s, daikatsugeki.<br/>The other is an indie made game, hiden no koe:<br/><a href="http://www.ps-hiroshima.com/rpg/doujin/hiden01.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ps-hiroshima.com/rpg/doujin/hiden01.htm</a><br/><br/>1 game focuses on the heian period, but includes magic and stuff. Heian-yakyoku, an indie made game:<br/><a href="http://www.ps-hiroshima.com/rpg/doujin/yaeanyakyoku.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ps-hiroshima.com/rpg/doujin/yaeanyakyoku.htm</a><br/>There are two supplements for other games (Doublecross 2e, Demon Parasite) which have "playsets" for a heian-themed game, but again it's a highly fictionalized, magicy-fantasy game, even if it uses real place and people names at times.<br/><br/>1 game focuses on the sengoku period, kind of in the vein of the recent boom of interest in the sengoku period (caused by the Sengoku Basara game series, recent TV dramas, etc): But while it features real historic people and battles, it's also "exXxtreme'd" up a bit with magic, ninjas, etc. Sengoku Kamui, a professionally made game. Cute strategic combat system.<br/><br/> Other games (like the recent FEAR game Tenka Ryoran) might also have historic places and people, but its extreme'd up with magic and time travel and stuff.<br/><br/>So basically, the straight answer is "No". But also, "two games, but you have to squint a bit to see it", if you count "emulation of historic movies and TV dramas" as equal to "straightforward consideration of historical matter", which honestly I kinda do (no mecha or lasers).<br/><br/>Neither here nor there, though. Still, culture aside, Barbarians of Lemuria still has one of the best "your culture comes out in actual gameplay" mechanics (as above) for basic RPGs. And I'm reading How We Came To Live Here, which is super-immersive, but also requires a lot more attention and work in the learning of its unique playstyle (in other words, a lot more upfront learning in order to understand how the game works enough to play; its not a game you can bust out and just start running from scratch, while BoL kinda is).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I kind of like the idea of age-based salary systems.</blockquote>\nHeh, also neither here nor there :-) , but while it might be cool in an RPG setting, in real life it means that if you work as a salaryman for a company, and the company lays you off for whatever reason (downsizing, bankruptcy, etc), and you are over 40 years old, you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever find a good job again, ever.<br/>Not entirely true, but I use those "ever"s as a metaphor to represent just how utterly painful, bleak and desperate the situation is.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292739/#Comment_292739" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T21:31:49+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  9:31PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 9:33PM by Trevis.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't "Blossoms Are Falling" for Burning Wheel fall into this area?<br/><br/><br/>edit... oops.  misread the question.

I'm primarily thinking of Bushido, Sengoku, and L5R - although Sengoku has explicit rules for running a strictly historical campaign. I'm not saying this is wrong, but part of me had chalked this up to the constant mysticizing of foreign cultures and / or the influence of Dungeons and Dragons.<br/><br/>L5R and D&amp;D (specifically the Oriental Adventuers stuff) went so far as to fabricate entirely fictionalized settings (Rokugan and Kara-Tur, respectively - although Rokugan was the setting for a later version of Oriental Adventures, wasn't it?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292789/#Comment_292789" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T07:18:59+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  7:18AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: musashi74</cite>I'm not saying this is wrong, but part of me had chalked this up to the constant mysticizing of foreign cultures and / or the influence of Dungeons and Dragons.</blockquote>\nThrough examples above, I didn't list nearly all of the "historic Japan...

Also, the notion of generating hoards of 'cultural monsters' happens just as much with western game settings, I'd argue. I mean, certain versions of D&amp;D are "Medieval Europe BUT WITH MAGIC AND MONSTERS!", likewise the Conan stories (and the sword and sorcery settings inspired by them and others) were "whatever historical period/culture Howard thought would be cool BUT WITH MAGIC AND MONSTERS!" Finally, you also see the same "solitary badass monster --&gt; species of monsters to kill in droves" thing happens with western monsters (Medusa, Hydra, Dragons, et cetera). <br/><br/>I think the latter part might be more of an artifact of gaming than of cultural attitudes, since there is (or was anyway) an expectation that since you have these generic rules that are supposed to handle whatever situation might come up, it was jarring to have "The one, single Hydra" as a foe, since you knew other folks in other groups would be fighting the same one, only hyrda. As for the former (MAGIC!) there's probably a lot more cultural stuff going on there, since you see it in various forms of entertainment, and I'm starting to ponder why you see modern stuff amping up the supernaturalism compared to the present, but more subdued (I guess?) supernaturalism in myth. Is it just because we like everything EXXXXTREME in our current culture?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
