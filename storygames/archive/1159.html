                    My first Spelljammer game was the day after I learned what in media res was in school.<br/><br/>One of the players mentioned that none of the players took a thief.  So, I started the game with the party's ship chasing down a fiery pyramid manned by undead and captained by the mummy who worshipped a now dead sun.<br/><br/>"Why are we chasing him?"<br/><br/>"He killed the thief in the party."<br/><br/>I've never seen a party chase down a villain they had never met before with so much vigor and excitement.<br/><br/>To me Spelljammer is about swinging from the deck of your space galleon onto the deck of a Neogi Death Spider in order to liberate the slaves within.  It is about stealing artifacts to fuel your artifact furnace so you can get to the next sphere.  It is about being stranded on an asteroid.<br/><br/>It is about throwing the D&amp;D mythos into space and turning them each up to 11 and then swashbuckling to and fro.<br/><br/>It is about lovingly naming your ship together and brutally taking other ships apart with cheap magic user tricks and total mis-use of traditional magic items.<br/><br/>It is about getting drunk on the Rock of Bral and running iron into Krynnspace and gold into Realmspace.  It is about landing your ship at Waterdeep and acting like the king fucking shit, thinking of Elminster as a local fucking hick huckster.<br/><br/>It was about strewing the D&amp;Dish toys all over the living room, stepping on them and enjoying the patterns they made on your scarred feet.<br/><br/>Because Vecna, Kaz, Githyanki, Githzari, Slaadi, Beholders, and dragons just get better when you throw them into space amidst the star pirates and floating dwarven citadels.<br/><br/>Or maybe they suck and its all childhood memories, smoke and mirrors.                </div>

                            The biggest problem with Spelljammer was the attempt to squash the existing (at the time) settings into it.  So, to awesome it up, the first thing we do is divorce it from Toril, Krynn, and Oerth.  (They were at least smart enough to say Athas was just, like, not accessible)<br/><br/>Spelljamming itself was awesome, and one of the cool bits of the game was <i>exploration</i>, so let's focus on that.  It already has a pretty good system-creation mechanism.  We don't want to make it too much more complex.  Create a maybe Traveller-esque type loosely-affiliated Empire with good reason to want to expand its borders (merchant princes, etc.) and suddenly you have a reason to explore.  <br/><br/>Of course we keep the Rock of Bral.  Of course we keep Beholders in space, and the Neogi, and the Mind Flayers.<br/><br/><br/>But you know what I first thought was crap about Spelljammer, but later realized was awesome?  (And probably in a way the designers never intended?)<br/><br/>Space in Spelljammer is room temperature.  Well <i>of course</i> it's room temperature.  D&amp;D physics isn't like our physics.  In the real world, we have an Absolute Zero, and heat is simply the movement of molecules and the release of energy.  Conversely, D&amp;D has both fire <i>and</i> cold as energies, heat and freezing.  So, introducing cold energy makes things more cold, which means there is no Absolute Zero.  So, as a result, there's a different 'state of rest', and room temperature makes as much sense as anything else.<br/><br/>So, as a result the Sun isn't as big contributor to the heat of the world, only heating it from 'room temperature'.  Which makes sense, seasons in the fantasy world come from deities, not from the vagaries of orbit.  The sun just happens to be one of the worlds in orbit, and it's a Fire world instead of an Earth world.  The elements are integral to the way Spelljammer works, and I think that's how it should be.<br/><br/>Crystal Spheres were cool, but the Phlogiston was just plain silly.  Instead, the Spheres should be floating directly in the Ethereal plane - and if you sail the wrong way, you make it right to the elemental planes.                        </div>

                            I vote for not sailing into the Plane of Dust. Or Fire. Or Ash. Or really, anything but Air. But it's a cool idea.<br/><br/>I'd want to make the tinker gnomes, if they still exist at all, into a bunch of incompetents stranded on a rock somewhere by their (competent) illusionist cousins, overrun by Giant Space Hamster droppings. A helm run by rubber bands, and I had to pay 100k gold for one? I think not. Also, I think we can do without the Giff - someone like ogre magi can certainly replace them, and we can give the dwarves their guns. The Scro were neat, but they need to be renamed badly.<br/><br/>One of the best things about spelljammer for me was that it brought out the core of every race. Humans had sailing-type ships, elves had treeships, dwarves had floating citadels, illusionist gnomes had conch shells, halflings... wait, halflings had jack shit because they have no racial identity in D&amp;D. Anyway, when you saw a Neogi deathspider, you just *knew* those fuckers were trouble, even if you'd never met them before. <br/><br/>I'd like to see Spelljammer set entirely in crystal spheres mentioned in the "Under the Dark Fist" adventure/campaign. A set of a dozen worlds under the tyrranical vise-grip of a half-medusa dictator and his werewolf-like shock troops. Races that actually seem rather alien. <br/><br/>Oh, and keep the Spelljammer itself (the giant manta ray ship). That was pretty neat.                        </div>

                            Not just Firefly.<br/><br/>Forget the ethereal plane for now.  Nobody can get outside the spheres.  Instead, take a page from Star Trek, of all places.  Sundiving!  Well, not the sun necessarily.<br/><br/>Assume the center of each Crystal Sphere has the way to get out.  Of course, most of these centers contain a planet - sometimes a Fire planet, like a sun, sometimes a more traditional inhabited planet (throw away your heliocentric notions, this is fantasy!).  Perhaps this is necessary - spheres whose centers are empty are much harder to escape, because there's no elemental focus.<br/><br/>Now, you get Navigators.  Keeping with the elemental theme, Navigators need to study each element separately.  A Navigator that only knows Fire, for instance, can only travel out of spheres with a Fire planet in the center, and only TO spheres with a Fire planet in the center.  If you know Fire and Water, you can travel from or to either kind.  And so on.<br/><br/>Of course, you can usually only go to places you know.  Exploration happens when Navigators fail. You still travel.  But you don't wind up where you wanted to go.  Instead, oops, you're now in a new Sphere.  Sometimes, Navigators fail on purpose to find new vistas, but it's always dangerous going into a new Sphere.                        </div>

Lxndr: I'm not familiar with details of Spell jammer. If space was room temperature, did it also have breathable air? That *would* be cool! Or did characters need D&amp;D space suits?<br/><br/>edit: Ask and you shall receive. Wikipedia knows all: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelljammer#The_Fantasy_Astrophysics_of_Spelljammer" rel="nofollow">The Fantasy Astrophysics of Spelljammer</a>:
<blockquote>All bodies of any size carry with them an envelope of air whenever they leave the surface of a planet or other stellar object. Unlike real-world astrophysics, this air envelope is not dispersed by the vacuum of space. These bubbles of air provide breathable atmosphere for varying lengths of time, but 3 months is considered "standard".</blockquote> </div>

                            Yeah, I loved the half-way Spelljammer did.  It's not so stupid as "your mage needs a spacesuit" but it's also not as simplistic as "everywhere there's air!"  Instead, everyone <i>brings their own air</i> with them, but there's only so much.  Ships then become useful not just because they can carry stuff, but they also bring along <i>way more air</i>.  A person in space might last a week, a ship can give its crew months.<br/><br/>The weirdest part of Spelljammer was gravity.  On small things, it was a plane along the largest axis.  On bigger things, it was "towards the center".  So drop an apple over the edge of a ship, it falls, passes the plane of gravity, reverses, falls back up, and so on, yo-yoing back and forth.<br/><br/>I'd be temped to re-define this thusly, ignoring size and focusing on shape:  "As a thing moves towards being more spherical, it has more and more effectively equal 'largest axes' along different planes, and such gravity is <i>effectively</i> a pull towards the center."  This way, you can have, like, inhabited planet-turtles swimming around the ether without worrying about their size being "too big".  Or a disc-world.<br/><br/>But I doubt the nifty ramifications of fantasy astrophysics is what's going to make spelljammer Awesome-o-fied, at least, not in a vacuum if you'll pardon the pun.                        </div>

It could be a scheme, a quest, whatever but you've got a plan to not be a groundling mook and rise into the stars.<br/><br/>Fantasy Trope:  What fantasy trope is your character turning up to 11?                        </div>

                            Freakin' Astromundi Cluster was the bomb!  I'm of the mind that Spelljammer was already Awesome-O-fied, but to make it Awesomer-O-fied, here's what I'd start with.<br/><br/>There's two types of ships: furnace ships and living ships.  Furnace ships are powered by destroying magical items -- the more powerful the magic, the more power the ship gets.  Too much power and boom.  Don't drop the Wand of Orcus in the fires unless you want to float back home.  <br/><br/>Living ships don't just suck magical power from spellcasters, they suck life itself.  Plug into one and sail under normal power, you'll heal yourself back up resting in port.   Or just rotate shifts, with everyone spending a few hours in the chair at once.  But if you try pulling some freaky maneuvers or start amplifying spells through the ship and you'll start peeling days, months, years off your life.  Yeah, that's right -- amplify spells though the ship.  See, with a living ship, you become part of the ship when plugged in.  But for a spellcaster, you can do so much more than just flying.  Cast magic missile while fused to the helm -- It's like firing freaking photon torpedoes.  However, you'll probably wind up with silvered hair when you're done blasting the Armada to kingdom come.<br/><br/>Of course there's also the living ships that might not want you to separate from the helm.  If a ship's Ego score is high enough, it just might keep feeding off of you.                        </div>

                            A few thoughts about Planescape and alignment leads me to this for Spelljammer.<br><br>There's no such thing as gravity planes or points.  Gravity works because people know it works.  You get on a spelljamming ship, you know that the deck is supposed to be below you.  Therefore, everyone stands up the same way on a ship.  Living ships also have Egos, so they instinctively know which way is supposed to be up. So what happens when two ships, sailing at different angles, collide?  Whichever ship has the most people (plus the Ego score of the ship) determines which way is up.  <br/><br/>Now imagine a battle where a small ship collides with a larger one.  Wham, the large ship determines what's up and what's down.  Now the small ship's crew manages to kill a lot of people on the larger one.  Whud!  Gravity shifts again and now the small ship is the dominant gravity force.                        </br></br></div>

                            I worked up this document about 4 years ago with a couple of guys on RPG.net when the Polyhedron/d20 Spelljammer issue came out, and I realized that they weren't going to fix anything about Spelljammer that needed to be.  So I went and made 'Spelljammer Done Right'.<br/><br/>The central change is that there are beams of magical energy (powerful ley lines, really) between the planets and the other bodies of the solar system.  Ships bearing 'crucibles' transform this magical energy into a potential motive force, which is then transformed into kinetic energy by the sails and other steerage parts of the vessel.  Voila - spelljamming ships that actually need sails.  As a joke, we were going to include spelljamming helms as torture devices that evil races used, draining the magical potential of potential mage-children.<br/><br/>The upsides to this change is that you have a reason for bumping into other ships (you're confined to a 'relatively' small channel between worlds); the setting itself is dynamic; and it creates a stable understructure to build other magical means of transport (and magic as a whole) on.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kumapageworks.org/PDFs/beamrigging.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's a link to the basic document for it.</a>  I've been looking to give it a rewrite, but I need to get in contact with one of the other two guys first before I can move on respectably.  90% of the original concept is mine, but some of the details we worked out together.<br/><br/>As to Spelljammer and Serenity - they're conceptually identical, really.  Handwavy quasi-technology that allows for jaunty adventures between worlds.  They're almost identical.                        </div>

                            Must... not... let thread... drop off... first... page...<br/><br/>One of the things I loved about the Astromundi Cluster box set is the lizardmen race.  The default D&amp;D lizardman isn't too smart.  Savages with stone-tipped spears.  But the Astromundi Cluster lizardmen were smarter.  Why?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lWgXDOAJ5s" rel="nofollow">Because they lived closer to the sun.</a>  Now add this:  Your much more intelligent lizardmen, taken from the cluster to distant worlds, take over the local lizard clans.  They organize.  Suddenly, you've got a new player on the scene -- instead of tribes of lizardmen living in the swamp, you've got the start of nations, all connected world to world, sphere to sphere.                        </div>
